  // DELPHIA=0
  "Delphia was the first Hierophant of our Order, chosen and " +
  "anointed by our Mother Dephonia herself at the founding of " +
  "the Order. To her was given the prophetic and power-giving " +
  "Vision which she has preserved in our sacred tomes. Delphia " +
  "lead our people through the persecution while in Argos, " +
  "through the battles for freedom, and finally into the " +
  "tranquility of our sacred forest. She is always portrayed " +
  "in the sacred dress of the one who recieves the Vision, the "+
  "black robe of the Raven encircled with stars and the golden "+
  "medallion of Delphia. To her be all honor and praise forever " +
  "and ever.\n",
 
  // DEMONSTRATES=1
  "Demonstrates was the great warrior who led our people in " +
  "battle in the early days. Our Mother Dephonia blessed him " +
  "with his sacred armour which he wore bravely in battle. " +
  "His glory was crowned with the killing of Argosius who lead "+
  "the infidels against us long ago, aided by the Guardian of " +
  "the forest. " +
  "His armour is still one of the most treasured possessions " +
  "of the Order.\n",
 
  // DEPHONIA=2
  "Dephonia is the Goddess of the Light of Darkness, a mysterious " +
  "life force over which she gives the ability to channel to her " +
  "priests and priestesses. She was born of Archatheos, the king " +
  "of the olden gods, and his mortal High Priestess. Spurned " +
  "because of her mixed heritage, our Mother did not reveal " +
  "herself to mortals until she came to give refuge to those who "+
  "lived in near slavery to the Orders of the gods of Argos in "+
  "ancient times. To the faithful she gave the Light of Darkness, "+
  "as well as many other blessings throughout the history of our " +
  "Order. Her power is the very life force of our existence, and "+
  "to her we give our eternal worship.\n",
 
  // GUARDIAN=3
  "During the great battles in ancient times with the Orders " +
  "of the gods of Argos and with their appointed king, our " +
  "mother Dephonia appeared before our tattered army, prepared "+
  "to face its greatest battle, and called forth from the forest "+
  "a great Guardian to aid us in our struggle. With the aid of " +
  "the guardian, our great hero Demonstrates slew King Argosius "+
  "in battle as well as his winged steed. The guardian has "+
  "the body of a giant muscular man, clothed only in a small "+
  "loincloth, with the head of a great bull. His gaze strikes " +
  "fear in the most courageous of foes, his breath burns their "+
  "skin, and his twisted horns of gold gore through the strongest "+
  "armour. The Guardian is summoned by the Hierophant in times "+
  "of great danger, and then returns to his slumber in the realm " +
  "of the Light of Darkness.\n",
 
  // TALISMAN=4
  "The second great blessing of our Mother Dephonia, the Talisman "+
  "is a sacred instrument which allows its keeper to especially " +
  "channel the Light of Darkness to poison food and drink. It was "+
  "given to the faithful by our Mother in ancient times so that "+
  "they might do away with their most secure enemies.\n",
 
  // VISION=5
  "The Vision was given by our Mother to Delphia as she prayed for "+
  "the goddess' guidance. The vision she recieved was filled " +
  "with apocalyptic prophecy, and with the sacred truths of "+
  "the Light of Darkness. As instructed during the vision, Delphia "+
  "wrote down all that she saw, and these sacred tomes are now " +
  "the scriptures of our Order. The performance of the Ritual " +
  "of the Vision is now the rite of entrance into our Order, to " +
  "recieve the power of the Light of Darkness, and may also "+
  "be performed by others to recieve a great blessing from "+
  "our goddess.\n",
 
  // ALPHA=6
  "The history of our Order begins with the colonization of "+
  "Tritheonopolis, now Argos, when the gods of old rescued "+
  "the remnants of the dying civilization of our pre-historic "+
  "ancestors and brought them to this isolated valley in Calia "+
  "where the new civilation could flourish in isolation. Three "+
  "Orders of the gods were raised to govern the people, but "+
  "these Orders enslaved them, forcing them to toil night and "+
  "day building great marble temples while the people lived in "+
  "tents. It was then that Dephonia appeared to our forefathers "+
  "and promised them freedom and power if they would follow her.\n",
 
  // BETA=7
  "Our mother chose and anointed Delphia to be the first Hierophant "+
  "of our Order, and began to give the power of the Light of "+
  "Darkness to her followers. We struggled in vain to be accepted "+
  "by the ruling Orders of Argos, but like as our Mother was "+
  "rejected by their gods, so were we. Our struggle eventually "+
  "lead to war, and in the final great battle when Demonstrates "+
  "and the Guardian slew King Argosius were we given our freedom "+
  "to live peacefully in our beloved dark forest.\n",
 
  // GAMMA=8
  "Our Mother revealed the place in the forest where we should "+
  "build her temple, and our ancestors labored many decades " +
  "to construct it, but for themselves and not for others as "+
  "they had done in Argos. At the dedication of the temple, "+
  "our Mother appeared and blessed the fruit of our labor, "+
  "filling the shrine with the Light of Darkness, turning "+
  "the marble to black. We have dwelt here in peace ever "+
  "since.\n"
