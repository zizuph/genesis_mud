And then did a sixth Angel of the Light of Darkness appear, and upon
her forehead were written the words of wisdom, and in her hand
she held seven tomes. Trumpets sounded from the billowing darkness,
and the Angel did say, 'Praised be Our Mother who brings the Light
of Darkness!'
 
And the Angel did give unto me the tomes, and instructed me saying,
'Great is the Vision which you have seen. Write down all the wisdom
which you have received, that others may receive the great Blessing
of Our Mother and may feel the power of the Light of Darkness.'
And the Angel was enveloped by the billowing clouds.
 
Behold then did the sacred Raven appear unto me, and she took me
from the dark clouds back to the place where I lay, and said
'Great is the Vision which you have received, and great is the
One who gave it to you. Praise Our Mother forever and ever!'
And the raven did take flight and disappeared into the clouds.
 
He who hath an ear, let him hear, and he who hath eyes, let him
read, that the great Blessing of Dephonia which was given to me
through this Vision may continue forever.
