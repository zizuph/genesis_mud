BOOK IV - The History of Argos
THE REIGN OF ARGOSIUS (37-40 AT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Thirty Seventh Year AT, the Tritheon of dieties established a
monarchy to rule Tritheonopolis, and selected Argosius, a former priest of
Arxes and a military genius, as the founder of the dynasty. Argosius
was given the responsibility of bringing peace to Tritheonopolis and
of making the settlement start to grow culturally.
 
Argosius' first act was to establish a new military guard separate
from the priests of Arxes who had composed the military previously.
This new "secular" guard enjoyed the support of all who saw it as
the hope for peace.  An opposition was formed against the monarchy,
including an unlikely alliance of the still rejected Dephonians and
others who supported rule by the former Tritheonian Council.
 
In the year Forty AT, the final great battle was fought. Argosius lead
his troops from a winged horse, a gift from Pharos, which came to
symbolize the dynasty of his family. The forces of Argosius
were triumphant, driving the Dephonians from the island
territory between the rivers into the surrounding dark forest.
The triumph of Argosius' forces brought peace to the valley, but
Argosius himself was lost in the battle, the victim of one of the
hideous beasts provided to the Dephonians by their evil goddess.
 
In honor of Argosius' accomplishments and martyrdom, Tritheonopolis
was renamed Argos by demand of the populace. The coronation of
Argosius' son in the Fortieth Year marked the end of the era.
