BOOK VI - The History of Argos
THE REIGN OF AGRARIUS (64-89 AT)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agrarius, the third ruler of Argos and son of Paxeus, was coronated in the
Sixty Fourth Year AT. Unlike his father who spent most of his reign
self-indulging in building himself a palace, Agrarius realized the second
responsibility given to his grandfather Argosius, that being nuturing
the well-being of the citizens of Argos.
 
When Agrarius assumed the throne, the lives of the citizens consisted of
construction of marble buildings for the rulers and growing food for their
own families. Agrarius encouraged specialization amongst the populace,
sending farmers into the open fertile regions off the island between
the rivers to grow the food for the city. Those remaining were thus
given the opportunity to develop other skills, such as making wine,
olive oil, jewelry, shoes and other needed items, as well as brass
makers, glass blowers and armourers.
 
The legacy of Agrarius is said to be a living legend...that of the
craftsmanship abilities and happiness of the citizens of Argos.
Agrarius died from a wild boar attack while visiting the wheat fields
near the forests outside the city.
