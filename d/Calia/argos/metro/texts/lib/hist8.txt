BOOK VIII - The History of Argos
THE REIGN OF SOCARTES (112-172 AT)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Socartes, the fifth monarch of Argos, assumed the throne in the One Hundredth
and Twelfth Year AT, after having spent much of his youth in the temple
of Thema under the tutelage of the priestesses, a rare opportunity for
a male citizen.
 
Socartes had witnessed the rapid growth in the Argosian culture under
his father's rule, to the point where many Argosians now found themselves
with leisure time. Socartes believed that all would benefit from having
some sort of education, even if only enough to read and write to keep
records for a business or farm. Socartes also believed that the artisan
and crafts skills, which had always been handed down from father to son,
were in danger of being lost if a certain family happened upon a mass
tragedy.
 
Thus Socartes established a school where all Argosian children received
a basic education, and where master craftsmen and artisans taught
apprentices their skills. Socartes had an Academy constructed next
to the palace to ensure that his educational beliefs remained a permanent
part of the culture of Argos. Socartes died of old age while teaching
principles of commerce in the Academy which became his legacy.
