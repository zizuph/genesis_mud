Arxes - the Argosian God of War and Strength
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Arxes is one of the three dieties worshipped by the people of Argos,
who together are called the Tritheon. Arxes and the other tritheonian
gods were instrumental in the salvaging of what was to become the
Argosian culture and founding the city many years ago. As with the
other tritheonian gods, Arxes founded an order of priests to follow
him and to minister to the people of Argos.
 
The followers of Arxes, called Arxesian Priests, worship their god
by teaching and maintaining the martial arts and the importance of
physical and military strength. Known of as the best fighters of the
city, the Arxesian priests train most of the military for the city.
The Arxesians are known to be the most isolationists of the three
orders of the city, rumored to still have many supporters of Kretos,
one of their adherents, still amongst their ranks.
 
The symbol of Arxes is the falcon, a swift bird of prey often captured
and trained by Arxesian priests for military purposes. Arxes gives
a special power to control the mighty birds to those ordained into
his order. His temple is located on the western side of town, where
his favored form of worship is the offering of courage and valor
won in battle.
