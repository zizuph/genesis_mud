Alexis - the Sage of Argos
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexis was born in the year 205 AT, the son of a blacksmith. He became
a seeker of knowledge at a very young age and eventually entered the
Academy of Argos. Alexis always wondered about the world outside of
his isolated valley, and dreamed of travelling beyond the mountains,
an idea considered heresy by most. He befriended Prince Biblionus,
son of Thespia the ruling monarch and heir to the throne, with whom
he shared his dream of exploring the outside world.
 
After Biblionus became king, he secretly granted Alexis permission
to explore the world beyond the mountains. Though a bit old for such
an expedition, Alexis left the secluded valley and set out on an
adventure. He visited most of the known domains of the world at the
time, made many friends, and collected a great deal of knowledge.
He wrote down everything he saw, and brought back to Argos stories,
items and skills from the many lands he visited.
 
Upon his return he was threatened by some of the powerful isolationists
of the city, but with popular support and that of his friend the
king, he soon became a hero. Most of his writings and items were
kept secret by the isolationist society, but he was known to tell
stories to anyone who would ask. Because of his great wisdom and
experience, he was eventually given the title "Sage of Argos."
 
Alexis is very old now, but still lives in the city, usually spending
his days in the park. He is known to send newcomers to Argos on
tours throughout the city.
