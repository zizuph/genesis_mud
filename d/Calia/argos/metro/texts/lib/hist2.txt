BOOK II - The History of Argos
THE DIVINE ERA (0-8 AT)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Remnants of the collapsing civilization were brought to the valley
in what is now the year Zero Argosian Time. The first settlers
were selectively chosen, including farmers, artisans, builders,
and those with leadership abilities. The original settlement was
made of tents, used for many things to the present time, and was
given the name TRITHEONOPOLIS in honour of the rescuing dieties.
 
Within a year, a religious Order was established by each of the
three gods to assist in the nuturing given by the deities. Naturally,
the brightest and strongest were chosen as members. The Orders still
hold their original members and High Priests/Priestesses in high
esteem, as they were directly chosen and anointed by their respecitve
deities.
 
Another goddess, about which little is still known, named Dephonia,
called the goddess of Evil by most Argosians, was also interested in
the settlement. For unknown reasons, Dephonia was rejected by the
Tritheon, but secretly established an Order of her own in the settlement
in an attempt to gain influence.
 
By the seventh year, riots and fights between the Dephonian disciples
and those of the Tritheon began to rip the settlement apart. The
Pantheon of gods, tired of the constant struggle, banned all the
dieties from having direct influence on the culture, deciding it
to be best to let the culture survive or die on its own. Thus
Zima, of Calia, was asked to be caretaker, and the government of
the settlement was given to a council consisting of the three
High Priets/Priestesses of the Orders. This action in the Eighth
Year AT ended the Divine Era and ushered in the Tritheonian Council Era.
