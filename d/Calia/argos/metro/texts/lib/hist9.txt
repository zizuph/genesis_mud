BOOK IX - The History of Argos
THE REIGN OF COLLISIMUS (172-189 AT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collisimus, the sixth king of Argos, was the third son of Socartes, born
late in his father's life. Both of this brothers had been mysteriously
killed while hunting in the woods, the culprits never found.
 
Collisumus cared little for the academic pursuits of his father, and
spent most of his life in the Temple of Arxes learning how to fight
and military strategy. Collisimus greatly enjoyed the games and
wrestling matches in the Temple of Arxes, and established games and
physical contests as an important part of life in Argos.
 
Under the rule of Collisimus, a great arena was built especially for
the contests, often pitting fighters against wild beasts and each
other in battles to the death. The military was also greatly enlarged
under his rule, requiring all young Argosian men to spend two years
in military training. The generals of the army became politically
powerful, and a military representative was eventually given a seat
on the Council which to date had only consisted of the High Priests/
Priestesses of the religious Orders.
 
Collisimus met an early death when, enraged that one of his favored
champions had been killed by a captured Dephonian warrior, he leapt
into the Arena and was run through with his own sword. Collisimus
died with only one daughter, who's claim to the throne was insecure
due to her gender. The Arena stands as the monument to the short rule
of the sixth king.
