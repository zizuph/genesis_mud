Pharos - The Argosian God of Life
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pharos is one of the three gods worshipped by the people of Argos, one
of the Tritheon who was instrumental in founding and nuturing the
city of Argos. Like the other dieties of the city, Pharos has an
order of priests and priesstesses who spend their lives in worship
to him and ministry to the people. As the god of life, Pharosian
priests are known of as healers of mind, body and soul. Their
worship of Pharos seems to bring a great inner peace and happiness
to his followers.
 
The temple of Pharos is located on the east side of the city, and is
visited often by those who are sick. The people often bring not only
themselves and their families to the temple, but also their livestock
and other animals in need of healing. The priests and priestesses spend
much time in prayer to Pharos for rain and for the health of crops,
making Pharos especially adored by the farmers of the society.
The Pharosians are the most charitable of the three orders, collecting
funds for the poor of the city. They are known to be the most supportive
of the king in his attempts to contact the outside world, wishing to
bring the power of their god to all who seek him.
