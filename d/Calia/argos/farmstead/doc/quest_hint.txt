Swirls of black mist fill the orb momentarily, then fade to reveal a bird's eye
view of the city of Argos. The orb takes you on a trip down Alpharon road,
through the eastern gate, up an overgrown trail and finally you find yourself
looking at a ramshackle farmhouse. As you look into the orb, an eerie wailing
resonates throughout your head.
