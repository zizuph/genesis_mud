The abandoned farmstead

Located just off Alpharon road east of Argos can be found an abandoned
farmstead, consisting of a farmhouse, a toolshed, a partially
collapsed barn and an overgrown field.

A small group of brigands occupy the farmyard between the farmstead
buildings. If asked, they will warn the player about going into the farmhouse,
which they claim is haunted by a ghost. They don't have much else to say but
will boast amongst themselves about their many lowly acts of robbery, so the
player shouldn't feel too bad about disposing of them.

Their leader drops some non-magical gear (a leather armour and a weapon)
of fair quality, suitable for a small to mid-sized player, but otherwise they
possess nothing of interest.

Inside the farmhouse the player will find the ghost of a woman. The ghost will
moan and complain about their woes, giving the players some keywords that they
can be asked about.

The ghost will say that they are awaiting the return of their husband, for whom
they have prepared supper, and ask the player if they can go and see what's
taking their husband so long.

The player must then recover the toothless skull of the husband from the
partially collapsed barn. The ghost will be horrified at the sight of the skull
- and not at all convinced that this is their husband (who had splendid teeth
and a full head of thick, fair hair), so the players must find a few pebbles to
act as replacement dentures, gather some wheat straws to act as hair and cook a
turnip soup that the ghost can serve. Upon sharing a meal with their husband,
the ghost will find peace and final rest, and the player will receive a small
quest xp reward.
