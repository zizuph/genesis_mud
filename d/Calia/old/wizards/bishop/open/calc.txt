Okay.. let me try this. I'm ignoring the randoms.


fixnorm does this: offence * 100 / (offence + def) - 50.

def is parry + defence.

Since the tohit_val is 0 when we evaluate cb_tohit, whether we
hit or not solely depends on the fixnorm evaluation.

So, we will hit if..

offence * 100 / (offence + parry + defence) - 50 > 0.

offence * 100 / (offence + parry + defence) > 50      | * (off+defence+parry)

offence * 100 > 50 offence + 50 defence + 50 parry    | divide by 50 and move

2*offence - offence - parry > defence

offence - parry > defence

That's what we end up with.. so if defence is reduced by 25 %..

offence - parry > 0.75 defence

(offence - parry)/0.75 > defence


Meaning the left side increases by 33%.. and since that is the chance of
hitting.

Does that sound correct to you? If it isn't, I plead sleepiness. :)
