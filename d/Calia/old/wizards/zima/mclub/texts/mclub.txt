************************************************************************
What is it?
   It is a CLUB open to players/wizards who are former members of the
   defunct Ancient Order of the Mystics and any others they desire
   to allow association to.
 
What is its purpose?
   It is a fellowship to perpetuate the friendships bonded in the now
   defunct Order, and to perpetuate the record of the historical
   existence of the Order.
 
How does one join? What are the requirements for membership?
   One becomes a member by being inducted through an initiation ceremony.
   The ceremony requires two current members to induct the initiate.
   Thus by decision of two current members, a new person may join.
   (NOTE: The first two mortal members will be inducted by the
   founding wizards - Zima and Digit - after which inductions may only
   be done by mortal members.)
 
How does the initiation work?
   - It must take place in the sanctuary (shsanct.c) - actions are here.
   - Must have 2 current members and the initiate in room (more OK)
   - All who participate must wear a white robe (found in sacristry)
   - Incense cloud must be present. The incense is found in the cabinet of
     the sacristry, and may be used in the sanctuary only, using the
     command 'load incense.' Shortly thereafter a cloud of incense will
     appear and remain for a time.
   - Initiate must 'kneel before the altar'
   - One member must do 'lay hands on <name of initiate>'
   - A second member must do the same (others are welcome if present)
   - One member must do 'induct <name of initiate> <title>'
     The title is "inscribed" on the string of beads which is then
     given to the initiate. The title shows up as a subloc whenever
     the member wears the beads.
   - Initiate may 'rise' from kneeling when finished.
 
How does a member leave?
   By going to the sanctuary, kneeling, and typing 'break bond'. This
   removes the cmdsoul, the string of beads, and the name from the
   member list.

What area/structures is the club to include?
   A shrine has been built which serves the two purposes stated earlier.
   The upper level of the shrine is accessible to any player, member or
   not, and serves as a monument/memorial. The lower level serves as
   the "club house" or private quarters of the members. The conclave
   includes:
   - A starting location room with a standard bulletin board
   - A meeting room
   - A library where members may write prose, poetry, history, etc.
   - A storage room which includes a cabinet with items needed for
     the ceremonies of the club, as well as a chest to store items
     (not a keep-past-reboot weapons rack)
 
What are the access restrictions?
   There are no "supernatural" restrictions on access to ANY part
   of the club area. "natural" access is restricted with the use
   of doors/keys at 2 points:
   Gate: - a gate guards the entrance to the area around the shrine.
           One key exists which is kept in the private part of the shrine.
           It is expected that this gate will remain open at all times
           unless a private ceremony is being held in the "public" part
           of the shrine (initiations occur in the sanctuary of the
           "public" part)
   Bell Tower Door: - a door guards the passage from the "public" part
           to the lower private part. An unlimited # of keys are
           available in the private part of the shrine (for those
           who choose to start there) and from an NPC "gardner" who
           meanders through the area, giving keys to any member who
           asks (for those who start elsewhere).
   Thus it is the responsibility of members to keep doors locked at all
   times.
 
What are the objects available to members?
   string of stone prayer beads - this is the "club item" which contains
           the cmdsoul. It is given at the time of initiation.
   keys (see above)
   Ceremonial paraphanelia - including 5 robes, 2 mantles, an alb and
           10 quanties of incense (useful only in the shrine as a
           "special effect")
           Note: all items are available "free of charge" but have no
           monetary value. These items should normally not be used outside
           of the shrine.
 
What are the functional "benefits" offered by the club?
   - Access to the private area (security maintained by members)
   - A bulletin board
   - A library (implemented as a bulletin board) where members can
     write prose, poetry, history, etc.
   - A permanent starting location inside the private area
   - A meeting room with "no snoop" semi-protection
   - A cabinet containing the ceremonial paraphenalia.
   - A chest for storage (used as a "weapons rack" but does NOT
     maintain contents during reboot)
 
Description of area:
  -A path with a gate connects the area to the "outside world"
  -The "plus" or "cross" shaped stone shrine sits on top of a steep
   round hill hidden in the woods. A circular path leads around the
   hill (oXX on map) with an oak tree growing on each of the 12 spots.
  -Entrances to the interior of the shrine are on the north west and
   south sides (steps leading up the side of the hill.)
  -outdoor gardens are set in the nw and sw corners
  -the se corner is a bell tower which leads to the lower level
