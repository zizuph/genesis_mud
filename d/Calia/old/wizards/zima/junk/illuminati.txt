                       THE ORDER OF THE ILLUMINATI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In General:
The Order of the Illuminati is an occupational magic-users' guild. It is
mystical in nature and hierarchical in organization and government.
The Illuminati seek for "illumination" in Truth through the pursuit of
Wisdom cloaked in Mystery, the applications of which are promoted
throughout the general society for Good while guarding the secret
of such knowledge from which they derive their magical powers.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Membership Levels:
Membership is divided amongst 5 major hierarchical orders. Admission to a
higher order is granted only by a vote of the Magisterium (council). Progression
through the sub-titles of each order are made automatically as the player
acquires experience in the game. Admission to a higher major order can
only be done when the member is at the highest sub-title of his/her current
major order. Promotions are made through a ceremony, which may be conducted
by an Episcopos or Presbyter, a Presbyter when raised to Episcopos, and
by the Hierophant when raised to a Presbyter.

Admission to the Order: (steps of progression)
Seeker of Illumination:
  A player who wishes to join must receive the Diakonotic Blessing, which
  can be granted by any member of Diakonos level or higher. The player
  then becomes a Seeker of Illumination. An auto-loading/non-loosable
  object is given to the Seeker to identify him/her as such (when blessed).
  This object will identify the progression of the Seeker in a subloc
  description (ie: He is a Seeker of Illumination,etc)
  PREREQ: Player must be on the "good" side of neutral in alignment
 
Worthy Seeker of Illumination:
  The Seeker must solve an entrance quest to prove his/her worthiness
  to continue.
 
Accepted Seeker of Illumination:
  The Magisterium votes (by majority) to accept the Worthy Seeker.
  The Worthy Seeker may return to the Temple of the Order at any time
  to check on his acceptance through a meditation. Once accepted
  by the Magisterium, the Worthy Seeker becomes an Accepted Seeker
  upon meditation in the Temple.
 
Neophyte: - actually joins the Order
  Accepted Seekers must be initiated into the Order of Neophytes by
  a ceremony, which may be conducted by any Episcopos or Presbyter.
  PREREQ: must still be on "good" side of evil; must belong to no other guilds.
 
Expulsion from the rank of Seeker:
  any Episcopos or Presbyter may remove the Seeker status (and thus the
  seeker object) from a seeker at any time.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaving the Order:
Any member who leaves the Order will die automatically and immediately
loose any skills learned in the Order. The apostate will not be
automatically considered an enemy of the Order as long as he/she maintains
the secrecy learned within the Order and makes no hostile acts towards
the Order.
 
A member may be expelled from the Order by a majority vote of the
Magisterium. Such members will not die and will not loose any skills
learned.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Governance of the Order:
Hierophant:
   - the supreme ruler of the Order. Holds all legislative, judicial and
     executive powers not explicitly given to other members/bodies.
   - Selected (and dismissed if necessary) by the guildmaster
The Magisterium is composed of all Presbyters of the Order. It is
    responsible for:
    - electing seekers (by majority vote)
    - approving promotions of members to higher major ranks (by majority vote)
    - advising the Hierophant
    - demoting members of its own body.
      NOTE: an inactive member whose inactivity makes it difficult or
            impossible to acquire majority or unanimous votes may be
            moved to the Order of Episcopos. This is not considered
            a demotion, and the member should be restored to Presbyter
            as soon as he/she becomes active again.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restrictions of Membership:
- All members must stay on the "good" side of neutral; failure to do so
  automatically results in loss of all guild abilities/privileges.
- All members must submit to the authority of the Hierophant and Magisterium
- No member may belong to any other guild. Membership in clubs may be
  allowed by the vote of the Magisterium, though membership in any such
  club should not be detrimental in any way to the honor or unity of
  the Order.

  which a the guild item and is used as a polearm weapon. (Exceptions

  Specific rules and judgements set by the Hierophant and Magisterium.
- Absolute unity must be striven for in the Order; under no circumstances
  should a member display disunity toward the Order or any member

  other members or teaming with enemies of the Order. The Hierophant
  and Magisterium are responsible for making regulations to maintain
  the unity of the Order.
