                            The Gaelic Order
==============================================================================
NOTE: Any suggestions for a better name?? I'll keep "Gael" for now.
General:
   The Gaelic Order is a guild of priests who channel the power of
   Order of the Triad by use of rituals and encantations. They are
   "good" aligned and open to all races (though divided by race...see below).
   Technically they are a combination of an occupational cleric guild
   and a layman fighter guild (specializing in defense and polearm).
 
History:
   The Order is one of the 16 which composed The Wise of long ago, and
   which faded to a small group during the Age of Might. They retreated
   to an island and built their cathedral and priory which serves as
   the Order's center. They remained cloistered in their priory until
   recently, and are now taking accepting new members and establishing
   "kirks" in various villages and towns in the domain.
 
Theology:
   The Gaelic priests are Order-aligned, with the unique belief that
   perfect order, or perfect harmony with order, can be attained by
   performing specific rituals and living a ritualistic life of order.
   By performing the rituals, the priest comes in close enough harmony
   with perfect order that they are able to manipulate the physical world.
   They are aided in their efforts by their "saints" (founders) who
   attained perpetual perfect harmony with Order and were "absorbed
   into it" long ago. Obedience to tradition and to superiors plays a
   very important part in the lives of the priests.
 
Organization:
   The Order will be divided into Kirks. A Kirk is established in one of
   the towns of the domain, and each Kirk is of the race of the town.
   A Kirk is governed by an Episkopos, and consists of 4 to 10 members
   including himself, with a maximum of four Presbyters. A kirk
   may also be established for those races (ie. gnomes, hobbits) who are
   foreign to the domain in a large town or a rural area.
 
   The Archepiskopos governs the entire Order from the Cathedral, appointing
   Episkopoi for each Kirk. The Cathedral itself serves as a mixed-race
   kirk, the Archepiskopos assigning members there as he sees fit. He is
   elected by the Snoyd of the Episkopoi (council) and must be approved
   by the guildmaster.
 
   The Archepiskopos assigns each member to a kirk as he sees fit,
   though racial requirements and limits must be followed, and tradition
   holds that a new member shall be assigned to the kirk which recruited
   him (if there is more than one for a race) unless a balance of numbers
   is sought. The Archepiskopos may also reassign members to kirks, again
   within racial and numeric limits.
 
   The Snoyd of the Episkopoi consists of the Archepiskopos and all the
   Episkopoi of the Order. It is primarily an advisory council for the
   Archepiskopos and the guildmaster. Its three official powers are electing
   the Archepiskopos and establishing new kirks, both with guildmaster
   approval, and electing Presbyters to be consecrated to the office of
   Episkopos.
 
Entrance:
   One who seeks to enter the Order should seek out the members of a
   Kirk of his/her race (the Cathedral if none has yet been established
   for their race). The Episkopos or any of his presbyters may accept
   the seeker. The seeker would then complete a quest, and present
   himself to the Episkopos for acceptance as a Neophyte. Once accepted,
   a mentor/sponsor is assigned to the Neophyte, and the Neophyte is
   assigned to the Cathedral for training.
 
Promotion:
   To Oblate:
      When the Archepiskopos, or his appointee who oversees the Neophytes,
      decides the Neophyte is ready, the Neophyte is promoted to Oblate
      and assigned to a Kirk, givining allegiance to the Episkopos of
      that Kirk. (most likely the sponsoring Kirk).
   To Friar, Diakon, Presbyter:
      The Episkopos of the Kirk promotes members as he sees fit, keeping
      to the limit of 4 presbyters. The Episkopos may also demote members.
   To Episkopos:
      The Snoyd must elect a Presbyter to be consecrated to this office.
      An Episkopos may be consecrated to govern a Kirk only (thus one
      Episkopos per Kirk), with the exception that the Archepiskopos may
      have two assistant Episkopoi at the Cathedral.
   To Archepiskopos:
      The Snoyd elects the Archepiskopos, who is approved and consecrated
      by the guildmaster. The Snoyd may remove an Archepiskopos, who must
      be demoted by the guildmaster.
 
   Promotion of the sub-levels (ie: Gaelic Neophyte to Learned Gaelic
   Neophyte) will be automatic based on general XP and/or a guild XP
   based on performance of rituals, acts of piety, etc. A member must
   have advanced to the highest sublevel before he/she can be promoted
   to the next level, except in special circumstances by the Archepiskopos.

Spells:
   THIS IS A _WORKING_ LIST
   The number of spells (and thus the guild tax) will increase as a
   member is promoted. Though this is a clerical order, with their
   history of warfare, they have developed good defensive/offensive
   skills as well. Spell effects may be increased by two or more
   members "linking." Linking will be a special skill.
   Here is a "working list" of spells types I expect for an Episkopos:
   Divination:
      Divine ALIGNMENT of player: spell causes player to react in a way
                             showing alignment (good/evil/neutral).
      Divine NAME of player: (mind control) spell causes player to
                             introduce himself or speak his name.
      Divine LOCATION of introduced player: spirit whispers room short
                             description of the player.
      Divine BLESSING of player: has player received Gaelic blessing?
      Divine INVISIBLE: detect invisible objects in a room (except wizzes)
   Offense/Defense:
      Beam of Light - simple attack spell
      Bind - prevent enemy from moving/leaving the room
      Force enemy to drop or unwield weapon
      Holy ground - anoint ground with oil to cause evil players to
                    decrease security.
      "spook" - scare player into running into an adjoining room.
      Peace - stop fighting in a room.
   Conjuration:
      Conjure a floating orb of LIGHT (torch spell).
 
   Healing:
      Strengthen - decrease tiredness
      Heal Poison
 
   Other?:
      Talk (send message) to any mortal.
      Bless player (advanced emote) - simply adds a GAEL_BLESSED prop which
            grants special status to the player (immunity to Gael offensive
            spells, admission to secret areas, etc.)
      Embrace - a member must embrace the "power of Order" to channel it.
                a member must be "in embrace" to cast any spell. The
                embrace lasts a certain period of time, decreases mana
                and "communion with Order" slightly, and my be broken off
                at any time (special skill trained).
      Link - 2 or more members may link (embrace the power of Order)
             together to increase their spell effectiveness. Increases
             loss of mana/communion rate of embrace. (special skill trained).
