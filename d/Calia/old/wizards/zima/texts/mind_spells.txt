Spells for the Cleric Guild:
 
If its OKed with admin, I'm proposing that the clerics' primary ability
be "mind control," and any spell which can be fit into that category
will. Here's a list of such spells:
 
Voice of the Heart:
   forces the player to say a phrase "from the heart" which
   reveals the player's alignment (GOOD/EVIL etc).
 
Introduce:
   forces the player to introduce himself.
 
Unwield/Drop:
   forces the player to unwield and/or drop a wielded weapon. On NPCs,
   the npc would auto-rewield after given period of time.
 
Move:
   forces a player to take an exit (wimpy or directed wimpy).
 
Strike:
   forces a player to strike himself with his own weapon.
 
Attack:
   Force a player to attack something
 
Paralyze Legs:
   paralyzes the player so he can't leave (take an exit; blocking)
 
Mind reading:
   allows cleric to "snoop" a player; player must be in room, or perhaps
   cleric can put some object on the player (sneakily) that allows distant
   mind reading.
 
Illusion of Shape Change:
   cleric seems to change shape to a griffin or other creature, any attackers
   would be fighting that NPC; cleric invisible, can walk away; when spell
   wears off, cleric visible and griffin vanishes.
