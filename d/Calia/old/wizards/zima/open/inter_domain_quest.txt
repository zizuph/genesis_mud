                      Tombs of the Apostoloi Quest
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an interdomain quest which requires the player to visit the
tombs of the Apostoloi.
 
The Apostoloi were 6 "missionaries" of an Argosian (in Calia) religion
who were sent out about 250 years ago to spread their faith. Some of
them had limited success, with a small group of followers which
survived for a short time, while others were killed before they had
a chance to make one convert. In all cases, none of the "missions"
was successful, and the only remnants of the religion remain in
Argos at this time.
 
However, a tomb was constructed for each of these in the foreign lands
where each died. Depending on how the cooperating domains wish to
include it, the tombs could be in small shrines, or in a cave. They
could be located anywhere the cooperating domain wished it, and could
fit into the history of the domain anyway they wish, or not at all
(perhaps the missionary was killed as soon as he/she stepped off
the boat in a given domain). The bare minimum I need is one room
in a cooperating domain, and some kind of history on what the
missionary did/where they went before they died.
 
Though this quest will be available to everyone in the game, it will
probably end up as the entrance quest (or part of it) for a cleric
guild I'm working on now. Any help anyone could give would be
greatly appreciated.
