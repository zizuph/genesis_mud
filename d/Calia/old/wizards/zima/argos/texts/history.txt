A History of Argos:
 
Argos was established when three gods, THEMA (Goddess of Wisdom),
XIMAS (God of War and Strength) and PHAROS (God of Nature and Life),
rescued the remnants of a dieing civilization (implicitly Ancient Greek)
and brought them to Genesis, in an attempt to preserve their culture
through isolation.  Caliana (or whoever the ruler of Calia turns out
to be) granted them an uninhabited valley in her realm of Calia,
where a river splits and rejoins, creating an island in the middle
of the valley, on which Argos was built.
 
An order of priests/priestesses was organized for each of
the beloved gods, and a temple built in the city for each.  The
three gods also ordained a King, whose descendants have ruled Argos
and kept it isolated ever since.
 
The current monarch, COSMOPOLITUS, however, feels that the culture is
now strong enough to commune with the outside world, and with
Caliana's permission, has built a road connecting Argos to the
rest of Calia.  His decision, however, has been met with fear
and rebellion by some of his subjects.  An elite group of Argosian
warriors, called Kretans, have sought to overthrow the King for
years, and have now left the city and set up a camp outside of
town in open rebellion.   Though they are somewhat leary, the
priests/priestesses of the three temples have accepted the
King's decision, along with the citizens in the city.
 
Another goddess, as yet unnamed, the goddess of EVIL, was snubbed by
the three gods in the founding of the city, so she established
her own temple in the woods outside of the city.
 
 
GOVERNMENT:
Argos is ruled by the King, advised by a council composed of representatives
of the temples, the military, and the citizens.  This council is
currently in debate over what to do about the rebels, and voice
some reservations they still have about opening the city.
 
REBEL PLOT:
The Kretans have planned to overthrow the king, by moving on his palace
and his allies (the temples) simultaneously.  Kretan warriors can
be found hiding throughout the city, awaiting the time of attack.
Some of the priests of XIMAS, naturally inclined to the military
ways of the Kretans, also plan to overthrow their own High Priest
and aid the Kretans in their evil plot. (Thus the Kretans and
these priests are EVIL, the rest are GOOD).  The Kretans also
roam the new road to Calia, attacking travellers, in an effort to
discourage them from entering the city.
