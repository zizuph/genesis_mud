2nd 100 year period:
   Replace "Argos closes its gates..." with
   "Peoples from a distant land secretly settle in a secluded valley
   in central Calia, founding the hidden city of Argos."
 
3rd 100 year period:
   Add: "Argos continues to grow in seclusion, and constructs its pillared,
         marble structures"
         (unimportant, really...leave it out if you like)
 
The most recent century:
  About the time of the birth of Caliana: (in that 20 year period).
  "Alexis, first Argosian to leave the valley, travels widely. First
  contact with outside world."
 
  About 20 years ago from current day (perhaps right after Caliana
  disappears):
  "First official delegation from Argos to Gelan (or where-ever) to
  establish relations; construction of marble road begins"
