 
This is a detailed description of the first Part of Argos to be opened.
It is the road from the rest of Calia to Argos.  Since Argos is in a
hidden valley in Calia, the road goes over a small mountainous area,
into the valley, and follows the river to the gates of the city.
The gates will be closed initially, until the city is ready to be opened.
 
 
Connection point.
 
I thought a good place to connect the road was on the part of the
Crystalline road with all the sw/ne directions.  The road will
not be "finished", so it will start out as a path through the
woods, then turn into a white marble road at some point.
At this point, workers will be "building" the road.
Merlin reviewed v1 of this doc and likes the starting location.

SPECIALS:
  To add a little humor, a player will get messages about smelling something
  when in the sheep pasture, and about small mounds laying on the ground.
  When he enters P7, he will "step in" this, and from then on, will
  have a message like "A foul odor reaks from Joe's splatters shoes"
  or something like that.  There will be a washbowl in the shepherd's
  house where the "odor" can be washed off.
