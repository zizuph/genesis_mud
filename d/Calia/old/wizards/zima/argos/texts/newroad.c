 
This is a detailed description of the first Part of Argos to be opened.
It is the road from the rest of Calia to Argos.  Since Argos is in a
hidden valley in Calia, the road goes over a small mountainous area,
into the valley, and follows the river to the gates of the city.
The gates will be closed initially, until other parts of the road
are open.
 
Suggested connection point.
 
I thought a good place to connect the road was on the part of the
Crystalline road with all the sw/ne directions.  The road will
not be "finished", so it will start out as a path through the
woods, then turn into a white marble road at some point.
At this point, workers will be "building" the road.
I thought to make it interesting, the workers could start out
closer to Argos, and as each new area opens, I would move the
"finish line" closer to the crystaline road, until finally, one
day, when Argos is complete, the road will connect, or almost
connect, to the crystalline road:

The road will of course jag a little (ne e se, etc), and a few ups/downs
will be used to simulate going over the mountains.  Small paths
will lead off the road closer to the city to a small shepherd's area
and a vineyard.  The road ends at the closed city gates.  Since the
road has woods on one side, other rooms making the woods may
shoot off a little to the north of the road (the river is to the
south)
 
BUILDINGS:  Sheepherd's home; Vineyardman's home
 
NPCs:  (Bad) Kretan (Rebel) Warriors, roaming the roads "discouraging"
             outsiders from using the road by attacking on sight.
 
       (Good) Road Builders and their guards
              Guards at the city gates
              VineyardsMan, Shepherd, and sheep

This is only the first part, as the road will be enhanced at a later time
to include other interesting side areas along the way.
