BOOK I - History of Argos - PreHistory
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Little is known about the origins of the people of Argos. All that
is known is that once there was an ancient civilization which was
collapsing due to influences from other cultures. The gods
worshipped by these people, now known only as The Pantheon collectively,
saw this disentegration but did little about it.  Three of the gods,
Arxes (the god of War and Strength), Thema (The goddess of Wisdom) and
Pharos (the god of Life and Healing) came up with a plan which
might save the culture. They decided to take the remnants of the
civilization to a totally isolated place where it could grow and
become stronger.
 
Thus the three gods, now called The Tritheon, discovered an unknown
isolated valley in the land of Calia. The valley was completely hidden
from the rest of Calia, with a mountain range between the two.
A river runs through the valley, splitting and rejoining, making
an island of sorts in the middle. It was upon this island that
the remnants were established. The founding of this settlement
marks the beginning of Argosian Time (AT) in the year 0.
