BOOK X - The History of Argos
THE RULE OF THESPIA (189-222 AT)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thespia, the daughter and only child of Collisimus, made a very unstable
ascent to the throne of Argos in the One Hundred and Eighty Ninth Year
AT. At the time of her father's death, the Argosian military had become
a very strong force in the city's ruling structure. The military leaders,
believing Thespia, as a woman, could not rule the city, challenged her
birthright in the Council. A compromise was eventually worked out,
averting a military take over of Argos, in which the military was
given a certain degree of autonomy from the throne. The commander of
the army still made allegiance to the throne, but had full control
of its own internal affairs. The queen also agreed to marry a powerful
colonel, ensuring the military's influence in the palace.
 
Thespia had spent most of her life in the Academy of Argos, and had
become interested in writing and acting. An avid author herself,
Thespia encouraged and developed the arts in Argos, eventually
building an amphitheatre and founding a guild of actors, which
called themselves the Thespian Guild after their benefactor. Thespia
also had a park constructed in Argos, its centerpiece a beautiful
fountain in the middle of a clear pool. Thespia died in middle age
from poisoning in her food, a mysterious murder to this day.
