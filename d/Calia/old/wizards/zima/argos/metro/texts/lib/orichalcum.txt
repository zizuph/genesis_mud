Orichalcum
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orichalcum is a metal alloy made of Gold and Copper. The metal has a
fiery red color and is often used for armours and other such objects
in the city of Argos. Alexis brought the knowledge of and skill to
forge the metal back with him from his long journey abroad, from
a place called Thalassia, a group of islands in the domain of Calia.
Alexis found the people of Thalassia to be very similar to those
of Argos, and forged a close relationship with them, for which they
gave him the secret of this useful metal.
