BOOK VII - The History of Argos
THE REIGN OF BASILEUS (89-112 AT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basileus, the fourth ruler of Argos, was crowned king in the Eighty
Ninth Year AT at a time when craftsmanship and artisanry were fully
developing in Argos.
 
Basileus' reign is noted for his construction of the commercial district
of Argos.  Basileus had beautiful marble structures built where
craftsmen and traders could carry on their business in the luxury of the
permanent buidings enjoyed by the royal family and the religous Orders.
 
Basileus also supervised the construction of streets through the
city, and established a monetary system, replacing the old barter
system with coins.  The commercial district in Argos is sometimes
still referred to as 'Basileus' Squares', referring to the layout
of the district.  Basileus died in a fall from a winged horse,
which was attacked in mid air by ravens as it flew over the dark
forest.
