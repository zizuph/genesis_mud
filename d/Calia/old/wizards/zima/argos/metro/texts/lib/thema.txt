Thema - The Argosian Goddess of Wisdom
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thema is one of the three dieties worshipped by the people of Argos,
one of the tritheonian gods who founded the city. She founded an order
of priestesses who seek the power to be had in great wisdom. The most
secretive of the three orders of the city, the Themans keep mostly
inside their temple, which is located on the north side of the city.
 
Thema grants various supernatural powers to those who seek wisdom
in her temple, though the shroud of secrecy protects knowledge of
what exactly happens there. Theman priestesses serve Argos as
counselors and educators. The symbol of the goddess is the owl, a
bird which is often utilized as a guardian and spy for the order.
It is said in Argos that the hoot of an owl is voice of Thema
saying "I am watching over you." The favored worship of Thema is
the search for knowledge dedicated to her service.
