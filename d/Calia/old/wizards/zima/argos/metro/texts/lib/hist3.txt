BOOK III - The History of Argos
THE TRITHEONIAN COUNCIL ERA (8-37 AT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Eight Year AT, the High Priests of Pharos and Arxes, and the High
Priestess of Thema, were ordained by the Tritheon to be the governing
body of Tritheonoplis. Without the direct prodding of the deities,
tensions between the Dephonian disciples and the Tritheonian followers
died down, the Dephonians going "underground," keeping their membership
secret, in hopes they would eventually be accepted.
 
The Tritheonian Council Era was marked by the self-serving government
of the ruling Orders. Nearby marble deposits where used to build three
enormous temples for the ruling Orders. Almost everyone was required
to work in the marble mines or the construction sites, with criminal
penalties usually involving massive amounts of extra work being assigned.
 
As the temples neared completion in the Thirty Fourth Year AT, the
Dephonians were still suppressed and unrecognized by the ruling Orders.
The Dephonians began rioting, and a civil war broke out between the
Dephonians and the Tritheonians. The majority of the populace, not
members of any Orders, worked to death by the Tritheonian Council and
now living in fear of the war, begged the Pantheon and the Tritheon,
through Zima, to put a stop to their misery.
 
In the Thirty Seventh Year AT, the Tritheon was allowed to return to
help stop the war. They deposed the Tritheonian council and replaced
it with a king. Tritheonopolis was now a Monarchy.
