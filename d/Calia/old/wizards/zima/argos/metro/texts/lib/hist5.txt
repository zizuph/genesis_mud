BOOK V - The History of Argos
THE REIGN OF PAXEUS (40-64 AT)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The expulsion of the Dephonians and the coronation of Paxeus, the second
ruler of Argos, initiated an era of peace and growth for the Argosians.
Paxeus, later called somewhat weak by historians, made a treaty with the
Dephonians allowing them to live in peace away from Argos in the dark forest,
though many warned of them gaining strength and one day becoming a menace
again. The Treaty of the Dark Woods was signed in the Forty Second year,
after a few skirmishes between Argosian guards and Dephonians in the woods.
 
Paxeus also reorganized the Tritheonian Council as an advisory council to
the King. Though this council had no true authority, it did wield
significant political power in the years to come.
 
Believing the King should live at least as well as those of the Orders
who lived in the immaculate marble temples (the rest of the populace
still lived in tents), Paxeus spent most of his life supervising the
construction of a palace from which he and his descendents since have
ruled. The palace was finished in the year Fifty Eight AT after twelve
years of construction. Paxeus' building of the temple set a precedent
for future rulers of Argos, that they leave some monument to their
reign. Paxeus died in his sleep on the year Sixty Four AT.
