And behold did a fifth Angel of the Light of Darkness appear, and
in her eyes burned the fires of the offerings to Our Mother.
Trumpets sounded from the billowing darkness, and the Angel did say,
'Praised be Our Mother who brings the Light of Darkness!'
 
And then did the Angel raise her hands to the sky, and said 'Place
thy gift upon that which is consecrated, for thy offering is
pleasing to Our Mother!' And I did place that which was shrouded
in the robe of the mountain tops upon the Consecrated, and the Angel
did shout praise and glory to Our Mother.
 
And then did the Angel gaze into my eyes, and I was filled with fear
and hope, and then did the Angel say, 'Chant praise unto the Light
of Darkness and to Our Mother who brings it, and the Light of
Darkness shall overshadow you, and you shall be greatly blessed!'
And I did as the Angel said, chanting praise unto the Light of
Darkness and to Our Mother who brings it, and a great fire came from
the heavens, and consumed all that had been consecrated, taking its
spirit as offering to Our Mother. And was I overcome with
a great spirit, and my mind was made clear, and I was filled with
the wisdom and Blessing of Our Mother. And the Angel was enveloped
by the billowing darkness.
