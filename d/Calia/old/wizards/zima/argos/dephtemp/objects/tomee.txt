And behold did a fourth Angel of the Light of Darkness appear, and
from her mouth ran the blood of the Innocent and in her hands she held
a holy vessel. Trumpets sounded from the billowing darkness, and the
Angel did say 'Praised be Our Mother who brings the Light of Darkness!'
 
And the Angel cried out with a great voice, and I was taken to the
consecrated place, and the Angel did give the holy vessel unto me, and
said 'Fill the vessel with the blood of the Innocent One, and drink of it,
for it shall be sweet nectar unto you. Drink thyself into ecstasy!'
 
And I did as the Angel said, and I filled the vessel with the blood of
the Innocent, and drank the nectar from the vessel; thrice I did this,
and I was overcome with a great power, and I did fall into ecstasy.
 
And when I had done this, the Angel shouted praise again and was enveloped
in the billowing clouds.
