And then did a second Angel of the Light of Darkness appear, and
upon her forehead where three crescents. Trumpets sounded from
the billowing darkness, and the Angel did say. 'Praised be Our
Mother who brings the Light of Darkness!'
 
And the Angel said unto me 'Kneel before the altar of supplication, and
pray for revelation, oh Chosen One of the Disciples, amidst the three
witnesses of the night, and great mysteries shall be revealed unto you!'
And I did kneel and pray for revelation, and I received the prophecies of
our Order, sights of our great history to come, to be ever memorialized
by our descendants, and with each sight I heard the incantations of the
spirits in the ancient language, and I remembered them all.
 
And then the Angel did say 'Make now thy prayer in honour of that which
you have seen, and thou shalt be blessed!' Having received the Revelations,
I did pray the invocations of glory, in the ancient words I received from
the spirits, the power of the fruit of the vine still coursing through my
veins, and behold, I received the blessing of wisdom, and the spirits
praised that which I had done. And the Angel was enveloped in the
billowing darkness.
