And then did a third Angel of the Light of Darkness appear, and upon
her hands was the blood of the Innocents. Trumpets sounded from
the billowing darkness, and the Angel did say, 'Praised by Our
Mother who brings the Light of Darkness!'
 
And the Angel took flight, and I was taken far away, to the land
where the Innocent roams, and behold the Innocent did appear,
shrouded in the robe of the mountain tops, the least of his kind.
 
And the angel did say 'Blessed is she who slays the Innocent in
the name of Our Mother, for she shall be highly favored forever!'
But the Innocent was garbed in holiness, so that no blade should
touch his skin.
 
And the angel did say, 'Who may slay the Innocent One? Surely none
but the one who posseses the blessed instrument of death!' And behold,
the holy weapon appeared in my hand, and its silver blade sparkled
in the moonlight, and its jewel glowed red with power.
 
And I did take the instrument, and slew the Innocent One, who was
overcome by the strength of the Light of Darkness. And the blood of
the Innocent One did fill the land, and all his kind did wail in
sorrow, and there was a great chant from the depths of Hades saying
'Joy Joy Joy, for the Innocent has been slain!' And the Angel
shouted praise to Our Mother, and I was taken with the remnants of
the Innocent into the dark clouds, and the Angel was enveloped in
their billowing darkness.
