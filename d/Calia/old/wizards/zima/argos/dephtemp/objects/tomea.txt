Glory unto the Light of Darkness, and to She Our Mother who brings it!
He who hath an ear, let him hear, and he who hath eyes, let him read,
for greatly blessed are those who know of the Vision which has been
brought unto me, Delphia, the Chosen One of Dephonia, she who was
first anointed with the Light of Darkness!
 
Behold, a sacred raven did appear unto me, and she said 'The
time has come for you, oh Chosen One of the Disciples, to see
what must come to pass!' And great dark clouds filled the sky,
lightning crashed down upon the land, and thunder shook the
earth, and I was taken into the dark clouds, and there I saw
the Vision.
 
And the Raven did say 'Thou shalt be adorned in glory for the
journey thou partake,' and then was I shrouded in Chosen Darkness,
the face of the Prophet upon my breast, my heart encircled with
twelve stars.
 
Then the Raven did say 'She who is shrouded in Chosen Darkness shall
receive the seal of Our Mother!' and then about my neck was placed
the golden seal of the one who honours the Light of Darkness.
