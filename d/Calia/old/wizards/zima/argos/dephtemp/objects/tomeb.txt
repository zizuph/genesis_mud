And then did an Angel of the Light of Darkness appear, and upon
her forehead was the Seal of the Hemlock Serpent, holding the
fruit of the vine in her hands.
 
Trumpets sounded from the billowing darkness, and the Angel did
say 'Praised be Our Mother who brings the Light of Darkness!' And
the Angel did give the fruit of the vine unto me, and I raised
my eyes unto her, and asked for her blessing upon it.
 
And the Angel did raise her voice in praise, and blessed the fruit
of the vine with her prayer, and did say 'Drink now of this cup,
and you shall be enlightened!'
 
And I did as the Angel said, and I drank the black blood of the fruit
of the vine, and I began to tremble in fear, for it had received the
blessing of the Angel of Death.
 
And the Angel did say 'Fear not, for thou art chosen, and thou
shalt not die!' And the Angel was enveloped in the billowing
darkness.
