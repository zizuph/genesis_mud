    
    A brief early history of the Colleges of Elemental Magic.
    by Appolonius, founder of the College of Fire Magic

    I write this to educate the reader on how the Colleges came into
being and how I discovered elemental magic. Rarely have I had the 
patience for writing extensively, but this story cannot be told fully 
by any other. Most of the history is known to the scholars currently 
working in the Tower, but this text is not intended chiefly for them 
- rather for new members coming here to study.

    For as long as I can remember I have been intrigued by the arcane
and the esoteric. At first I believed the key to mastering magic was
to develop an internal discipline and affect the world through sheer 
force of will. Many of you who read this have probably been down that
path also, and know as I now do that it leads only to frustration and 
little more power than that of a stage magician. My lack of progress
along this line of research led me to study others I knew of who were
able to do magic, albeit in a limited fashion - the Elemental 
Worshippers of Calia.

    As the reader is probably aware, their magic is based on the
summoning of minor elemental spirits and channeling power from other,
more powerful elemental spirits. Call them gods if you will, I find 
worship of them distasteful and pointless. Other ways are more 
rewarding, but I am getting ahead of myself. While the Worshippers
themselves got their powers from elementals, it seemed logical that
the elementals themselves would get their powers from somewhere. If
they got their powers from other masters, then in turn these masters
should get their powers from somewhere, until someone, at the end of
this chain, must be able to move the primal forces of the universe of
their own ability. It was this power I was looking for. 

    I went about learning more by devising my own rituals to summon 
elemental spirits, partly drawing from observation of Worshippers 
working their craft. My first tentative efforts here earned me a few 
scars, but in the end I learned to draw wards to keep the spirits 
contained. Elemental beings from all four elements I did summon, but
I had no command over them, and all of my efforts to establish 
communication were in vain. Likely I would not have gotten anywhere
if a particularly curious and wise fire spirit hadn't taken a liking
to me and communicated. 

    The language of this communication should be familiar to those of
you who are learning fire magic. It was a language of raw emotion, of
rage, of passion and violence. I had always grappled with feelings
of that nature, because of a sense that they conflicted with my
academic pursuits. One is taught after all, that detached analysis is
the way to approach scholastic endeavours, and I had always thought
magic could be approached the same way. What I learnt though was 
that only by embracing those feelings could I hope to touch the 
source of power. Tapping into that part of myself, I was able to 
respond and converse with the fire spirit.  Many revelations 
followed, but I must admit it took a long time before I learned any 
sort of control. This paradox should be no stranger to you; to tap 
into elemental power one must give in to the part of oneself that is 
close to the element, yet without control, it is impossible to focus 
the element into concrete spells.

    Try as I might, there was no way for me to use any other element
than fire. This led me to a theory, which now has become proven fact: 
none can touch more than one elemental plane. Later, as I was trying
to build an academy for the purpose of studying elemental magic in 
a more organised fashion, I would learn that few are even able to
learn the use of one element. More balanced personality types, who
have no strong leanings to the extremes of the elementals, just have
no ability as far as elemental magic is concerned. Much time passed
as I chaired the first Assembly and we all strove to understand the
depths of the elemental craft. We discovered that we could, not 
without difficulty, cooperate and weave more complex spells together,
but this is a subject for a different book entirely.

    Bringing us up to the current date. The Marble Tower has just
recently been raised, new students have joined us, and I along with
the other founders are kept busy imparting our knowledge to a new
generation. Soon I will be dust, but I believe the foundation we have
laid here will endure throughout the ages.
