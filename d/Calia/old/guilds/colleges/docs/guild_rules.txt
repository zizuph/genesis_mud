    The rules of the Colleges of Elemental Magic
    by Draughan, founder of the College of Water Magic


    Conduct:

    �1: The inner workings of the guild shall not be revealed to 
outsiders, nor specifics about our capabilities or training.
    �2: Working magic around non-trusted outsiders should only be 
done in a discreet manner or not at all. The exception to this is 
self-defence, when appropriate and decisive force may be employed 
without concern for appearances.
    �3: All members are to treat each other with the respect and 
courtesy due a fellow scholar. This entails, of course, that no 
member shall attack another. Any good scholar must be able to set 
aside personal differences and work with others, and be able to keep 
an open and clear mind. This does not mean that everyone has to be 
friends or even like each other.
    �4: No member shall join any guild or group that engage in 
worship, and no oath nor fealty shall be sworn that may result in 
coming into conflict with other guild members.
    �5: Members are free to pursue their enemies or otherwise meddle 
in the world as long as their activity does not put the guild in a 
bad light or draws unnecessary attention to us. This does not hold
for apprentices, who must prove themselves and become full mages
before being allowed such freedom.

    Politics:

    �6: The Colleges of Elemental Magic are independent, and will not 
form alliances with other organisations. Cooperation on a guild basis
is limited to the mutual exchange of non-vital knowledge.
    �7: The word of the Assembly is the law of the guild, but the 
Assembly will only convene to rule on matters concerning the guild as
a whole.
    �8: The internal affairs and daily running of each College is left 
to the Principal of that College, whose authority binds its members. 
Should a Principal step down or be cast out by the Assembly, they are
responsible for electing a new one.
    �9: The Chairman of the Assembly casts the tiebreaking vote.
    �10: The guild will never participate in wars or initiate large-
scale conflict. However, should any members be unduly persecuted then
the Assembly may call upon senior members to strike back in an 
organized fashion.
        
    Apprentices/advancement:

    �11: The guild does not accept applications for membership. 
Instead, people who are deemed to have both the gift for elemental 
magic and the necessary academic disposition will be approached by 
members of the guild for apprenticeship.
    �12: Apprentices may be taken by anyone of Scholar level, and are
all subject to approval by the Principal of that College. A poor
apprentice may compromise the whole guild, therefore the Principal 
must confer with the rest of the Assembly to see if there are any 
issues with the potential apprentice.
    �13: Apprentices advance to mage status at the discretion of the 
Principal of the College and the mentor. Further advancement within 
the guild is at the discretion of the Principal alone.
    �14: Apprentices defer to all full members of the guild, and are
expected to obey if doing so does not conflict with instructions 
from their mentor or the Principal.
