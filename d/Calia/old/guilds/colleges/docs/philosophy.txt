  
    A philosophy of balance,
    by Nirondar, Illuminate of Earth

    This document is written upon the request of the Assembly.

    When Appolonius founded our guild and called the first Assembly,
it was thought unnecessary to develop a philosphy to which our 
members must adhere. In the manner of traditional institutions of 
education, the Colleges taught and cared little for the behaviour of
the students outside the Marble Tower, as long as the they held their
tongues about our affairs and did not embarrass us. For a time, this
was enough. Elemental magic wielded by a master can be a powerful
instrument of change, and while the founders were more interested in
the craft itself than influencing the world, not all subsequent 
members were as detached. Some used what they learnt here to become 
champions of good or evil on distant shores. Eventually the Assembly
decided that the Colleges could not let their members loose into the
world unchecked; that there needed to be firm guidelines upon the use
of their powers. It was clear that they needed to develop a charter
that allowed the members some freedom to use their magic out in the
world, yet restricted them and bound the guild together in a joint
purpose. 

    An old proposal was dusted off; it was put forward many years ago
by Draughan, the first Principal of the College of Water Magic, but 
then rejected by the Assembly. He had wanted the Colleges to take the
step from being mere places of learning to fully-fledged occupational
guilds that accept a higher degree of responsibility for the actions 
of their members. As part of this he proposed that the goals of the 
guild be twofold: in addition to study and mastery of elemental 
magic, he put forward that the Colleges should work as a force of 
balance in the Realms. What then is balance? Cultures, ideas and
species clash constantly. For every new thing that springs to life, 
much from the past fades into oblivion. This not only leads to the
world becoming gradually less diverse and interesting, it also means
that history, instead of being a gradual ascent into enlightenment, 
becomes a cycle of old mistakes repeated. Draughan envisioned the 
Colleges as a society of learned fellows, who not only used their 
knowledge to counsel and guide the living, but also had the strength 
to arrest chaotic forces that stamp out unique things.

    -Violence must be tempered with acumen. There are times when a
better order can only arise from the ashes of the old, but 
destruction wielded wantonly and without insight results in a poorer
world. Education and subtle guidance are often better instruments 
for change.
    -There are times when important things lose footing in the world
and are destroyed in spite of our best efforts. In such cases it is
vital that we chronicle their fall so that future students may learn.
    -Good and evil may be useful tools for simple folk to make sense
of the world around them, but we must hold a more nuanced view. 
Sometimes, "evil" is defeated and the world is worse off for it.
    -There is nothing automatic about the advancement of knowledge
and understanding in the world over time. Predicting exactly how
things will turn out if you interfere is difficult, but that is no
excuse not to try.
    -Finally, while students are encouraged to exert influence as
indicated above, all such work is done on an individual basis. The
guild as a whole will not involve itself, we risk too much if we are
drawn into open conflict.

    This may all sound rather nebulous for the practical-minded
student. Fortunately though, there exists no requirement that you
adopt or even understand these ideas. If you so choose you may spend
most of your time in the Marble Tower, studying and perfecting your
art, travelling outside only on peaceful errands. Should you however
decide that you want to use your abilities to effect change in the 
outside world, the preceding principles must be your guidestone. 
Consider this an amendment to �5 in the guild rules.
