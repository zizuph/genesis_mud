This is a tentative tax document for the Elemental Worshippers of Calia.
The old tax doc is at ~Calia/worshippers/tax_doc. The changes from the
old guild include new spells coded to the standard of ~Genesis/newmagic,
and slightly revised skill list now including a couple of new form skills
and reduction in defence skill training.

Spell Tax:

Guidelines are rather loose so this will be a guesstimate. The exact 
descriptions of the spells are in ~Calia/newworshippers/docs, with
components, mana cost, location of code and any special requirements.

I'll just go through spell by spell with quick recap of the spell 
effect (see spell doc for exact formulas/effects) with tax estimate.

Utility spells available to all guild members (2):

ANEMOS: Tax for this member-to-member tell spell used to be 4%, but
if my information is correct it can now be classified as a type 1
spell with tax of 0.25%.

APODOSI: This spell returns the caster to the Worshipper temple. It
has significant restrictions: long casting time, no combat use, 
precious component (gem that has a 15% chance of being consumed in
casting). It is still a class 3 spell probably, I suggest 1% tax.

Elemental summoning spells (4):

The only significant ability of the elementals (they're mainly
roleplaying tools) is the ability they have to turn into a damage
shield for the caster. The damage shields for each element work
differently, but they're still all rather similar in effect. So
while all the elemental summoning spells (STOUS, KATARAKTAS,
PSOTIA and CHOMA) could be classified as class 3 spells and thus
being worth 4% tax all told, I feel that should be reduced to 3% due 
to their essential similarity. 

Special spells for each element (4):

These four spells, one for each element, are only available to the 
followers of each respective elemental god. So no Worshipper will 
have access to more than one of these spells. A design goal therefore
is that each of them should be worth the same amount of tax, so 
everyone in the guild pays the same tax. 

They're at the upper boundary probably of what can be considered 
permissible in terms of power level for a layman guild spell. The 
tax documentation doesn't seem to allow for more than 1% tax per 
spell in a layman guild, but I think these are worth 2% each.

EVIMERO: Haste spell affecting self, 40-100 LIVE_I_QUICKNESS bonus.
DYNAMI: STR, CON and DIS boost affecting self, 10-30% bonus to stats.
FLOGA: Bolt spell with pen from 250-450.
ALEIPSO: Healing spell with heal amount of 200-400.

So, tax summary:

Skill tax:               5.58%
Anemos spell:            0.25%
Apodosi spell:           1.00%
Summoning spells:        3.00%
Special spell:           2.00%
----------------------------- 
Total:                  11.83% ~= 12%.
