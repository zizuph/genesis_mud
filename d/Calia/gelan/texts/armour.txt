I make armours of the type, metals, and constructions listed below.
My steel armour is of the highest standard that is sold in Genesis.
To order an item, use the command "aorder" followed by the type,
metal and construction. Here are some possible examples:

    "aorder shield steel tower"
or 
    "aorder helm bronze great"   
or
    "aorder body-armour iron plate"

Here are the possible types, metals and constructions:

Types:
  shield, body-armour, helm, greaves, bracers. 

Metals (in order of armour quality, top to bottom):
  steel, gold, silver, iron, bronze, brass.

Constructions (I currently only make the optimum in each class):
  For shields: tower.
  For greaves, body-armour and bracers: plate.
  For helms: great.
