I make polearms of the types, metals, lengths and decorations listed below.
To order an item, use the command "porder" followed by the type, metal,
length and decoration. Here are some possible examples: 

    "porder halberd silver medium fiery"
or 
    "porder fauchard steel long runed"
or
    "porder trident bronze short sleek"


Here are the possible types, metals, lengths and decorations: 

Weapon types (all have equal effectiveness):
halberd, fauchard, trident 

Metals (from best down for quality of weapon):
steel, silver, bronze

Lengths (the longer the more effective, though the short polearms 
         are the only ones that may be wielded in one hand) :
long, medium, short

Decorations (on the haft, purely decorative):
fiery, sleek, runed
