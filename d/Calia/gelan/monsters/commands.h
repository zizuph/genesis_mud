    "sizzle, sizzle, he got very hot-headed.  He ran to " +
    "the fountain and saved what he could.  The next " +

    "messy and painful.  What's more, the less cautious " +
    "among them turned up with no hair at all and a " +
    "burnt scalp.  So Bobby-Pin Angora invented the " +

    "had nothing whatsever to do with magic and they " +

    "and tied to a large tree.  (For lack of a jail...) " +
    "But when a jail was built, the tree lost its job. " +
    "(Sob, sob...) Unfortunately, the citizens of Gelan " +
    "had not only lost a powerful deterrent but also a " +
    "very amusing pastime: They used to gather around " +
    "the mighty tree and express their concern for the " +
    "poor sods.  So...  without further ado they went " +
    "on to something completely different: A pillory! " +
    "They took the remains of the giant tree (that had " +
    "been felled by the guards in order to have enough " +
    "space for the new jail) and erected a giant " +
    "pillory.  Peace (er...  mayhem) was restored.  By " +
    "the way, the unwritten law was: No objects harder " +
