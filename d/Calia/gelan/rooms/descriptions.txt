road - inside town 
    add_item(({"road","floor","ground"}), BS("The road consists of white " 
          + "marble. It is shining white, but despite its look, its not "

gate - from the south 
    add_item("gate",BS("It is huge, even from this distance. In front of "

gate - south near 
    add_item("gate", BS("The gate is impressive. Not only it's height but "
