1. General

* The village is built into the trees, and consists of several layers, 
the forest floor and one or more levels of platforms and walkways in 
the trees. 

* It is laidd out in a rough ring shape around an exceptionally
large and ancient oak in the center which has special significance
to the inhabitants.

* The common name of the village refers to the large numbers of toads that
live in and around the Great Oak

* A stream flows through the village from a spring on a nearby hill. The 
stream forms a small waterfall and a pool at the bottom of the hill that is
used for bathing. There is also a small pond beneath the village that is home
to ducks and other animals.

* The homes, walkways, and other structures of the village are not built in 
the trees, but are part of the trees themselves, which are encouraged to grow 
into the desired shapes without being harmed.  

* There are often animals of various types wandering through the village. As
long as they don't harm anyone (and preferably not each other much) they are
left alone. 

2. People

* The elves of TiO are generally peaceful, fun-loving, and carefree. They 
enjoy flowers, music, art, swimming in the pool, and just about anything 
that isn't hard work.  

* They try to live in harmony with nature as much as possible, and don't hurt
any person, plant, or animal unless necessary. They are not absolute 
vegetarians but very little meat is served in the village. 

* The elves have the ability to magically shape wood without harming the 
plant it comes from. Some or more talented than others, with only a very few
able to create the structures of the village itself. The ability works best
with the oaks around the village, and may not work at all without Calian wood
that has soaked up ethereals. 

* The elves don't like to fight, but will defend themselves and their village
when needed. If somebody in the village is attacked anybody close by will 
likely rush to their defence. In some cases certain people might come no 
matter how far away they are. (Doe and Allerdice especially)

* Money is not exchanged among the villagers at all. Recently they have 
recognized it's usefullness in dealing with outsiders, and offer a few 
products and services in exchange for coin.

* Lizards?
* Song birds
* Butterflies for the gardens. 

5. NPC's 

* Doe and Allerdice need to be included somewhere in the village.

* Commercial ventures like a store and inn may be be run by the siblings 
Nahasa, Peema, and Petilon. 

6. Code concerns

* I orignally wanted NPC's to act in very complicated ways. This will 
probably be toned down somewhat, at least at first. I'd still like to have
them react to each other and their surroundings in certain ways, but only
if it can be done without coding complex AI's for them. 

* Other complicated things I wanted to do are going to have to be toned down 
as well. The mushrooms and vegetable garden are gone completely, and the 
flower garden will be simplified.
