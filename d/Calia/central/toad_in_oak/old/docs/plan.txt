General
-------

1.  The village consists of four levels.    
    1.1 The forest floor. 
    1.2 Three layers of interconnected "buildings in the branches of 
        the trees. 
        1.2.1   The lower level contains most public places. 
        1.2.2   The upper two levels contain mostly homes

2.  The village is laid out in a rough ring shape.
    2.1 There is a exceptionally large and ancient oak in the center 
        2.1.1   The Great Oak is of great significance to the 
                inhabitants
        2.1.2   The oak has been the home for a number of toads for 
                centuries. 
                2.1.2.1 This is the origin of the villages current name
                2.1.2.2 The toads resist any effort to remove them.

3.  A stream flows through the village, originating from a spring on a
    nearby hill.
    3.1 At the bottom of the hill the stream forms a small waterfall
        with a pool at the bottom. 
        3.1.1   This pool is used for bathing by the inhabitants. 
    3.2 A simple plumbing system is used to carry water from the stream
        directly to the lower level of the village. (This is mostly for
        convienience, not cleanliness. Water directly from the stream
        below is quite drinkable.)
    3.3 The stream forms a small pond directly below the village which 
        is occupied by frogs, toads, and ducks. 

4.  The people of Toad-in-Oak attempt to live in harmony with nature
    4.1 Animals are free to live in, or pass through the village, as long
        as they do not disturb the peace. 
    4.2 The people will not intentionally harm any plant. 
        4.2.1 Homes, furniture, and other items are created by a mystical
              art which can change the shape of a tree without harming it. 

People
------

5.  The elves of Toad-in-Oak are extremely long lived. 
    5.1 They do not age significantly. (All NPC's will appear young 
        unless there's good reason for an exception.)
    5.2 They don't die of natural causes. Eventually the will feel an
        irresistable urge to travel somewhere. (No graveyard)
        5.2.1   This is known as the Parting.
                5.2.1.1 Nobody can follow, but couples may Part together
                5.2.1.2 The people avoid speaking the names of the parted. 
        5.2.2   They can be killed, and if so, are buried beneath the 
                Great Oak.

6.  Physical stuff:
    6.1 Elves are shorter and lighter than most humans
    6.2 They have delicate features and pointed ears that make them 
        beautiful to most other race. (NPCs will be pretty/pleasant 
        or above.) 
    6.3 Three varieties of coloring
        6.3.1   Blonde thru Brown hair, blue eyes. (Most common)
        6.3.2   Black hair, green eyes. (25% or so)
        6.3.3   Red hair, green eyes (very rare)
        6.3.4   Some older elves nearing their Parting may have some 
                grey or white hair. 

7.  The people of Toad-in-Oak have the ability to shape trees without
    doing harm. 
    7.1 I need a good name for this ability. This is inspired by 
        Robert Jordans Ogier tree-singers, but I'd like a different 
        name
    7.2 The ability varies in strength from person to person. 
        7.2.1   Most can do very little
        7.2.2   A small number of people have enough talent to 
                achieve useful results, such as:
                7.2.2.1 Causing the tree to grow in a different 
                        direction. 
                7.2.2.2 Creating shelves, niches, steps and so on. 
                7.2.2.3 creating simple objects such as staves,
                        bowls, simple furniture, etc. 
                7.2.2.4 Combining with others of similar talent to 
                        create rooms in trees, walkways and so on.
        7.2.3   A very few people have exceptional talent. They can
                do great feats such as:
                7.2.3.1 Causing a tree's growth to speed up or slow
                        down. 
                7.2.3.2 Creating rooms and paths single handedly 
                7.2.3.3 Creating complex objects, such as sculpture,
                        or even sharpened wooden swords. 

Society 
------- 

8.  Toad-in-Oak is a pseudo-communist society. 
    8.1 People cooperate for the benefit of the village, doing various
        tasks such as food gathering, defending the village, and the
        creation and maintenance of the homes and paths of the 
        village. 
        
    8.2 Village leadership is minimal. Important decisions are made
        by those considered the wisest. 
        8.2.1   Major tasks are organized under a leader.
                8.2.1.1 The defense of the village is under Doe.
                8.2.1.2 The Tree-shapers are lead by Allerdice
    8.3 Before the time of Kroug, the elves didn't use money at all, 
        as everything was shared recently. They have no recognized 
        that money is useful in dealing with outsdiders, and will 
        exchange some goods and services for coin.
        8.3.1   Basic training is available.
        8.3.2   Food and drink can be purchased.
        8.3.3   Beds can be rented for a night. 
        8.3.4   Some trained pets and wooden things are available
        8.3.5   The ambitious siblings Nahasa, Peema, and Petilon 
                have opened a general store. 
                8.3.5.1 They have hired a gnome as a money-changer. 
    8.4 Everyone in the village is treated equally, regardless of age
        or gender. 
        8.4.1   People may work at more than one job. Allerdice 
                helps with the defence of the village as well as his
                "tree-singing", and Doe has been known to attempt to 
                cook on occasion. 

9.  The people of Toad-in-Oak have a simple religion that revolves 
    nature, the Great Oak, and the Parting. 
    9.1 There are no priests or services. 
    9.2 People pray to nature facing it's greatest representative,
        the Great Oak, generally at the base of the tree itself. 
    9.3 They believe that when a person Parts, their destination is 
        a land with an entire forest of trees on the scale of the 
        Great Oak.
    9.4 They believe that a person can be reincarnated when they 
        become bored with the "afterlife", as an elf, or as another
        creature. 
        9.4.1   This is why they will not harm animals unless 
                necessary
        9.4.2   Some people believe that that a persons hair colour
                indicates the souls "experience". Black hair is a 
                new soul, and the lighter the colour the more times
                they've been reincarnated. The occasional redheads 
                make this seem unlikely though. 

10. The people of Toad-in-Oak are generally fun-loving and they will 
    work hard so they will have more free time to enjoy themselves. 
    10.1    One favorite passtime is swimming in the pool below the spring.
    10.2    Music and art are popular.

11. The warriors of the village are the Defenders of the Oak. 
    11.1    This is of course the race guild that will exist here 
            someday. 
            11.1.1 I need a more elvish name for this group.           
    11.2    The group has existed for all of the villages history, 
            but has not been very active until the Kroug invasion
    11.3    The group was founded to defend Toad-in-Oak, but they 
            vow to defend elves everywhere if possible. 
    11.4    There is some disagreement as to how to best achieve 
            their goals. 
            11.4.1  The majority simply want to defend the village
                    from attack.
            11.4.2  A few wish to prevent any attack by striking 
                    first. Nobody has ever managed to organize any
                    serious support for this idea.
