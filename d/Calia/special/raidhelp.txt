Palace Raid Command Descriptions:
--------------------------------- 
warriors -   lists Calian mortals in the game. 

raidtest -   gathers together the krougs in the foothills into waiting rooms 
             for a raid. This is the first command that should be used when 
             you want to start a raid. 

raidstr  -   sets the strength for a raid, i.e. the number of krougs that
             will be involved in it. This must be less than or equal to 
             the maximum kroug strength given to you by <raidtest>. 

raidgroup -  sets the number of groups of krougs that there will be  
             in the raid. Choose a smaller number of groups if you want 
             to give more of a challenge. 

raidwarn  -  sets the length of the warning period for the raid in minutes.   

raidwhere -  lists where players and krougs are during a raid, if they are 
             in the palace or crystalline road vicinity. 

raidscore -  lists the current kill tallies of kroug slayers, i.e. how 
             many of each type of kroug they have killed. 

terminate -  terminates a raid. This can be done at any stage of an active 
             raid (even while testing) if something goes wrong. It will get 
             rid of the active krougs in stages. 

raidreset -  after a raid has finished you need to use this command 
             to reset all the raid variables.
