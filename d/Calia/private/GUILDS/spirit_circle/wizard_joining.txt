To join the guild (as a wizard), teleport to:

/d/Calia/guilds/scop/temple/joinroom.c

and type 'pray to Psuchae'

You cannot have any occupational guilds and the only layman guild you
can be in is the Elemental Worshippers. Once everything has completed,
you will be a member of the guild and appear in the garden. Go east, 
east, wash myself, enter temple. That will get you in the temple and
you can wander from there. To get more spells, you need to go to the
divination chamber and 'enter first circle', then 'divine for gifts'.
This will give you all of the level one spells.
