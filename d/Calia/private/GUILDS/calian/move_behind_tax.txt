
Combat aid for move behind and mbsw
===================================

Move behind is a skill that allows a player, when in a team 
and being attacked by an opponent or opponents, to move behind 
a team-mate who then faces the opponent(s) attacks. Likelihood 
of success depends on the dex of the strongest enemy, the wisdom 
of the attacker, the number of enemies, the dex and wisdom of 
the Calian and his/her move behind skill, and the strength and 
discipline of his/her team-mate. For the exact calculation
please refer to the code. There is a short reset time of one 
second. As a measure to stop enemy players from preventing 
Calians from swarming at all by typing "kill" repeatedly, a 
short period of protection from attack is introduced after 
moving behind. It is long enough for one swarm preparation 
time plus a couple of seconds to spare. After successfully 
moving behind one may not move behind again until a period 
as long as a complete swarm cycle (prepare and recover). This 
is to prevent an "invulnerability" problem with repeated 
moving behind. Additionally, after someone has moved behind 
a fellow Calian, that Calian may not use the skill until a 
period equalling one-and-a-half times a complete swarm cycle 
has elapsed. This is to prevent the tactic known as "spiralling", 
where two or more Calians swarm then move behind immediately 
in turn, which allows a much higher rate of swarming than 
allowed for in the tax. It is difficult to estimate the 
combat aid for move behind. Without this feature, a Calian 
who swarms would find it very awkward to work well in a team. 
It does have a number of drawbacks as listed above, and its 
own skill. The skill is essential in player fights, important 
against smarter npcs, and is useful in other cases as an 
alternative to leaving and returning especially in dangerous 
areas. 

There is a special move that Calians can do called "mbsw", 
which is simply a move behind followed by an immediate swarm 
attempt (with the usual preparation time). Without it, a Calian 
involved in a player fight who doesn't have a fast link might 
never be able to swarm. 

Together, move behind and mbsw are estimated to give a combat 
aid of 10%.
