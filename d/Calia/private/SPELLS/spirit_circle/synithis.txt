Synithis -         This spell will summon a familar that the guild
                   member will be able to speak through, since guild
                   members won't be able to talk normally at all (when
                   they join the guild, they have their tongues 
                   magically removed).
                   The familiar cannot carry things, nor can it attack
                   for the caster or take hits. It will not initiate
                   combat. It can be cast in combat. Requires a rib and
                   intestines. 20 mana. Lasts until the caster runs
                   out of mana (taking 25 mana every time limit). This 
                   spell is available to all guild members.
