Shadow Form -      This spell will turn the caster into a shadowy form.
                   This form will conceal their identities (unless
                   they introduce themselves again) until which time
                   they either run out of mana or dispel the effects.
                   It continuously takes mana from the player to
                   remain in this form. Players can attack and be
                   attacked as normal in this form (they do not get
                   any special abilities other than emotes). This spell
                   cannot be cast in combat and will not initiate
                   combat. Requires a pre-made component (can only be
                   created in the guildhome) consisting of amber and
                   cranberry. 100 mana. Lasts until the caster runs
                   out of mana (taking 25 mana every 100 seconds).
                   This spell is available to all level 3 and higher
                   guild members.
