True Identity -    This will reveal the name of the target. It will only
                   work on other players, NOT npcs. This spell will then
                   allow the caster to remember that player as if they
                   had been introduced to them (if they have enough slots
                   in their memory to do so). The caster will have to
                   manually remember the target. This spell will not
                   start combat and cannot be cast during combat.
                   Requires a black diamond. 100 mana. This spell is only
                   available to level 7 members (Master) and above.
                   NOTE: This spell will leave the caster paralyzed for
                         30 + random(60) seconds as well.
