                                    Welcome!

        Are you looking for a domain based on a great book? If you are,
      you've come to the wrong place! Here in Calia we do things the other
       way around. The book is a work in progress based on what's already
        been created and is planned for the domain. The text is far from
       complete, and the parts that exist are still only in outline form,
       but you are welcome to read it and post any comments on the board.

         The command "wizards" will list the current wizards of Calia.
     The command "projects <domain/wizard>" will list the current projects
                       of the specified domain or wizard.

                       Uhclem von Sprocket, Lord of Calia
