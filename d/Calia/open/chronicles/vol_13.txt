                    Volume 13:  Annals of the Guild, Part II

    13.1 The Crux was the sole large gap in the mountains, and both armies
    fortified their sides of the passage to prevent infiltration.

    13.2 Caliana assigned Oslewt the task of establishing observation posts on
    the mountains.

    13.3 Sharp-eyed dwarves made up the bulk of the observers.

    13.4 Those with the best ability to project their thoughts were chosen for
    observer duty.

    13.5 Unknown to them, Kroug had turned his attention to new forms of magic.

        13.5.1 He developed the Sword of Darkness which cast an enveloping
        shadow over an entire company of his troops, allowing them to travel
        unseen.

        13.5.2 By use of this cover, Kroug's troops were able to establish a
        large covert presence on Caliana's side of the mountains.

    13.6 Eventually, Kroug himself made his way through the Crux.

        13.6.1 He rested after making the journey, preparing for the casting of
        a tremendous spell.

        13.6.2 His plan was to draw a large number of Caliana's troops into a
        battle near the Crux.

        13.6.3 By confining them into this tight area, he would have them close
        enough to cast the spell of influence over all of them at once.

    13.7 The plan might have worked if it were not for the fortuitous arrival
    of Odium.

        13.7.1 Whether by mistake or by suggestion, Odium departed from the
        main road while leading a supply convoy to the mountain outposts.

        13.7.2 He found his party enveloped in darkness, but rather than
        retreat, he spurred his goblin cohorts to plunge forward.

        13.7.3 Odium and his companions stumbled headlong into Kroug himself.

    13.8 The battle began with neither side well deployed.

        13.8.1 Kroug's army was half on one side of the Crux, half on the
        other.

        13.8.2 In anticipation of engaging the enemy later, Kroug had kept his
        best officers on the far side of the mountains where they could prepare
        battle plans in security.

    13.9 Caliana's forces were dispersed into scouting parties, border guards,
    supply convoys, and training formations.

        13.9.1 Marrock and Hurn both had well-armed teams near the mountains,
        but they were some distance from the Crux in opposite directions.

        13.9.2 Krom had the largest company ready for combat, but they were
        engaged in training near the palace.

        13.9.3 Oslewt and several subordinate officers had companies of
        observers in the mountains.

        13.9.4 The other officers had been attending to other Guild business
        and had to assemble their forces for the attack.

        13.9.5 Caliana, in the palace, assembled a party of well-armed elite
        guards.

    13.10 With Kroug's infiltration exposed, both sides raced to make the most
    of their sudden encounter.

        13.10.1 Kroug was unwilling to waste his spellcasting power on Odium's
        small company, so the forces engaged on equal terms.

        13.10.2 Kroug's ordered his forces on the far side of the mountains,
        led by Steerax, to begin making their way through the Crux to reinforce
        the forward party.

        13.10.3 Krom, Marrock, and Hurn led their companies toward the Crux to
        meet the invaders.

        13.10.4 At Hurn's bidding, Caliana remained on Mt. Kyrus to coordinate
        the battle.

    13.11 Steerax's and Odium's forces struggled at the entrance to the Crux.

        13.11.1 Odium, in mental contact with Caliana, had been instructed to
        hold the entrance as long as possible, and the narrow space from which
        his soldiers could emerge made it impossible for Steerax to make
        effective use of his vast numeric superiority.

        13.11.2 Heaps of kroug bodies littered the ground, but eventually the
        unending supply of replacements wore Odium's company down, and they
        were pushed away from the mountain.

        13.11.3 Odium's company retreated in a orderly fashion, hoping to delay
        the enemy long enough to join with the advancing reinforcements.

    13.12 Caliana, divining the number of krougs massing for a surge through
    the Crux, ordered Odium to turn in a mock flanking maneuver, let his team
    be trapped against the mountains, and then be driven into the Crux.

        13.12.1 Paradoxically, the turn seemed to play into both Kroug's and
        Caliana's hands.

        13.12.2 The krougs on the northern side of the Crux rushed forward at
        the sight of the Odium's maneuver just as Steerax's column was about to
        deploy, and they drove the intertwined forces back into the narrow
        passage.

        13.12.3 The two halves of Kroug's army prevented each other from
        passing though the Crux, ensuring that his forces would remain split in
        half.

        13.12.4 Odium's convoy was surrounded with little hope of survival.

        13.12.5 The approach of the three companies led by Krom, Hurn, and
        Marrock threatened to surround the enemy, yet it would also place many
        Calians all within the compass of Kroug's spells.

    13.13 Kroug withdrew from the battle in preparation to cast the great
    spell.

        13.13.1 A small but elite unit ringed him to prevent disturbance during
        the complex task of casting the spell on the enemy forces.

        13.13.2 Kroug waited for his enemies to arrive at the optimum distance,
        where he could cast on the greatest number before they did significant
        damage to his own troops.

    13.14 Caliana, observing all with her own magic, sensed the impending doom
    of her own forces and commanded a desperate strategy.

        13.14.1 Hurn, Krom, and Marrock would strike an off-center blow on
        Kroug's flank, inflicting much damage but keeping their distance from
        Kroug himself and the Crux.

        13.14.2 Oslewt's forces would abandon their observation posts and
        descend straight down the mountainside onto Kroug's position.

        13.14.3 Only surprise would give Oslewt an opportunity to upset Kroug's
        preparations.

        13.14.4 There would be no chance for any rescue of Odium; his small
        force would have to defend the Crux to the death so that Kroug's
        reserves could not enter the fray.

    13.15 Oslewt's team descended the mountain quickly, so quickly that a few
    were killed by falling.

        13.15.1 Kroug, intent on gauging the advance of the forces approaching
        from the north, did not sense their approach until they were nearly
        upon him.

        13.15.2 Oslewt herself split the ring of guards, forcing Kroug to
        defend himself with his magic.

        13.15.3 Kroug conjured a whirlwind that hurled Oslewt's team back
        against the mountainside, killing and injuring many of them.

        13.15.4 Oslewt had fulfilled her role - having used a powerful spell
        already, Kroug was no longer in condition to possess a large number of
        Caliana's troops.

    13.16 His initial objective foiled, Kroug turned his attention to the Crux.

        13.16.1 With Odium's company drawing so many krougs directly to the
        narrow passage, Kroug's troops could neither retreat or organize an
        aggregate assault.

        13.16.2 Marrock and Hurn led the attack on Kroug's flank.

        13.16.3 Almost as soon as the krougs had reformed into a line to face
        their attackers, Krom drove his column headlong into them.

    13.17 With reinforcements on the march under Alamog and Elvira, Kroug
    realized that the Crux had to be opened or half his army would be
    decimated.

        13.17.1 The goblins led by Odium had wedged themselves into the
        tightest part of the Crux, where the lack of maneuvering room gave the
        superior Kroug forces little advantage.

        13.17.2 Kroug cast a spell, summoning forth lightning which repeatedly
        struck the goblins, killing a few and scattering the rest.

        13.17.3 Only Odium remained to block the passage, and the narrow space
        combined with his straight-ahead mauling expertise gave him every
        advantage.

        13.17.4 Steerax withdrew his troops and sent forth Humjob to deal with
        Odium.

        13.17.5 Hampered by the lack of space to swing his enormous weapon and
        repeatedly mauled by Odium, Humjob's inestimable constitution
        nonetheless prevailed, and Odium was cast in pieces upon the rocks.

    13.18 The Crux finally opened, Kroug's army streamed through, and the
    battle began to turn in his favor.

        13.18.1 Steerax led the reinforcements through the passage and
        assembled them into a formidable line alongside those commanded by
        Kroug.

        13.18.2 Kroug's forces advanced in a formation that stretched from
        horizon to horizon, with a tightly packed group led by Razmocudiac held
        in reserve.

        13.18.3 Caliana's forces fell back, retreating northwest toward Mt.
        Kyrus.

        13.18.4 Alamog's company assembled at the foot of the mountain, but
        they realized even from their distance that Kroug had a potentially
        devastating numeric advantage.

    13.19 Caliana cast four spells to buy time for her troops to redeploy in a
    desperate attempt to stop Kroug's advance.

        13.19.1 Kroug's troops suddenly became confused, each misunderstanding
        such simple things as his assigned place in line or the marching
        cadence.

        13.19.2 As the officers whipped the troops back into their formations,
        they began to jostle and push each other, every one trying to be at the
        front in pursuit of glory and loot.

        13.19.3 Some began to fall back as they shouted incoherently of seeing
        demons, their own deaths, or ghosts of fallen comrades.

        13.19.4 A few, weak-minded and prone to suggestion, confused their own
        troops with the enemy, and skirmishes broke out within Kroug's ranks.

    13.20 As the opposing armies moved into the foothills of Mt. Kyrus, a
    subtle shift in the battle occurred.

        13.20.1 Kroug's troops, while greater in number, had lost any semblance
        of coherent formation other than the group led by Razmocudiac, which
        retained its tight formation and concentrated on zig-zagging up the
        mountain to avoid contact with the Calians.

        13.20.2 Caliana's army had regrouped while in retreat.

        13.20.3 They also knew the foothills well, and could turn the
        intricacies of the terrain to their advantage.

        13.20.4 The battle broke into a series of skirmishes, with the Calians
        surrounding and decimating groups of krougs as they broke from their
        main force.

    13.21 Although their losses were heavy, the krougs made gradual progress up
    the mountain.

        13.21.1 The Calians fell back into an ever-tightening ring around the
        palace.

        13.21.2 Alamog's forces assembled at the base of the mountain and
        followed the krougs, tearing into them from behind.

    13.22 Kroug cast a great spell of darkness.

        13.22.1 The resulting chaos favored his side, which did not depend on
        formations and coordination as the Calians did, and the darkness gave
        Razmocudiac the opportunity to move his company up near the palace.

        13.22.2 The palace guards emerged with torches and lamps, but they were
        only partially successful in alleviating Kroug's advantage.

    13.23 Both sides continued taking heavy losses until the survivors were
    locked in a final struggle on the summit.

    13.24 The remainder of Oslewt's force reached the foothills, and the krougs
    found themselves fighting enemies above and below.

    13.25 The companies led by Oslewt and Alamog made slow but steady progress
    against the lower krougs, and Steerax divided his forces into two fronts.

        13.25.1 The krougs on the lower slopes fought a delaying action to slow
        the advance of the reinforcements.

        13.25.2 Razmocudiac's troops, who had thus far taken little damage,
        charged into the Calians atop the mountain with Humjob in the lead,
        tearing into the Calian line with his enormous spiked chain.

    13.26 Surrounded by krougs and losing mobility in their encirclement, the
    Calians on the upper plateau took refuge in the palace and locked the
    gates.

        13.26.1 The krougs were unable to gain entry to the palace.

        13.26.2 Razmocudiac's small group searched the palace walls until they
        found a weakness.

        13.26.3 When they found what they were looking for, they set about
        spreading a strange compound on the palace wall.

        13.26.4 Razmocudiac himself ignited the compound and was incinerated by
        the inferno that resulted.

        13.26.5 Nimnal, no man-at-arms, had remained inside the palace during
        the battle.

            13.26.5.1 He suggested a strategy for dealing with the superior
            force threatening to invade the palace.

            13.26.5.2 His counsel revealed both wisdom and detailed knowledge
            of the enemy's capabilities.

        13.26.6 Caliana set the battle plan according to Nimnal's suggestion
        when it became obvious that the wall would soon be breached.

    13.27 With Razmocudiac gone, Humjob led the krougs through the hole burned
    in the palace wall.

        13.27.1 The Calians met them ferociously and inflicted many casualties,
        but the krougs continued to come through the hole, and Humjob seemed
        invincible.

        13.27.2 Nimnal himself picked up a sword from one of the fallen palace
        guards and fought with a bizarre, insane fury.

            13.27.2.1 He stood toe to toe with the mighty Humjob, parrying the
            wild swings of the spiked chain, and gave the Calians time to clear
            a path along which to fall back.

            13.27.2.2 Eventually, Humjob's limitless endurance and strength
            defeated Nimnal, and the enemy poured in over his crushed, lifeless
            body.

        13.27.3 The Calians fell back, leading Humjob and the krougs along the
        path Nimnal had suggested, into the Room of Light.

    13.28 The intense light blinded Humjob, and he flailed wildly with his
    weapon, slaying some of his own troops.

        13.28.1 The krougs, confused by the light and Humjob's actions, turned
        their attack toward their own leader.

        13.28.2 Humjob struck out in the direction from which the attacks came,
        and he killed and maimed many of the krougs on his way back out of the
        hole.

    13.29 Humjob and the Calians pursued the remaining krougs around the palace
    and along the crystal road.

        13.29.1 Humjob, still blinded, continued down the mountainside,
        slaughtering and scattering the krougs.

        13.29.2 The Calians followed on his heels, disposing of the survivors
        of Humjob's attack and sending fodder down to Oslewt's troops.

        13.29.3 Caliana's injury prevented her from pursuing the enemy down the
        crystal road, and Hurn stayed on the summit as well to tend to her and
        prevent any further intrusion into the palace.

    13.30 Kroug, recognizing that the tide of battle had turned irrevocably
    against him, cast one last spell.

        13.30.1 Kroug turned into gigantic black dragon.

        13.30.2 He bypassed the warriors in a desperate bid to kill the one
        enemy who could prevent his eventual domination of the entire land:
        Caliana.

    13.31 The dragon charged to the top of the mountain and attempted to
    annihilate Caliana and Hurn, who were standing before the palace doors,
    with a fiery gust.

        13.31.1 Caliana cast a quick spell to protect herself and Hurn from the
        fire, but it was the last of her magic.

        13.31.2 Caliana and Hurn attacked the dragon, she with the blue *
        cypress lance and he with the filigreed sword.

        13.31.3 Some of the palace guards saw what was transpiring and rushed
        uphill to assist them, but they were too far out of position to have
        any effect.

    13.32 The dragon raised its head to deliver another blast.

        13.32.1 Caliana drove her lance into its exposed throat, blocking its
        airway completely.

        13.32.2 Hurn drove for a vital spot with his filigreed sword but the
        dragon grabbed him with its talons and immobilized him.

    13.33 The dragon clutched at the lance, trying to remove it and free the
    incendiary mixture caught in its throat.

        13.33.1 Hurn tossed his sword to Caliana so that she could free him.

        13.33.2 Caliana raised the sword to slash at the dragon's claw, but
        hesitated.

    13.34 Caliana swung the sword upward, slicing off the handle of the lance
    stuck in the dragon's throat.

        13.34.1 The bit of lance that still protruded from the dragon's neck
        was too small for it to get a grip.

        13.34.2 The dragon writhed in agony as its innards were incinerated.

        13.34.3 It crushed Hurn as it convulsed.

        13.34.4 The dragon dropped Hurn's body as it rolled down the
        mountainside into the darkness Kroug had cast only a few minutes
        before.

    13.35 When the darkness cleared, Mt. Kyrus was littered with the bodies of
    two armies, but there was no dragon corpse.

        13.35.1 Oslewt and Alamog formed two small companies from the surviving
        warriors and headed south in search of krougs.

        13.35.2 The palace guards were assigned to bury the dead, with special
        instructions to bury Hurn where he lay.

    13.36 In the days that followed, Caliana became ever more distracted and
    detached.

        13.36.1 She spoke, rambling sometimes, about the continuing presence of
        krougs in the land whose enchantment should have been broken when Kroug
        died.

        13.36.2 Her isolation grew profound after the discovery of Odium.

        13.36.3 Odium had not been killed in the Crux, but he had been maimed
        terribly, and even Caliana's magic could not help him.

    13.37 Caliana emerged from her seclusion long enough to give new
    instructions to the guild.

        13.37.1 Odium was relieved of his duties, and he retired to a secluded
        place in the forest to live out the remainder of his days in
        tranquility.

        13.37.2 Oslewt was put in charge of a permanent expeditionary force to
        hunt the krougs who were roaming the countryside in small groups.

        13.37.3 She sent forth Gamalus, a student of Nimnal who had shown a
        talent for conjuring, with instructions to oversee the repair of the
        palace wall with the assistance of Raspatoon.

        13.37.4 Caliana ordered a monument erected to Hurn on the spot where he
        was buried, noting that she should be summoned at a key point in the
        construction to add a magical blessing.

        13.37.5 Caliana abolished the system of single-race battalions in the
        Guild.
