                         Volume 14:  The Confederation


    14.1 The Calian calendar counts years from signing of the Compact at the
    Congress of Gelan.

        14.1.1 The years are named First Year of Confederation, Second Year of
        Confederation, etc.

        14.1.2 The day on which the Compact was finally signed is celebrated
        annually as *Confederation Day.

    14.2 The Congress of Gelan was called to establish a Confederation of the
    far-flung and disorganized cities, towns, and villages.

        14.2.1 The Council of the Warriors Guild sent invitations to all
        mayors, governors, and other rulers knows to them to attend the
        Congress.

        14.2.2 With assurance of protection on the roads from the Guild, many
        representatives attended.

        14.2.3 Skilled carpenters and masons set about building a hall for the
        Congress, including a tall tower with a great bronze bell.

        14.2.4 Small dwellings known as "hospitality bungalows" were quickly
        built to provide sleeping quarters for Congress attendees.

    14.3 The proceedings started with great rancor and discord, as many
    cultures were represented, both native and newcomer.

        14.3.1 The fight over who should chair the meeting lasted for days, as
        did arguments over procedure and representation.

        14.3.2 The Congress finally began to make progress when it was agreed
        that Raspatoon, the eldest by far, should chair the meeting.

    14.4 Raspatoon set a marble sphere of about a meter in diameter in the
    middle of the hall.

        14.4.1 Raspatoon ordered that only one may speak at a time, and only
        for as long as each could balance on the marble sphere.

        14.4.2 The attempts by the first few speakers to remain upright on the
        sphere proved comical.

        14.4.3 Once the attendees realized that the balance became easier with
        no armour, robes, or other trappings of rank, especially fancy leather
        shoes, the Congress began to relax and get down to business.

    14.5 The debate centered on the type of government the land should adopt.

        14.5.1 Some advocated a monarchy, and proposed the kings or queens of
        their own city-states for the position.

        14.5.2 Many favored crowning Caliana herself, even though she had
        declined to attend the Congress.

        14.5.3 Several proficient warriors suggested a trial by combat.

        14.5.4 Many other forms of government were proposed:  an elected
        senate, a council of elders, even a mystical oracle of the Ethereals.

    14.6 In all this debate, a key concern was the role of the Calian Warriors.

        14.6.1 It was recognized that regardless of the form of government, the
        Warriors were the greatest military power.

        14.6.2 All feared that whatever form of government was chosen would use
        the Warriors to gain tyrannical power.

    14.7 Finally, Marrock spoke and offered the plan which came to be known as *
    Marrock's Compromise.

        14.7.1 In his plan, there would be no central government.

        14.7.2 Each community could retain its present boundaries.

        14.7.3 The Warriors would be responsible for the elimination of rogue
        krougs and the suppression of any aggression by one community against
        another.

        14.7.4 The Warriors would only engage in combat within a community's
        borders under two conditions:

            14.7.4.1 They were attacked.

            14.7.4.2 Their help was requested by the local government.

    14.8 There was much more debate, but it eventually became apparent that
    Marrock's plan was the only one that would receive even tepid support from
    the majority.

        14.8.1 Raspatoon ordered two scribes, Bithnu and Phidmeck, to write
        down the text of *Marrock's Compromise as a compact which all parties
        could sign.

            14.8.1.1 In the Compact, Gelan was designated as the Warriors'
            administrative center so that anyone having business with them
            would not have to climb Mt. Kyrus.

            14.8.1.2 In the section defining the mission of the Warriors Guild,
            a quotation from Marrock's great speech was emblazoned in
            particularly large and ornate letters:  We Protect But Do Not Rule.

            14.8.1.3 The prominent quotation became known as the Calian Maxim,
            the motto which guided a Warrior's conduct within the borders of
            Calia.

        14.8.2 After an impassioned speech by Krom, with much loud assent by
        others who had participated in the Great Battle, "Calia" was adopted as
        the name of the land governed by the Compact.

        14.8.3 Marrock was voted the first administrator of Gelan.

        14.8.4 When the last delegate had signed the Compact, the event was
        heralded by the ringing of the great bronze bell, which was so loud
        that it could be heard even atop Mt. Kyrus.

    14.9 After the signing of the Compact by most of the attendees, a period of
    relative calm settled over the land.

        14.9.1 The population turned its attention back to business,
        agriculture, and other productive matters.

        14.9.2 The Compact was stored in the archives in Gelan, with the
        proviso that it would be available for future emissaries of Calian
        communities to sign and thus come under the protection of the Guild.
