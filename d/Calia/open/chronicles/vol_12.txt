                    Volume 12:  Annals of the Guild, Part I


    12.1 The troops rallied around Caliana, and amid much celebration and
    singing of battle-songs she led them through the moors and up to the base
    of Mt. Kyrus.

        12.1.1 The thick mist which had for so long obscured the upper
        elevations churned and seethed, and it now covered the mountainside
        almost down to the base.

        12.1.2 Where Caliana's lance-head touched the swirling mist, drops
        congealed, collected until they could no longer cling to the point, and
        fell to the ground in shimmering pools.

        12.1.3 The pools spread out into a wide path with smooth edges, as if
        an empty mold for its casting had lain here waiting for the substance
        to be poured, and hardened into a shiny crystalline surface.

        12.1.4 At the top, the mists parted to reveal a crystal palace on the
        spot where walled cities had once stood.

        12.1.5 The warriors adopted the palace as their new home, and named it
        the Calian Palace after their leader.

        12.1.6 The name "Calian" quickly became the name of the Warriors, who
        organized themselves according to Caliana's instruction.

    12.2 While the warriors trained, Caliana studied the ancient texts that had
    been preserved in the palace.

        12.2.1 She honed her magical skills, and devised a test to screen those
        who would join the ranks of the warriors.

        12.2.2 As her powers increased, she became more aloof from the daily
        affairs of the Guild.

        12.2.3 She blessed Krom and Marrock with the rare ability to see an
        enemy's approach at a distance.

        12.2.4 Word of Caliana's abilities spread throughout the land,
        suffering the inevitable exaggeration that comes from oft-told tales.

        12.2.5 Much of the population began to call their homeland "Caliana
        Land," a name which was soon shortened to "Calia."

    12.3 From opposite corners of the land, Caliana and Kroug began to squeeze
    out the other warlords.

    12.4 Caliana was determined to make allies if possible.

        12.4.1 She sent a captured goblin back to Masthron to make a peace
        offering.

        12.4.2 The goblin troops mocked the message brought back by the
        prisoner, but the philosophical Masthron decided to think it over.

    12.5 Masthron's consideration of the peace proposal was the final disgrace
    to many of his bloodthirsty Bosses.

        12.5.1 Since the episode with Bacco, Masthron had become much more of a
        thinker than a warrior.

        12.5.2 Discontent had been brewing among the Bosses for a long time.

        12.5.3 Screaming for revenge against both Caliana and the "weakling"
        Masthron, several Mobs broke into open rebellion.

    12.6 Masthron's troops, never well disciplined, fought among themselves and
    scattered.

        12.6.1 The time of Masthron's presence as a military leader had passed.

        12.6.2 Some goblins joined Calia's swelling ranks, led by Boss Fneeb.

        12.6.3 Others fled in various directions, a few even finding their way
        to Kroug.

        12.6.4 As for Masthron himself, he escaped, and tales have been told of
        his becoming a hermit somewhere deep in the northern forest.

    12.7 Hucker's dwarven army, routed from the high ground some time ago, was
    constantly on the defensive in skirmishes both against Kroug and Caliana.

        12.7.1 With each encounter against Kroug, more of Hucker's army would
        fall under his spell and turn on their comrades.

        12.7.2 When the day came that one of the new krougs turned on Hucker
        and killed him, the dwarven army was finished.

        12.7.3 Many were killed and many converted to krougs; the officer Mleck
        managed to rally a company who escaped and offered their loyalty to
        Caliana.

    12.8 News of Caliana's "destruction" of Masthron's powerful army reached
    Kroug.

        12.8.1 He became alarmed at this simple defeat of a powerful enemy
        without use of either arms or magic.

        12.8.2 Kroug determined that Caliana herself was a source of great
        power, and that without her the Warriors would eventually disintegrate.

    12.9 Kroug sent assassins after Caliana in a variety of guises.

        12.9.1 Some came as merchants, troubadours, or vagabonds, but none of
        these could get close to Caliana.

        12.9.2 Others came posing as potential warriors, but these were
        discovered when they could not pass the test Caliana devised for
        applicants.

    12.10 Kroug decided that the time had come for a full-scale war against
    Caliana.

        12.10.1 He realized that Caliana's magical powers were already great
        enough to thwart any spell he might cast on her.

        12.10.2 Oslewt remained the last major warlord between their two
        armies, and Kroug sensed that she might prefer Caliana as an ally
        rather than himself.

        12.10.3 Kroug planned a massive campaign to rid the land of Caliana,
        starring with a strike to clear Oslewt out of the way.

    12.11 The Second Conflagration began with Kroug and Caliana's forces vying
    for control of the territory occupied by Oslewt.

        12.11.1 Kroug made early gains by grabbing lands not defended by Oslewt
        or Caliana.

        12.11.2 Caliana and Oslewt, attacking independently, eroded Kroug's
        gains, but his troops plundered the land mercilessly before retreating.

    12.12 Kroug's implemented a scorched-ground policy and ordered his troops
    to kill all who could not be converted with his magic.

        12.12.1 Kroug centralized his power, abolishing most ranks and
        directing all aspects of battle directly.

        12.12.2 Caliana's army became more diversified, with various units
        dedicated to specialized tactics.

    12.13 Of those who had a choice, there emerged a pattern in the way
    warriors chose to join with Caliana or Kroug.

        12.13.1 Many common soldiers chose Kroug's juggernaut which gave an
        impression of invincibility.

        12.13.2 Warriors with more training and experience tended to join
        Caliana, where they might have a chance to demonstrate their skills and
        achieve some personal glory.

    12.14 Recognizing the incentive that personal glory would provide, Caliana
    instituted the system of titles for Calian warriors.

        12.14.1 She also formed a war council of her wisest and most
        experienced officers, choosing at least one of each race.

        12.14.2 Her purposeful inclusion of all races within her council
        encouraged good fighters, both native and adventurers from afar, to
        throw in their lot with Caliana.

        12.14.3 Yet the warriors generally preferred to organize themselves
        into single-race companies, and Caliana did not forbid this despite her
        misgivings.

    12.15 Kroug eventually drove far enough into Oslewt's range to cast a spell
    over many of her troops.

        12.15.1 Oslewt and her higher-ranking officers, suddenly beset by their
        own troops, made their escape.

        12.15.2 Kroug absorbed over half the gnome army into his own, but the
        Oslewt herself, her elite warriors, and their imposing weapons soon
        joined the service of Caliana.

    12.16 Caliana and Kroug consolidated their holdings until their territories
    evenly divided the land along the mountain range that runs from southwest
    to northeast.

        12.16.1 For a time, the hardships of crossing the mountains prevented
        large-scale assaults by either force against the other.

        12.16.2 Both armies began a period of rebuilding and retraining, during
        which an uneasy quiet settled upon the land.
