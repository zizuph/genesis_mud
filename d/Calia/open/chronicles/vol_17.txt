                       Volume 17:  Partings and Promises

    17.1 Marrock collected a few of Murl's valuable possessions and vowed to
    find her homeland and return them there.

    17.2 Caliana gave her last orders:

        17.2.1 A stone was cut from the Bleak Zone of East Calia and dragged
        laboriously up Mt. Kyrus and into the palace.

        17.2.2 Krom was appointed Guildmaster of the Calian Warriors.

    17.3 Caliana and the filigreed sword disappeared, leaving behind an
    enigmatic note, and Krom began his leadership of the guild which continues
    to this day.

        17.3.1 Krom ordered the handle of the blue cypress lance placed in the
        basement of the palace in a newly-constructed vault.

        17.3.2 Work began on fortifications around the perimeter of the palace
        grounds, although work was slow because of the labor involved in
        hauling stone and lumber up the crystalline road.
