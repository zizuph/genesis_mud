Mermaid ring:      /d/Calia/sea/objects/mermaid_ring.c
                   A reward for completing the mermaid sea quest, it has 
                   magical properties (see the domain's MAGIC file). It is 
                   automatically restored to players who have done the quest 
                   and lost it if they visit the room containing the mermaid 
                   (/d/Calia/sea/sector_0_0_0/rock). 

Calian medallions: These are issued to Calian warriors and add the guild
                   soul. They may be be restored simply by asking the npc 
                   guildmaster for a medallion at: 
                   /d/Calia/glykron/palace/rooms/light/trainroom.c
                   Path: /d/Calia/glykron/palace/objects/calian_medallion.c

Combat boots:      The guild item of the Cadets of Gelan layman guild, it 
                   adds the command soul, and can be personalised a little
                   by writing on them. They can be restored by going to the
                   guildmaster at /d/Calia/gelan/cadet/cadet_trainroom.c and 
                   typing <ask xorfin shoes> 
                   Path: /d/Calia/gelan/cadet/cadet_shoes.c

Ghost code:        This is added to players who kill shopkeepers in Gelan,
                   a type of haunting that lasts for a few minutes. 
                   Restoring these is not at all likely to be requested :)
                   Path: /d/Calia/gelan/objects/ghost.c

Hair shadow:       Players may buy a hairstyle from the hairdresser in Gelan.
                   Restoration is best achieved by the player purchasing 
                   a new haircut :)  Unfortunately autoloading shadows cause
                   other major headaches if they fail to load, so care should
                   be taken with the hair shadow file.
                   Path: /d/Calia/gelan/specials/hair_shadow.c

Tattoos:           Players who obtain tattoos from the tattoo parlour in
                   Gelan recieve their tattoos as autoloading objects
                   which use tattoo save files to remember what designs
                   that player had. The tattoo object is found in
                   /d/Calia/gelan/tattoos/tattoo.c

Serpent Ring:      An incidental reward in the Seer and the Lord Quest
                   in Eldoral. The ring is a permanent autoloader, until
                   the player uses the spell contained within the ring,
                   at which point it's lost forever. Before restoring
                   this object to players, check
                   /d/Calia/log/serpent_ring_usage. This log contains a
                   list of the players who have used the spell in the
                   ring. Only restore 'lost' serpent rings to players
                   whose name doesn not appear in this log. The file for
