Calia is a domain that is largely based on the Calian Chronicles which can
be found in our office in the Tower of Realms (/d/Calia/domain_office). The
domain is not based off of any published books, but out of the ideas and
thoughts of the wizards who currently and formerly inhabited the domain.
Traditionally the people drawn to becoming wizards in Calia have been
members of the Calian guild, who enjoyed the wacky and offbeat themes
found in the domain enough to want to make their own contributions.
There's still plenty of room for that in Calia, but we are also
interested in any prospective wizard with original ideas and a
desire to create serious fantasy.
