Magical items in Calia
----------------------

The Crystalline Palace and Foothills:
-------------------------------------
There are magical items found in the crystalline palace and on the foothills, 
having the relevant properties.  The items are: 

     sword of light (~Calia/palace/weapons/sword_of_light.c, 
     polearm of light ~Calia/palace/weapons/polearm_of_light.c)
     sword of darkness (~Calia/palace/weapons/sword_of_darkness.c, 
     polearm of darkness ~Calia/palace/weapons/polearm_of_darkness.c)
     mithril platemail (~Calia/palace/armours/mithril/platemail.c)

The sword/polearm of light emits light of strength 1, and the sword/polearm 
of darkness emits darkness of strength 1. They are wielded by the white 
warrior (/d/Calia/palace/monsters/white_calian.c) and black kroug 
(/d/Calia/mountain/monsters/kroug_commander.c) respectively, the white 
warrior being in the palace and the black kroug on the foothills, their hit 
and pen are both 40. A sword or polearm of darkness may be converted to their 
light equivalents by entering the room /d/Calia/palace/rooms/light/lightroom.c. 
The mithril platemail has nothing special about it apart from being well 
made armour with a bit of enchantment (ac 36). It is worn by the white 
warrior only. 

Gelan
-----
Gamalus, the guard at the entrance of Gelan 
(/d/Calia/gelan/monsters/entrance_guard.c) has a magic cloak 
(/d/Calia/gelan/armours/magic_cloak_guard_eye.c), which has armour class
of 30 but no other special effects. Gamalus uses a special magical attack 
when fighting. This takes the form of a spell that, when successful, either
(a) puts a special flame object into the inventory of the enemy, which 
periodically burns the victim, or (b) increases the intensity of the flame
if the enemy already has one.
This flame object is magical and its effectiveness determined by
the resistance on the player of MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE. It can do serious damage
as the amount of time it remains burning a victim varies, and each periodic
damage is quite high.

Moor
----
The magical items on the moor all relate to the polymorph quest, see
/d/Calia/QUESTS/polymorph_quest. The polymorph demon is a magical being
with strong transmutation magic, and its attacks do damage depending on
the magical cold, fire and acid resistance of the player.
The three types of items deposited by its attacks (icicle, charcoal and
acid drop) are all slightly enchanted, but are only useful in the quest
itself. The magical stone chipping and sapphire of draining that are 
obtainable in the quest are both powerfully enchanted, but are only useful 
in the quest itself.
The magical shield in the quest is highly enchanted and resists fire, 
cold and acid attacks when worn. The magic runs out and it disappears
after a couple of hours. Naturally it is only possible for any one person
to get this once in his/her player life. 

Sea
---
The reward for the mermaid quest is a silver ring which allows one 
to breathe water in the sea of Calia with effectiveness 70 when
worn (/d/Calia/sea/objects/mermaid_ring.c). For magic purposes the ring
is enchanted. 

Eldoral
-------
There are two magic items involved with quests in Eldoral.
The first is the Serpent ring (~Calia/eldoral/armours/magic_ring.c).
This object is an 'incidental' reward players get when they've
solved the Sword and the Lord Quest. It contains a spell, which
when cast will do up to 1000 hp of damage to any undead in the room
at a cost of 1000 mana. Once done, the ring destroys itself (so once
it's been used once, it's gone). Usage is logged in
~Calia/log/serpent_ring_usage, which notes when players used the
powers of the ring at it removed itself. Once a ring has been used
in this way, it cannot be obtained again, and should never be
given back to a player by a wizard.

The second magic item is the 'King's Hand', an object required by
players doing the Calian Sup. Guru Quest, and is located in
~Calia/eldoral/armours/gauntlet.c. It must be 'recharged' when
first found, which is part of the quest, before it becomes magic.
After that, a player can use it to crush weapons, armours, or the
chain which must be broken to solve the quest. Each gauntlet can
only be used once by each player, though a player can still use
other gauntlets. The gauntlet retains it's powers after use, ideally
to be passed to another Calian who may use it.

There is another magic item in Eldoral, in the undead tunnels. A pair
of snake-skin gloves. They slightly modify the hit descriptions of 
the attacker if they are unarmed and raise their unarmed combat skill
by 5 points while worn.

Thalassia
---------

There are two magic items in the underwater city of Thalassia. The
King of Thalassia (found at /d/Calia/sea/thalassia/citadel/palace_1_6.c)
wields a magical trident (/d/Calia/sea/weapons/magic_trident.c). This is
a clone_unique item and only two of them can ever be in the game at any
one time. The weapon requires 65 strength, 80 intelligence and 65 polearm
skill to wield, is intelligent (it talks to the wielder), does 10-40% 
extra damage to krougs, and has a hit of 50 + random(10) and a pen of
50 + random(10). When the person wields it, it lowers their defence and
parry skill by 10 points each using set_skill_extra. If they do not have
10 points of defence, no penalty is given. If they do not have 10 points
of parry, no penalty is given.

There are five triton magicians wandering around the Citadel area of the
city. They carry a magical water staff. This staff gets a higher hit/pen
for a wielder that has skill in water magic and has a 1 in 8 chance of
doing a short attack delay on hit if that is the case. The weapon gets
a +1 hit/+1 pen bonus for every 10 points of water magic skill the wielder
has over 30. This staff (and a fire/water/earth/air/life version of them)
are also wielded by the elder temple NPCs in the Elemental Temple.
