    The Elemental Power of Pagos
    ============================

    This power, granted by Lord Diabrecho, enchants a wielded 
    weapon with cold, making it more effective in combat. The
    weapon will however become more brittle after a casting.
    To use the power one needs knowledge of water magic, in 
    addition to competency in enchantment spells. The ingredient 
    needed to use this spell is the gem rose quartz.
