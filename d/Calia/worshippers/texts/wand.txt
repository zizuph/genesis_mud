    The Fire Wand of Pyros
    ======================

    This wand connects the member to Pyros, the Elemental God of Fire,
    and when properly enchanted grants the member the power to unleash
    the elemental fires of Purkagia.  The wand is comprised of a small
    wooden stick or dowel which is straightened and smoothed, then
    coated in copper.  The name of the Elemental God of Fire must first
    be carved along the wand, followed by the member's name.  Once the
    Word of Power 'Ergon' is carved into it, it shall grant it's
    member the use of the powers of Fire.
