    The Elemental Power of Evimero
    ==============================

    This power, granted by Lady Aeria only to those who 
    choose her as their patron, temporarily lends the caster 
    the speed of wind. To use the power one needs good 
    knowledge of earth magic, in addition to competency in 
    enchantment spells. The ingredient needed to use this 
    spell is the herb chicory.
