    The Elemental Power of Purkagia
    ===============================

    One of the gifts you will recieve from Lord Pyros is the 
    power to smite your foes with the Elemental Fire.  To use
    this power you will need moderate skill in both the arts of
    fire and divination spells, as well as skill in spellcraft.
    Be warned, you cannot use the power of Purkagia while submerged
    in water, nor can you use it while wielding any sort of weapon.  
    You must have grey willow to use this gift.
