    The Water Chalice of Diabrecho
    ==============================

    This chalice connects the member to Diabrecho, the Elemental God
    of Water, and when properly enchanted grants the member the power
    to control the fluids of the body with Aleipso.  The chalice is
    comprised of a glass or chalice which is repaired of all imperfections
    and washed, then coated in gold.  The name of the Elemental God of
    Water must first be carved on the outer lip of the chalice, followed
    by the member's name.  Once the Word of Power 'Meizon' is carved onto
    it, it shall grant it's member the use of the powers of Water.
