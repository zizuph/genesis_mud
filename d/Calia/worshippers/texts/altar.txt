    The Silver Altar Chamber
    ========================

    The Altar Chamber is where people may pray to the Elementals to
    receive guidance from them.  It is also the place to betray them
    if you decide you no longer wish to serve them, but be warned -
    know the consequences before doing so.  You shall find another
    scroll here on that topic.  If it is your intention to become
    one with the Elementals, then it is the silver altar in the
    Altar Chamber that you seek.
