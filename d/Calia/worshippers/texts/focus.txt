    The Focus Chamber
    =================

    The Focus Chamber is one of the most magical rooms in the temple.
    There members of the circle can contemplate to see what skills
    can be learned there, pray to each God or Goddess by name, then 
    focus to gain knowledge in each of the magical arts.  It is a 
    wonderous chamber that must be seen to be believed.
