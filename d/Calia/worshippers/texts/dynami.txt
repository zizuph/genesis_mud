    The Elemental Power of Dynami
    =============================

    This power, granted by Lady Gu only to those who choose
    her as their patron, temporarily lends the caster the 
    strength of earth. The caster will become stronger, 
    healthier and more disciplined. To use the power one 
    needs good knowledge of earth magic, in addition to 
    competency in enchantment spells. The ingredient needed
    to use this power is the herb cranberry.
