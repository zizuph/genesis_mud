    The Elemental Power of Psotia
    =============================

    One of the gifts you recieve from Lord Pyros is the power
    to summon a djinni to light a path for you.  This power
    requires a good skill in the art of fire spells and a good
    skill in the art of conjuration, as well as some skill
    in spellcraft. You can also ask it to engulf you, becoming
    a flaming shield. To use this spell you need the gem 
    bloodstone.
