    The Elemental Power of Floga
    ============================

    This power, granted by Lord Pyros to those who choose him 
    as their patron, summons a lance of flame to burn a target.
    To use the power one needs good knowledge of fire magic, in 
    addition to competency in conjuration spells. The ingredient 
    needed to use this spell is the herb fireweed.
