    As a member of the Elemental Worshippers, you will be offered
    training in communing with the Elementals, as well as some rudimentary
    combat skills.  As well, expect lessons in linguistics and herblore.
    We have no racial restrictions, nor any alignment restrictions,
    but do not be fooled into thinking that we haven't any rules.
    You shall be expected to honour and respect all members of this
    clerical circle, no matter their race or alignment.
    You shall also ensure there is no bloodshed inside the Elemental Temple.
    No member shall ever take the life of another, for if they try, the
    punishment shall be severe.

    If you are interested in joining our circle, enter the altar chamber
    east and south of here, and pray to the Elementals there.
