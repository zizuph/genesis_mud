    Lady Gu, Elemental of Earth, Ruler of the Lands
    ===============================================

    Lady Gu is a lady of nature, with vivid green eyes and rich, wavy
    brown hair, often wearing a long gown of flowers.  She is a tranquil
    spirit, generally at peace with all Creation, but beneath the
    serenity lurks a dark, dour side to her, ruthless and hard when the
    need arises.  She speaks like the sound of stones running down a
    mountainside and wears a crown of stone roses.  Most compassionate
    and understanding of the Elementals, she can be severe in her revenge
    if sufficiently provoked.
