    The Elemental Power of Choma
    ============================

    One of the gifts you recieve from Lady Gu is the power
    to summon a golem to carry some of your load for you.
    This power requires a good skill in the art of earth
    spells and a good skill in the art of conjuration spells,
    as well as some skill in spellcraft.  You can give objects
    to the golem.  Once the golem is carrying your items, you
    can ask it for a certain item, a list of its 'things' or
    for all of your 'items' back.  The golem will drop all items 
    carried if you do not collect them when it is time for it to 
    leave. You may also ask your golem 'get', which will cause it 
    to get any items on the ground that it can carry.  If you give
    it a backpack, you may also use the 'fill' and 'empty' 
    commands to respectively fill and empty the backpack that 
    it holds. You can also request that it engulfs you, becoming
    an armour. To use this spell you need the gem yellow beryl.
