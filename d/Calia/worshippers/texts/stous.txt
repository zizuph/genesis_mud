    The Elemental Power of Stous
    ============================

    One of the gifts you recieve from Lady Aeria is the power
    to summon a spirit to relay a message for you.  This power
    requires a good skill in the art of air spells and a good
    skill in the art of divination spells, as well as some skill
    in spellcraft.  You can ask the spirit to shout a message 
    which will be heard up to three rooms around you.  You can 
    also ask the spirit to call a message to all other members 
    of the circle that are within the realms.  The messages you 
    are allowed to call are 'welcome', 'farewell', 'help', or 
    'greetings'. You can also ask it to engulf you, becoming a
    shield of wind. To use this spell you need the gem 
    aquamarine.
