    The Elemental Power of Kataraktas
    =================================

    One of the gifts you recieve from Lord Diabrecho is the
    power to summon a water weird that will give you gifts.
    This power requires a good skill in the art of water spells
    and a good skill in the art of conjuration spells, as
    well as some skill in spellcraft.  You can ask the water
    weird for two items, a decanter, or a flagon.  The decanter
    contains an alcoholic liquid, where the flagon contains nothing
    but water.  You can drink from either of these items, but you
    may only give the flagon away to others.  The weird will stay only
    a short time, as will the flagon and decanter. You can also 
    request that it engulfs you, becoming a shield of ice. To use
    this spell you need the gem amethyst.
