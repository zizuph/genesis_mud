    The Air Dagger of Aeria
    =======================

    This dagger connects the member to Aeria, the Elemental Goddess of
    Air, and when properly enchanted grants the member the power to
    send messages afar with the power of Anemos.  The dagger is comprised
    of a pure dagger or knife which is washed, then it is coated in silver.
    The name of the Elemental Goddess of Air must first be carved along the
    hilt of the dagger, followed by the member's name.  Once the Word of
    Power 'Egsousia' is carved into it, it shall grant its member the use
    of the powers of Air.
