    The Earth Pentacle of Gu
    ========================

    This pentacle connects the member to Gu, the Elemental Goddess of
    Earth, and when properly enchanted grants the member the power to
    sheathe their body with the powers of Teikos.  The pentacle is comprised
    of a small plate or shallow bowl which is smoothed, washed, a
    pentagram is carved in the centre on the inside face, then it is
    coated in platinum.  The name of the Elemental Goddess of Earth must
    first be carved along the outside edge of the pentacle, followed by
    the member's name.  Once the Word of Power 'Ischuroteros' is carved into it,
    it shall grant it's member the use of the powers of Earth.
