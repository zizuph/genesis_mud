The players will have to scale the rocks at /d/Calia/sea/beach/village7
in order to get to Road.  They can continue south to get onto the Path.
South from the Path will be the Archway.  They can enter the Archway 
which brings them to Entrance.  Here they have three exits (W, E, S).
West Chamber and East Chamber are almost identical to each other.  
They will be guard chambers, each holding a few guild npc's to guard
the temple from attack.  The South Chamber will contain an altar 
and will serve as the joinroom for the guild.  There will be three
exits from the South Chamber (SW, N, SE).  To the southwest will
be the Post Office, to the southeast will be the Boardroom.  Those rooms
will be private and not accessable by non-members.  Both the 
Post Office and the Boardroom will have an exit to the Startroom.
