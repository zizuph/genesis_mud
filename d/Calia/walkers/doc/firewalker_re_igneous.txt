//Mana costs are easily modified.

Proposed revised spell list:

-Tell line. Only a cosmetic change here. It will appear as a fire 
spirit whispering a message to the recipent - thus visible to others
in the room. Conjuration spell.
-Light. Only cosmetic change, except no longer castable at others
than self. Not stackable. Conjuration spell.
-Blind. Component change to the herb smooth camas. Conjuration spell.
It won't be stackable.

-Wall of fire. Blocks an exit. Attempts to leave result in 
3 * random (spell_power) damage, fire resistance being taken
into account. I'll use something like:
if (target->resolve_task(TASK_FORMIDABLE, ({SKILL_WEIGHT, 150, TS_DIS,
SKILL_END})) > 0) {success in breaking through the wall}
Component is now a potion made out of alcohol and gray willow.
Mana unchanged. Conjuration spell.

-Flame shield. Doesn't offer any defensive bonus as such, but damages
attackers with each hit they make. The shield provides a level of 
light also. Damage with each hit equal to spell_power modified by
fire resistance, unless (target->resolve_task(TASK_DIFFICULT, 
({SKILL_WEIGHT, 150, TS_DEX, SKILL_END}) > 0), in which case damage
is avoided. Component: Cranberry and some 
collectible item from the guild. Mana cost and duration unchanged, 
and it cannot be cast on others than self. Conjuration spell.

-Flame arrow. Bolt, with a penetration of :
2*guildstat + 5 * spell_power, to a maximum
of 500. The bolt can be aimed at a certain location. A potion
mixed out of fireweed and alcohol would be the component. Mana
cost 75. Conjuration spell.

-Enrage. Target gets a 50% increase in discipline, and a 50%
reduction of dexterity. 5 min duration.
Only works if target is fighting, and the spell can't be "stacked".
Mana cost: 110. Component: the herb chicory and some component 
collectible at the guild. Enchantment spell.

-Resist fire. Same as the old spell, except that the duration goes
up to five minutes, and the component is now just the herb
fireweed, not a potion. It can still be cast on others to protect
them. Abjuration spell.

-Flame wind. Bolt, with a penetration of two times the penetration
of the "Flame arrow" spell, to a max of 1200. All armours the target
is wearing, that aren't magical or above AC 20, are consumed by the 
spell. Mana cost 200, component is a potion of fireweed, gray willow
and alcohol. Conjuration spell.

-Luminosity. Walker becomes as bright as the sun, emitting 5 light
levels. Not stackable, 80 mana, component is black currant. Duration
is 15 minutes. Enchantment spell.

-Flame weapon. Summons a staff of flame. It's a polearm with a
hit and pen of: (guildstat + 2 * spell_power) / 5.
Min is 40/40, max is 50/50. It will have special hit descriptions 
and do a heal_hp of -random(spell_power) 20% of the time. It can't
be un-wielded for the duration (though it is possible to dismiss 
it), nor given away. Duration is 20 minutes. Mana cost 120.
Components: Fireweed and cladina. Conjuration spell.

-Fire spirit. A vengeful fire spirit arrives and hunts a target.
It won't be an NPC as such, but will keep damaging the target.
Damage will equal to random(3*spell_power) each time, for 5-10 
times, fire resistance figured in of course.
// I take issue with your downgrading of the spell in your comments.
// I've put it somewhere between my former suggestion and your
// proposal. I believe there are strong reasons for doing so.
// The way you proposed it, you'd need someone with 180 INT using
// all their mana to have a good chance of killing off a wizlevel
// con (figuring 8*30(half the spell_power)*10 = 2400 hp), with a
// couple of quick heals saving him. What's the reasoning behind 
// having it this weak? Any fighter worth anything will decimate the
// caster in the time it takes to cast the 10 spells and wait for
// them to work. Conversely, if a Morgul stacked up 10 poisons in
// someone (which is just another form of persistant damage), the
// target would be dead as a duck - this would be the case even with
// half that amount of poisons. The way it makes sense to me,
// is for persistant damage spells to have *more* damage potential
// than a bolt, as the target has opportunities both to quit out
// and to heal himself. 
This spell *can* be stacked. Mana cost: 180. Component
is a potion of fireweed, black currant, poison ivy and alcohol.
Conjuration spell.

-Burst of light. Blinds and does add_stun to all others 
in the room. Stun is half the duration of the blindness.
Blindness lasting 30-60 seconds. Mana cost 150. Components are
Chicory and beaked sedge. Conjuration spell.
Not stackable.

-Fire storm. This is a bolt that hits all present enemies. Damage would
be equal to one and a half time the Flame Arrow spell except with a 
ceiling of 1000. Mana cost 250. Component: Potion of fireweed, 
chantrelle, grey willow and alcohol. Conjuration spell.

-Hellscape. Room temperature increases by a couple of hundred degrees
or so. People with high fire resist are safe, others keep taking damage.
The caster is not excluded from the effect, unless of course he cast
resist fire on himself first. The damage is equal to a random number
between 100 and 200 every 10 seconds for 15 times. This spell 
can't be stacked. Since NPCs do not normally know to move out of 
danger, the spell would include code to give a certain % chance for
an NPC to try and flee with each time damage is dealt. Mana cost:
220. Component: Onoclea, cladina and poison ivy. Enchantment spell.

The Walker guild will have a total of six cooperative spells, only
usable with two Walkers present of different elements. These spells
have not yet been planned in detail, but here's a preliminary
suggestion for the ones involving fire:

-Fire/Water: Boiling blood. Persistent damage spell.
// Again, what is the problem with persistant damage?
-Fire/Air: Flaming chariot. Summons a chariot that can fly to any
outdoor location in the Realms that has been marked. Up to four
Walkers can board it.
-Fire/Earth: Lava globule. Bolt spell, destroys equipment randomly.

// I'm exactly at the 700 limit now. Feels like I've stripped them.
// Guess its just a consequence of mages needing more skills to do
// their stuff and having the same skill limit as fighters.

// Also a question - did you account for the component availability
// when reviewing the spells? In most cases I've increased the
// components required, which should count for some decrease in mana
// or increase in power.
