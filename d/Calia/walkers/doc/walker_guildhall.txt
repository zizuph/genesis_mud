Suggestion for Walker guildhall.

I'm just going to go through all the rooms that would be there.
There might be some filler rooms of course, but not many.
It's basically what appears to be a small stone house. Entering
it, one will come into a room that seems to take up most of the
house, with a guardian watching a door that leads into what
is obviously a small room. Now, there is an illusion on this 
building. It's actually a large tower. The door in leads to
the guild. Where the guildhouse is located I'm not exactly sure
of. I thought I'd confer with you and come up with a good 
location for it.

-Herbalist/potion-seller: The alchemist here will also provide
training in alchemy/herbalism.

-Library: The librarian trains language.

-Guild meeting room. A large circle of chairs, with a bulletin board.

-Council meeting room. A room of four chairs, also a bulletin board.
Here would be some council commands - like removing someone from the
council.

-Start room. With beds, etc.

-There would be four offices, one for each council member. He would
be able to invite people in there, etc. The room would also contain
some commands for him, like promoting/demoting Walkers, listing all
the members, etc.

-There would be an equipment room, with a couple of chests for 
storing things.

-There would be four training rooms, one for each element, that 
trained the magic skills (except magic ritual) for the respective
branch. 

-There would also be four rooms, one for each element, for rest,
meditation and contemplation. They will have descriptions very tied
to the element in question, perhaps a swimming pool for water, 
incense etc for fire.

-The entrance room to the guild, here is a guardian. The guardian
is an amazingly powerful fighter, and will teach the members some
polearm/defence to defend themselves with. Furthermore, the guardian
is not a mortal, but a magical construct. If defeated, he'll 
instantly reappear with full health again.

-Observatory. Here is a telescope, and a person who will train the
Walkers in awareness.

-Ritual room. A large room to perform magic rituals in. The person
in charge of the room trains the skill.

-Shop. Sells robes, packs, pouches, satchels, jars, maybe a staff
or two.

-Balcony overlooking the surrounding area.
