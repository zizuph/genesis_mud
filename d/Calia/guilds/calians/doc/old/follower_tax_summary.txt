Tax Summary for Followers of the Calian guild
============================================

When a player first joins the Calian guild, he or she becomes
a follower, until accepted as a trainee by a councillor or 
recruitment officer. 

Combat aid
----------
Trainees get to train the Calian specials to the level of superior 
professional (70 levels). At this level, the offensive specials 
are less likely to hit, and do less damage. The move behind maneuver is 
less likely to be successful. 

Solo Calian:
    swarm combat aid:                   0%
    riposte combat aid:                 30% (evade and attack)

Tanking Team Calian:
    swarm combat aid:                   25% (evade)
    riposte combat aid:                 45% (evade and attack)
    total:                              70%

Swarming Team Calian (only 1 Calian):
    swarm combat aid:                   52.5% (attack only)
    total:                              52.5%
    
Swarming Team Calian (with more Calians):
    swarm combat aid:                   60% (attack only)
    swarm assist evade combat aid:      10% (evade for tanker)
    total:                              70%
    
The maximum combat aid for a Calian at any time really is about 70%
when you take the effect of teams into account. Given their specialist
standing and the drawback of needing a team to use swarm, the typical
discount was 11 / 20. Because they always have 30% when solo, this 
portion is not discounted.

Total tax for this combat aid: (30 / 6) + (40 * (11 / 20) / 6) = 8.66%


Other benefits
--------------
The guild has a member-to-member tell line, which costs 4% tax,
but followers are not allowed to send tells. Therefore, they do
not incur the extra 4% tax.

Followers are changed the 1% tax for move behind.

Skills
------
polearm   (50 - 30) / 60 * 1.5 = 0.50% tax
sword     (50 - 30) / 60 * 1.5 = 0.50% tax
two-handed combat  40 / 60 * 2.0 = 1.33% tax
parry              40 / 60 * 1.5 = 1.00% tax
defence            (50 - 20) / 60 * 1.5 = 0.75% tax


Total guild tax: 

  8.66 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.33 + 1.00 + 0.75
= 13.7% tax
= 14% tax rounding up
