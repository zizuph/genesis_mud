Combat aid for Riposte
======================

For information on riposte background and how it fits into Calia's 
history, see ~Calia/guilds/calians/texts/battle. 

Riposte is the only ability that Calians are able to use when solo.
It is essentially a tanker ability, allowing them to parry incoming
attacks and immediately launch a counter attack. The attack itself is
quite weak, but when in a Calian team, the riposte attack becomes
much stronger.

Combat Aid
----------
Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
and all other calculations are set. Riposte evade is set at 20%, which
yields 25% combat aid. The Riposte attack when solo is set to 25%
combat aid in the special. However, because the evade is 20%, the
effective combat aid is actually only 5%. When in a Calian team,
the Riposte attack is set to 100% combat aid, which yields a 20%
effective combat aid.

                Riposte Evade           Riposte Attack
Solo Calian     25% combat aid          5% combat aid
Team Calian     25% combat aid          20% combat aid

Frequency
---------
Riposte can occur only once per round, no matter how many times attacks
are parried. This is to prevent it from being a ridiculous and silly
attack when many attacks are evaded at once.

Hit chance
----------
Riposte tohit has been set to 70. There are a couple factors that can
reduce this by 15% each:

     1. Weapon is not a sword or polearm
     2. Opponent is at least 3 times more massive

Penetration
-----------
Penetration of riposte varies depending on the weapon's pen and player's
DEX.

Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
