##
## I am trying to have a caster guild (that takes up all usable guild slots,
## including racial) that is viable for soloing in. If you can't take a hit from 
## someone, you can't really kill anything without using the 'run in, damage them,
## run out, heal' method or the 'run in, damage them, heal, damage them, heal, 
## heal, damage them, out of mana, run away, recharge, run back in, etc...' method. 
## Neither of those methods are enjoyable. I am following the tax and alien skill 
## rules and they are paying the price for having such high defence and parry 
## skills (at the cost of lower SS_FORM skills which as you have pointed out will 
## lead to a higher 'failed cast' rate that most other casting guilds).
##
## I would be willing to talk about maybe limiting which higher skills go to 
## which branch. As an example I would think that only 'fire' getting the extra
## club skill would fit the theme of damage dealers whereas only 'earth' getting
## the extra parry skill would fit the theme of tank. The other branches would get
## extra SS_FORM points instead of the higher club/parry. I would argue though
## that all branches would get the higher defence.
##

##
## I will be implementing components for the non-branch specific spells in the
## other branches as suggested. (i.e. fire will have no components for damage spells
## but will have components for things such as healing, buffing, etc...). 
##
## As for the CAID adjustments between branches, what kind of numbers would you
## suggest to put in there? For instance the heal at maximum is 100 for water, 
## but only 90 for fire and 95 for air/earth/spirit. The damage spell maximum
## for fire is 100 but only 90 for water and 95 for air/earth/spirit.
## Would 100 (primary role), 90 (secondary role), 80 (opposite role) work?
##

## I'm going to remove the poison spells all together - this seems like a path that

##
## That's where I calculated where the CAID went, not that they are for a 
## layman branch (there is no layman branch of the clerics, the guild
## takes both the occ and lay (and optionally racial) slots of the player).
## I just wanted to show where the CAID went in terms of the total amount
## of CAID available. I can take out the Lay/Occ, it was just for my 
## sanity.

##
## Again, there is no layman branch - it's just where I was calculating 
## the overall CAID to ensure it didn't go above the total for Lay and Occ
## slots. I'll take this out to avoid confusion of anyone looking at the 
## documents.

ELEMENTAL CLERICS SPELLS DESCRIPTION AND BREAKDOWN
==================================================

> Some general comments/requests:

> It would help me if we could also add under the Components section whether the

>        Peaceful: No; Stationary: Yes; Verbal: Yes; Visual: Yes.

##
## Noted and I will put those in the next document for you to review
##



> Can I get some documentation on the ritual system that is essentially replacing ingredients?

##
## Ritual components are components that are made in the ritual chamber. If there is one
## listed as a component, it is required for the spell to work. In order to make the
## ritual component, the player has to take the appropriate ingredients to the ritual
## chamber and create them using a ritual. It is basically a space saving method for
## the players in that they can carry around <x> ritual components instead of <x> herbs
## AND <x> gems or <x> leftovers AND <x> herbs. I will add something to the documentation
## that will show the ritual components and what are required to make each.
##

> Also, can you send me through any feedback you have from our beta testers? I'd like to read

##
## I received them in email usually and once I was done with whatever corrections were there, 
## I deleted them so I don't actually have any I can show you. I will ask for formal testing
## reports from the testers now so I can pass them on to you.
##

>>>> I think so :)

Schirmo (Elemental Shield)

## Clerics. We can certainly look at it.

Effect              : Adds 25% combat aid worth of elemental resistance for

## I'm not sure I follow how you got the numbers you got but I will likely just remove the

Aleipso (Lesser Heal)
=====================
Effect              : Restores lost HP or damage Undead
Element             : Water
Form                : Enchantment
Acquire Level       : Child / 1 guild stat
Area of effect      : One present target

Components          : None
CAID                : 55% (Occupational)
Tax                 : None - Taxed based on full power below (see Aleipso 
                      (Major Heal) below)
Special Description : This spell is replaced by greater versions of itself as 
                      the player progresses in the guild.

##
## When I tried doing this originally, two things came to light. First, that routine
## (query_spell_combat_aid_modifier()) seemed to only be called ONE time, when the 
## spell was originally loaded - meaning whomever logged in first after armageddon
## is the one who was setting the parameters for the spell for EVERYONE. Second,
## trying to figure out by what percentage to modify it seemed to be needlessly
## confusing (ie. make it 60% of what it was listed at) when you could just set 
## the value directly to what you wanted based on what you wanted (ie. it is 
## <x> in this circumstance and <y> in this circumstance). For someone reviewing
## the numbers, I think it is much easier to see what the value WILL be rather 
## than having to look back at the set value and then do some calculation to see
## what it will actually be. Those two reasons are why I did it that way in all 
## of the spells that have a variable CAID depending on circumstances.

Dynami (Stat Boosts)
====================
Effect              : Adds boost to Strength (10%/20%), Constitution (10%/20%), 
                      and Discipline (7.5%/15%).
Element             : Earth
Form                : Enchantment
Acquire Level       : Child / 1 guild stat
Area of effect      : Caster
Spell Class Level   : Power 3 - Intermediate Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : 30% or 60% (Layman)
Tax                 : 0.75%
Special Description : This spell has a 30% CAID (Strength 10%/Constitution 10%
                      /Discipline 7.5%) or 60% CAID (Strength 20%/Constitution
                      20%/Discipline 15%) - it scales depending on the
                      combination of the other buff spell (Evimero). If 
                      only this spell is active it is 60% CAID. If Evirmero 
                      spell is active they are each 30% CAID.

##
## Yeah, that's my cut/paste stupidity - you are correct on the numbers, they should be 
## 10/10/10 and 20/20/20. I will adjust those in the document.

Special Description : This spell has a 30% CAID (25% haste boost)
                      or 60% CAID (50% haste boost) - it scales 
                      depending on the combination of the other buff spell
                      (Dynami). If only this spell is active it is 60% CAID. 
                      If Dynami spell is active they are each 30% CAID.

>   set_spell_target isn't set to spell_target_caster, as outlined in area of effect above.

##
## set_spell_target(spell_target_haste); which resolves to
## return spell_target_caster(caster, str); is what it was.
## I changed it to spell_target_caster. Not sure why I masked it but

Thafloga (Fire Tendrils At-Will)
================================
Effect              : Attacks a single enemy with fire-based tendril attacks

                      /Kryo/Oxy/Ousia below)
Special Description : This spell is replaced by Enkav/Astrapi/Kryo/Oxy/Ousia 
                      below once player has reached Master Cleric rank and 
                      has selected a branch.

##
## I would dispute the 'learning someone's name is a pretty big deal' these days
## since the 'who' command for mortals shows both who they do know and who they 
## don't know (by name) when they do the command. Most players that are serious

Skiamorfi (Elemental Form)
==========================
Effect              : Turn into elemental form
Element             : Depends (Earth, Fire, Air, Water or Spirit)
Form                : Transmutation
Acquire Level       : Master / 60 guild stat
Area of effect      : Self
Spell Class Level   : Power 2 - Minor Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : None (Optional 10 from Racial guild)
Tax                 : 0.875%
Special Description : This turns the caster into elemental form. This gives a 
                      minor aid to the caster in that their inventory of 
                      items is hidden from view (thieves can still steal from 
                      them though). It also has a chance to give them a small 
                      evade ability and possibly a small magical resistance
                      ability. If they are a member of the optional Racial 
                      guild, it also gives them the ability to see invisible 
                      creatures as well as change the "form" they take. Taxing
                      extra 0.500% for the evade/resistance although they 
                      aren't guaranteed when it is cast that they will get 
                      them.

##
## I didn't know what to put as CAID so I was hoping you would give it a value. Also
## yes, they can keep casting it until they get the form they want however that will
## cost them mana each cast and likely won't change the outcome anyways unless they

##
## I can remove the magic resistance portion or lower it substantially to a set number

## 
## I don't understand how both + 5 darkness/+10 invis and +5 darkness/+5 invis can be
## 20% CAID - clearly one of those should be higher than the other. And if that is the 
## case, how +1 darkness/+1 invis would be half of that at 10% CAID. If we take the
## lowest one (+5 dark/+5 invis) is 20%, I would argue that +1 dark/+1 invis would be
## at most 1/5th of that at 4% CAID.
##
## The level of invis seems to work the same way the level of darkness does - If your

##
## I'm not sure poison works how you think it works. The poison strength is part of a 
## formula that is used to determine the actual 'damage' per tick. In the example above
## (dispel time 600 which would be 30 ticks of interval 20, strength 100, mana damage
## 150) you claim it will do 30 ticks of mana damaging 4500 total at a rate of 450
## mana/minute. In reality it will do some type of forumla that contains random in it
## that actually doesn't take anywhere near that much mana and each tick is different.

## I based this off the rangers disarm actually rather than the naro spell. The MM

## disarmed rather than helpless if they didn't actually have another weapon to

CAID                : 60% (Occupational)
Tax                 : 0.750%
Special Description : This spell pounds (damages) the target's armour with 
                      a possibility it breaks (if it gets damaged enough). 
                      It also does damage to the target. This spell is

Special Description : This spell summons a shadow wall that blocks a single 
                      exit. Undeads cannot move through this wall, anyone 
                      else can. It blocks the exit for a maximum of 54 
                      seconds. The actual time is calculated by the 
                      casters SS_SPELLCRAFT, SS_ELEMENT_LIFE and 
                      SS_FORM_CONJURATION skills 
                      (MIN(54, SS_SPELLCRAFT + SS_ELEMENT_FIRE + 
                      SS_FORM_CONJURATION)).
					  The caster cannot cast this spell for 30 seconds once
					  it is cast and they cannot cast it if an existing 
					  wall is still in place. This spell is spirit branch 
					  only.

##
## I based this off the 'block' skill. While the block skill can eventually allow a player to
## pass the exit and this one can't, I chopped the time down accordingly. This time is a bit
## higher than the other exit blocking spell but only because it only effects undead (non-undead

##
## I figured since you could effectively start combat with someone, be losing badly and then
## drop a wall and run through it and your attacker couldn't, there would be combat aid

Special Description : This spell can have a blacklist of rooms that players 
                      can't teleport to (namely guild halls, places they 
                      shouldn't be, etc...). Right now it uses the base
                      teleport spell which takes a lot of that into 
                      consideration already. This spell is air branch only.

                      globe to a known player of the caster. The water
                      globe is summoned by a command that only the water
                      cleric has (eglobe) and they can only have one of
                      them. They can insert small items into the globe up
                      to the maximum volume of the globe (currently set

                      blocks the exit for a maximum of 36 seconds. The

> This spell should be set as set_spell_offensive.

##
## This spell in itself shouldn't initiate combat should it? It could be used
## as a deterrent instead of an actual attack on the target. It tells the
## target their resistance has been lowered. That could be enough to convince
## them to back down.

> The impact of this spell would also make it a Power 4 spell.

##
## I'm confused as to how raising one's own is power 3 and lowering someone
## else's is power 4 but I can certainly change it.
##

##
## Again, if you can raise 'magic' on yourself, I don't see why you can't
## lower 'magic' on someone else (especially since if they select 'magic' it
## only lowers it by 6 as opposed to 33 if they selected fire/air/water/earth
## /life (which is less than 1/5th of doing one element). I will remove it
## if required but if I remove this one, I'll remove 'magic' from the raising
## one as well to keep it consistent.

##

## They take mana from both the caster and the partner - the code for that is
## in /d/Calia/guilds/elementalists/lay_cleric_soul.c (I did all of the spell
## routines in the layman soul - there isn't a layman branch, it's just where
## I coded the routines). Look for the 'esyndyasmos' routine.

##
## The code is in the lay_cleric_soul under the esyndyasmos routine. It checks to make sure
## that the caster has a partner set, that the partner is in the same room as the caster,
## that they are teamed with the partner, that both the caster and the partner have enough 
## mana to cast the spell, that both the caster and the partner have enough Chymos (conduit
## energy) stored to cast the spell, that both the caster and the partner aren't already 
## concentrating on something else (including spells being cast), that the caster hasn't
## already cast the spell and they aren't in cooldown, and that the caster is already in 
## combat. If all of those checks pass, it then removes the Chymos (conduit energy) from
## both the caster and the partner, it removes the mana from the partner, sets the flag
## that the caster has cast the spell (starts the cooldown) and then finally casts the
## appropriate spell.

>>>> Great! 

## 
## The 0.125% tax comes from the power 4 spell because:
## 1. Power level 4 spell = 0.500%
## 2. The spell requires two people to cast it (both are taxed for it) so tax is halved = 0.250%
## 3. The component cost is > 1gp so the tax is then minus 25% plus it has a second component
##    cost (Chymos) is a limited resource (gave it minus 25% for that) for a total of 50% = 0.125%
##

>>>> Okay. Can you add this formula to the tax_doc to avoid the question being asked
>>>> in the future if others review the guild?

## We can adjust this if necessary.
##

>>>> No, it just needs to be clear in the tax doc.

## Why can't this use an at-will? This gives it a built-in cooldown as opposed to having to 
## create one. This spell also only effects ONE target (the caster's current target), NOT 
## all targets in the room (unlike the other combo spells) so I'm not sure why it should
## use mass harm?

## a normal cast, 40 if they are in the racial guild. Sorry about that!

##
## Happy to discuss this too - I think we need a clear way to determine the number
## of targets and then adjust the CAID per target accordingly.
