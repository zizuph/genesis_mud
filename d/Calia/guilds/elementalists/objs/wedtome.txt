This tome will allow to perform a marriage ceremony in the garden
pavilion. Please ensure before you begin that all guests have arrived.
You should know the material type of the rings beforehand. If you do 
not, watch closely when they exchange them. Once that has all been 
done, this is what you will require:

Preparations:
- The male being married is the Groom, the female is the Bride.
- The person leading the ceremony is called the Priest/Priestess (P)
- The P should have the chalice and the bread from the sacristy.
- The person giving accompanyment to the Bride is refered to as the 
  Bride Blesser (BB).
- The person giving accompanyment to the Groom is refered to as the
  Groom Blesser (GB).
- The Bride and Groom should both have the rings to exchange with one
  another.
- The P, Bride and Groom should all be wearing the white robes.
- The P should also wear a mantle and alb.
- All participants should gather in the garden pavilion where the ceremony
  must take place.

Ceremony:
1 - The P formally welcomes all and announces/introduces the Bride and

     that they are accompanying the Bride and she has all of the
     blessings of her family).

    to my hand, my heart, and my spirit, to be my chosen one. To desire
    thee and be desired by thee, to possess thee, and be possessed by 
    thee, without shame, for naught can exist in the purity of 
    my love for thee. I promise to love thee wholly and completely 
    without restraint, in sickness and in health, in plenty and in 
    poverty, in life and beyond, where we shall meet, remember, and
