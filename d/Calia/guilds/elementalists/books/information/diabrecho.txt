Lord Diabrecho
Information about the Elemental of Water
Unknown
Lord Diabrecho, Elemental of Water, Lord of the Sea

Lord Diabrecho is distinguished by unfathomably deep and knowing
eyes, hair rich and flowing like the sea, and a body that is both
muscular and sleek.  He is the sage and wise philosopher who
speaks in a rich, deep voice like the rolling of the ocean waves.
Although he wields a great blue-green trident, he is not
particularily warlike.  He is the most intelligent and laconic of
the Elementals, and most likely the least threatening.
