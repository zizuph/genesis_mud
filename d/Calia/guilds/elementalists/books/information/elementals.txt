The Elementals

As everyone knows, the world is made of four elements: earth, air,
fire, and water.  The varying mixture of these elements makes stone,
wood, bread, wine, and even flesh and bone.  But the ancient Kyrulians
discovered that these elements were each created and governed by the
four Elementals, unimaginably powerful beings who created the world in
four days.  The short form of the creation story is traditionally told
this way:

          Lady Gu hewed a great stone from the limitless void that
          existed before the world was born, but the stone was without
          shape.  Lord Pyros ignited a great fire which melted the
          stone so that it could be shaped into mountains, plains, and
          valleys.  Lord Diabrecho cooled the stone by drenching it
          with water, so much that seas, lakes, and rivers remained
          long after the stone had cooled.  Lady Aeria saw that some
          bits of the great stone had been loosened in the shaping and
          the cooling, and she set them in motion with a gentle
          breath, starting the dance of life.

Unfortunately, most of the Kyrulians knowledge was lost in the
destruction of their walled city, which once commanded the summit of
Mount Kyrus.  Of their legendary library, their many rituals and
chants, and of their personal relationship with the Elementals, only a
few tales have been handed down to the present generation.  Most of
these concern the individual characteristics of the Elementals
themselves.
