The Fire Wand of Pyros

This wand connects the member to Pyros, the Elemental God of Fire.
The wand is comprised of a small wooden stick or dowel which is
straightened and smoothed, then coated in copper. The name of the
Elemental God of Fire must first be carved along the wand, followed by
the member's name. Once the Word of Power 'Ergon' is carved into it,
it shall grant it's member the use of the powers of Fire.
