The Chapel Altar

The Altar in the Chapel is where one may pray to the Elementals to
receive guidance from them.  It is also the place to betray them
if you decide you no longer wish to serve them, but be warned -
know the consequences before doing so.  You shall find another
book here on that topic.  If it is your intention to become one 
with the Elementals, then it is the chapel altar that you seek.
