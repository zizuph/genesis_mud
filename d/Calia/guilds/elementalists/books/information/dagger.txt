The Air Dagger of Aeria

This dagger connects the member to Aeria, the Elemental Goddess of
Air, and when properly enchanted grants the member power of the
very air itself. The dagger is comprised of a pure dagger or knife
which is washed, then it is coated in silver.  The name of the
Elemental Goddess of Air must first be carved along the hilt of
the dagger, followed by the member's name.  Once the Word of Power
'Egsousia' is carved into it, it shall grant its member the use of
the powers of Air.
