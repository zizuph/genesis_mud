Lady Aeria
Information about the Elemental of Air
Unknown
Lady Aeria, Elemental of Air, Ruler of the Skies

Lady Aeria is lovely beyond words, with long flowing golden
hair sparkling sky-blue eyes, and her comeliness is matched by
a sweet disposition.  Light-hearted and merry in character, free
in laughter, she speaks like a whisper of the wind with breath as
sweet as Spring, but she can blow a sudden and powerful gust when
she feels the need.  She wears a crown of clouds and is often
sighted with translucent butterfly-like wings.  While the most
agreeable and beautiful of the Elementals, she can be flighty,
unpredictable, and a danger if perturbed.
