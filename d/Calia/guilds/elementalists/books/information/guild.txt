Guild Information
As a member of the Elemental Worshippers, you will be offered training
in communing with the Elementals and mastering the powers gifted to
you by the Elementals. We have no racial restrictions, nor any
alignment restrictions, but do not be fooled into thinking that we
haven't any rules.  You shall be expected to honour and respect all
members of this clerical circle, no matter their race or alignment.
You shall also ensure there is no bloodshed inside the Elemental
Temple.  No member shall ever take the life of another, for if they
try, the punishment shall be severe.

If you are interested in joining our circle, enter the chapel south
of here, and pray to the Elementals there.
