The Water Chalice of Diabrecho

The Water Chalice of Diabrecho

This chalice connects the member to Diabrecho, the Elemental God
of Water, and when properly enchanted grants the member the power
to control the fluids of the body.  The chalice is comprised of a
glass or chalice which is repaired of all imperfections and
washed, then coated in gold.  The name of the Elemental God of
Water must first be carved on the outer lip of the chalice,
followed by the member's name.  Once the Word of Power 'Meizon' is
carved onto it, it shall grant its member the use of the powers
of Water.
