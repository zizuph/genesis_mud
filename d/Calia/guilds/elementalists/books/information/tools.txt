Sacred Elemental Tools

There are four sacred items that each member must construct.  These
are known as the Elemental Tools.  Each one represents a link to a
certain Elemental and its power.  Each member will carve three words
into each Tool.  The first shall be the God or Goddess of the element,
which will enchant the Tool with the power of the element.  The second
will be the name of the member, which will transfer the energies of
the element into the member.  The third will be a Word of Power (a
different one for each Tool), which will activate the Tool with the
powers of that element.

To construct these Elemental Tools, the members shall have to gather
the necessary items, then visit the western chamber of the temple to
forge them.  Once properly forged, the God/Goddesses name shall be
carved as well as the members name.  The Words of Power shall only be
carved when each member is ready.  They will receive a vision when
they have reached enlightenment and are ready to carve these Words
onto the Tools.  If the member has been given permission by another,
they may then use the carving chamber again to carve these Words into
their Tools.

The four Elemental Tools are the Fire Wand, Water Chalice, Air Dagger,
and the Earth Pentacle.
