The Earth Pentacle of Gu

This pentacle connects the member to Gu, the Elemental Goddess of
Earth. The pentacle is comprised of a small plate or shallow bowl
which is smoothed, washed, a pentagram is carved in the centre on the
inside face, then it is coated in platinum.  The name of the Elemental
Goddess of Earth must first be carved along the outside edge of the
pentacle, followed by the member's name.  Once the Word of Power
'Ischuroteros' is carved into it, it shall grant its member the use of
the powers of Earth.
