      You shall need to construct the Staff of Psuchae in order to 
      visit me in my realm. To do this, you shall require a black 
      diamond and a staff or stick. These items you shall have to
      bring to the holy temple where you will bathe them both in 
      the fires of the Great Hall to purify them. DO NOT USE ANY OF
      THE STAVES I HAVE GIVEN YOU. You shall need those and if you 
      use any of them, you shall not be able to retrieve another,
      ever. This is your only warning about this. Once they are
      both purified, you shall proceed into the chamber north of 
      the Great Hall which is known as the Ritual Chamber. This is
      the only time you shall be allowed into this chamber so make
      sure you perform the following ritual properly:

      1. You shall enter the pentagram that is on the floor.
      2. You shall now insert the black diamond into the indentation.
      3. You shall place the staff or stick into the pentagram.
      4. You shall light the candles surrounding the pentagram.
      5. You shall create Psuchaestaff.
      6. You shall leave the pentagram.

      Once you have performed the above steps, you shall have the Staff
      of Psuchae. You shall now have all five of the Elemental Staves.
      Now find the obelisks in the moorlands of Calia. Here you shall 
      insert the appropriate staves into the proper obelisks. Make sure
      you have sufficient time to insert ALL OF THE STAVES at one time.
      If you quit in the middle of placing these staves, you will NOT
      be able to finish this task. This is your ONLY warning. Once 
      the Staves of Fire, Wind, Earth and Water have been inserted, 
      another obelisk shall rise from the ground at the designated
      spot. Find this spot and insert the final staff into this newly
      risen obelisk. These five obelisks shall form a pattern. Find the
      centre and pray to me. Your new life shall begin after doing so.
