                 Initiation to the Spirit Circle
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Preparations:
- The person being initiated is called the Enlightened.
- The person leading the ceremony is called the Primary Member (PM)
- The person sponsoring the Enlightened is/are called the Mentor (M)
- All participants should be wearing white robes, especially the
  PM, M and Enlightened.
- The PM and the M may wear a mantle and alb.
- The PM must carry a quantity of incense (two or three is a good idea).
- All participants should gather in the chapel where the ceremony
  must take place.
- NOTE: Once the ceremony has begun (the incense is loaded), the chapel
  doors will be locked to all non-members, and will not unlock until
  the incense burns out.
 
Ceremony:
1  The PM informally welcomes all and announces/introduces the Enlightened.
2  The PM starts the incense with the command 'load incense'. It will
   start to burn immediately, but will take a while to fill the room,
   which must happen before the rest of the ceremony.
3  The PM asks the Enlightened to affirm his/her willingness to abide by
   the objectives of the Circle ("I do" type of deal)
4  The PM asks the Enlightened to kneel before the altar.
5  The PM asks "Who will mentor the Enlightened?"
6  The M answers "I do" and lays his/her hands on the Enlightened with the
   command 'lay hands on <Enlightened>'.
7  The M uses the command 'schoose <Enlightened>'. 
8  The PM does likewise. Any other members present may do likewise now, if
   they choose or the PM deems it necessary or wanted.
9  The PM anoints the Enlightened with oil by doing the command 'anoint 
   <Enlightened>'.
10 The PM asks the Enlightened to 'pray to Psuchae'.
11 The Enlightened should now rise and give the PM back the robe. The 
   Enlightened has been told (by a voice in their head) to seek out Psuchae
   in the Ancient City. If they cannot figure it out, give them hints to 
   seek Psuchae in Thalassia.
12 The Enlightened shall begin their quest. Once completed, they shall be
   a member of the Spirit Circle.
