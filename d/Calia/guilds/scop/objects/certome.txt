------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Promotion to Archon or Patriarch/Matriarch, or Council.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Preparations:
- The person being promoted is called the Member.
- The person leading the ceremony is called the Primary Member (PM)
- The person(s) sponsoring the Member is/are called the Sponsors (SP)
  (The PM is also an SP if only two members are available)
- All participants should be wearing white robes, especially the
  PM, SP and Member.
- The PM and the SP may wear a mantle and alb.
- The new ranking to be given to the Member during the ceremony
  should be determined AHEAD of time.
- The PM must carry a quantity of incense (two or three is a good idea).
- All participants should gather in the chapel where the ceremony
  must take place.
- NOTE: Once the ceremony has begun (the incense is loaded), the chapel
  doors will be locked to all non-members, and will not unlock until
  the incense burns out.
 
Ceremony:
1  The PM informally welcomes all and announces/introduces the Member
2  The PM starts the incense with the command 'load incense'. It will
   start to burn immediately, but will take a while to fill the room,
   which must happen before the rest of the ceremony.
3  The PM asks the Member to affirm his/her willingness to abide by
   the objectives of the Circle in their new rank ("I do" type of deal)
4  The PM asks "Who will sponsor this Member?"
5  The SP answers "I do" and lays his/her hands on the Member with the
   command 'lay hands on <Member>'. 
6  The second SP or the PM (if only one Sp) does likewise. Any other
   members present may do likewise now, if they choose or the PM deems
   it necessary or wanted.
7  The PM anoints the Member with oil by doing the command 'anoint 
   <Member>'.
8  The PM announces the promotion with something like "With your pledge
   of fidelity and the support of those present, I promote you to the
   rank of <Title>"
9  The PM promotes the Member with the command 'promote <member> <Title>'
   Note the title should be capitalized. A list of 'official' titles are
   listed below. 
   For example: 'promote jaacar Archon' or 'promote jaacar Patriarch'
