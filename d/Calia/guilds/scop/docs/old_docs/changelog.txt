A log of functional changes made to the Spirit Circle guild. For
reference by balance and other interested parties. Started April 25,
2004.

25/4/2004:
-Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/therapeaou.c. (heal spell)
 Made it so that the component (a pearl) is only consumed one in ten
 castings. Changed the formula for determining how many hit points
 are healed, removing hard cap at 600 points, instead giving
 diminishing returns beyond that point. 

-Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/specials/spiritshadow.c (occ shadow)
 The query_casting_bonus function there is rather useless. It's
 currently only used to make spells slightly easier to cast as the
 number of spells you cast grows, to the maximum of -100 to the task
 if you had 250.000 spells cast. I changed it so that it produces a 
 result useful in calculating spell effectiveness: a number from 0 to
 200 based on number of spells cast, and not requiring such huge 
 amounts of spells cast to make a difference.

-Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/giatreou.c (cleanse spell)
 The component (yellow topaz) is now only consumed 3 times out of 10.
 Changed the effectiveness formula to use query_casting_bonus, as 
 above.

26/4/2004:
-Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/apergo.c (soul strike)
 This harm spell has been changed quite a bit. It doesn't work on 
 the undead, it only works on evil targets. It deals about 200-500
 damage, with 0-400 bonus damage depending on how evil the target 
 is. The ruby component is only used up one in ten times.

29/4/2004:
-Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/vekpos.c (turn undead)
 Added files: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/fear_shadow.c
              ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/feared_shadow.c
              ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/vekpos_ob.c
This spell made an undead creature simply flee before. By adding shadows
I made sure the targets would continue to flee when encountering the 
caster again. Also, for weak or low-health undeads, there's a chance a
casting of this spell will outright destroy them.

~Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/skiamorfi.c (shadow form)
            ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/skiamorfi_obj.c
            ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/skiamorfi_shadow.c
This spell was merely a disguise spell, obscuring the caster's 
description and making him unknown to player who would otherwise
know him. It sucked 25 mana every 100 seconds for this benefit. 
I reduced the mana-suckage to 25 every 180 seconds. Also, it 
modifies their combat skills: +25 each defence and parry, -25
club (their only combat skill and the only weapon they're permitted
to use). If they're very successful in casting the spell, they get
a damage shield - implemented in the shadow as 25% of all attacks
missing them through redefinition of query_not_attack_me. If they're 
extremely successful, they also get 25 points of magic resistance.

05/5/2004:
-Change to: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/sfyri.c (spiritual hammer)
            ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/sfyri_ob.c
This spell used to be a weak bolt spell, representing the caster 
throwing a "spiritual hammer" at the target. The updated spell instead
produces this hammer, as a holdable object, and lets the caster use it
at regular intervals in combat, as long as he's holding it. You use it
by throwing it, causing some damage to the opponent - it's not a regular
melee weapon. It starts out very weak at 100 pen, then grows as the
caster uses it. The soft cap is at 600, from then on it grows really slowly.
Undead get 50% more damage. For each throw there is a constant chance of 
breakage equal to .5%. Doubled the mana cost to 100, kept the component
as-is.

-Later same day, same spell: Adjusted a bit, it was too good a deal. Double
chance of breakage, slower growth.

06/5/2004:
-Change to the above spell. Downgraded again. Soft cap adjusted downwards to
500, slower recycle, higher breakage chance, now drains fatigue and mana to
throw. 

19/5/2004:
~Change to Sfyri again. The hammer now has an increasing chance of breakage 
with use. Lower at first, then increasing as the hammer gets better. Also 
doubled chance of a critical hit (doing double damage) from 0.5% to 1%.

09/6/2004:
~Created a new spell: Oneiro. Doc can be found in 
 ~Calia/private/spells/scop/ONEIRO. Put it at 1% tax for the time being.

-Later, same day: Change to Siopi (silence) spell. Gem component now survives
70% of the time.

-Later, same day: Anagnorizo. Component changed from black diamond to 
moonstone. Removed paralysis/hp loss upon casting.

-Later, same day: Skiamati, changes in both spell and spell object. Gave it a
60% chance to have the gem survive, and upped LIVE_I_SEE_DARK and potential 
LIVE_I_SEE_INVIS to 10 levels each. 

17/6/2004:
-Did some changes to Skiamorfi : ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/skiamorfi.c
			         ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/skiamorfi_obj.c
				 ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/skiamorfi_shadow.c
Now, if the casting of the spell is rather succesful, the caster gains the
ability to radiate light or darkness at a cost of 30 mana a pop. One level is
generated and lasts for five minutes. No more than 5 levels in each direction
can be stacked. Also, the damage shield that gives a 25% damage shield for a
rather succesful casting, now becomes a 40% damage shield if the casting was
extremely succesful.

26/7/2004: 
-Did some changes to Anakalo: ~Calia/guilds/scop/spells/anakalo.c
The location you memorize now saves over armageddon. If you use the 'temple'
argument to it, you can now cast it in combat to escape. Using the 'travel'
argument you'll go to your memorized location, that does not work in combat 
though. Also, using 'travel' takes more time(7 secs).
-As per Tilorops request, did various changes. Skiamorfi will now at most 
help you evade 33% of incoming hits. Giatreou (cure poison) now takes 5 secs
rather than 3. Apergo (damage evil creatures) is now capped at 800 damage and
casting time upped by a second to 4. Therapeaou (heal) used to cast in 2 secs,
now it casts in 3.
