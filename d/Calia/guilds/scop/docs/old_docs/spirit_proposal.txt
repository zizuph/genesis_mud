Proposal for spells and training for the Spirit Circle of Psuchae.

  This will not be a fully detailed proposal for the guild. I have
included rough mana costs, effects and duration of the spells or
spell components. These things will require balancing as the spells
themselves are created and tested. I will try to give an estimation
for each.

Apprentice Level Spells:
========================

Level 1:
Spirit Talk -      Tell line spell, can contact anyone present (and not
                   a wizard, or invisible, or linkdead) in the realms.
                   It will not initiate combat. It may be cast in combat.
                   No component required. 10 mana.
Detect Alignment - This will give an approximation of the alignment
                   of the target. It will not start combat. It cannot
                   be cast in combat. This will require a skull. 15 mana.
Identify Magic -   This will give the caster information about the
                   magical properties of an item that it is cast upon.
                   It will not initiate combat. It cannot be cast in 
                   combat. This will require a rib and thighbone. 15
                   mana.
Light -            Your standard garden variety light spell, two levels
                   of light when it is cast and it cannot be stacked. 
                   It will not initiate combat. It can be cast in
                   combat. Requires a quartz. 20 mana. Duration maximum
                   is 600.
Synithis -         This spell will summon a familar that the guild
                   member will be able to speak through, since guild
                   members won't be able to talk normally at all (when
                   they join the guild, they have their tongues 
                   magically removed).
                   The familiar cannot carry things, nor can it attack
                   for the caster or take hits. It will not initiate
                   combat. It can be cast in combat. Requires a rib and
                   intestines. 20 mana. Lasts max 600.

Level 2:
Silence -          The target will get the LIVE_M_MOUTH_BLOCKED added
                   to them. They will not be able to speak for a 
                   variable duration depending on guild_stat and spell
                   skills (between 60 and 300 seconds). This spell will
                   not initiate combat and will be able to be cast 
                   during battle. Requires an onyx. 25 mana. 
Name Forget -      This spell will erase the memory of the caster's 
                   name from the target, causing them to no longer
                   "know" the caster and to have forgotten them. This
                   will not initiate combat. It will not be able to be
                   cast in combat. Requires an amber. 25 mana.

Level 3:
Peace -            This will stop the fighting in a room. If the enemies
                   are auto-attackers (aggressive), they may re-attack
                   immediately if they wish to do so. This spell will be
                   able to be cast in combat (obviously) and will NOT
                   initiate combat (obviously again). Requires a
                   carnelian. 40 mana.
Shadow Form -      This spell will turn the caster into a shadowy form.
                   This form will conceal their identities (unless
                   they introduce themselves again) until which time
                   they either run out of mana or dispel the effects.
                   It continuously takes mana from the player to
                   remain in this form. Players can attack and be
                   attacked as normal in this form (they do not get
                   any special abilities other than emotes). This spell
                   cannot be cast in combat and will not initiate
                   combat. Requires a pre-made component (can only be
                   created in the guildhome) consisting of amber and
                   cranberry. 100 mana. Lasts until the caster runs
                   out of mana (taking 25 mana every 100 seconds).


Master Member Level Spells:
===========================

Level 4:
Cure Wounds -      This will be a fairly powerful healing spell. The 
                   amount healed will depend on guild_stat and spell
                   skills. This spell will be able to be cast upon
                   themselves, or others that they choose to heal 
                   (including npcs if they so choose). It may be cast
                   in combat. It will not initiate combat. Requires a
                   pearl. 100 mana. Min healed is 100, max is 600.
Neutralize Poison- This spell will attempt to cure the target of poison.
                   The chances of being successful will depend upon the
                   type of poison, the guild_stat of the caster and
                   the spell skills of the caster. It will not initiate
                   combat. It can be cast in combat. Requires a yellow
                   topaz. 100 mana. Max strength to remove poison is
                   200 (MIN(200, query_casting_success(caster) * 2)).

Level 5:
Shadow Eyes -      This will allow the caster to see in the dark and
                   possibly even have the ability to see invisible
                   people. The chances of it allowing the player to
                   see invisible players will depend on their guildstat
                   and spell skills. It will not initiate combat and
                   cannot be cast in combat. Requires alexandrite. 70
                   mana. 20% chance to see invisible. Max time is 600.

Level 6:
Soul Strike -      This spell will cause damage to the target with a maximum
                   pen of 405 (minimum 100) unless the target is undead, then
                   the maximum pen is 526 (30% bonus). Requires a ruby. 100 mana. 
                   This spell is available to all level 3 Master members (guild 
                   level 6) and higher guild members.
Word of Recall -   This spell will be a two-part spell. A player will be
                   able to place a marker in a place and then later be
                   able to teleport back to that place. This spell has
                   the most room for abuse since a player could cast the
                   spell in a treasure room of some sort and teleport
                   back to it at any time. I will have it check for the
                   ROOM_M_NO_TELEPORT and ROOM_M_NO_TELEPORT_TO 
                   properties. I will also keep a log of rooms that they
                   teleport to and any that I find to be being abused, 
                   I will report to the appropriate domains so that the
                   property can be added to that room. This spell will
                   not initiate attack and cannot be cast during combat.
                   Requires a pre-made component (can only be made in the
                   guildhome) consisting of chalcedony and breadroot. 
                   100 mana. NOTE: This spell requires the component for
                   both the marking and teleporting phase. The player 
                   can also specify 'temple' as a target. If they do this,
                   they will be transported to the garden outside of their
                   guild home.        
 
Level 7:
True Identity -    This will reveal the name of the target. It will only
                   work on other players, NOT npcs. This spell will then
                   allow the caster to remember that player as if they
                   had been introduced to them (if they have enough slots
                   in their memory to do so). The caster will have to
                   manually remember the target. This spell will not
                   start combat and cannot be cast during combat.
                   Requires an amber. 100 mana.


Elder Level Spells:
===================

Level 8:
Convert Weapon -   This will turn the target of the spell (a weapon) 
                   into a staff (club with bludgeoning damage) with
                   75% of the original hit and pen of the weapon.
                   The weapon cannot be sold, nor will it save past
                   armageddon. It can still break like regular weapons.
                   This spell will not initiate combat and cannot be
                   used during combat. Requires a pre-made component (can
                   only be made in the guildhome) consisting of red
                   spinel and sargassum. 200 mana.
Energy Drain -     This spell will drain hit points (life force) from
                   an enemy and transfer a portion of them back to 
                   the caster. The amount drained and the amount 
                   returned back to the caster will be determined by
                   guildstat, spell skills and target resistance. This
                   will initiate combat and can be cast during combat.
                   Requires a pre-made component (can only be made in
                   the guildhome) consisting of sapphire and sea bubble.
                   175 mana. Max drain is 20% of the target's HPs, 50% 
                   of that amount are given back to the caster.

   Members will have to divine for their spells upon login, they will not 
automatically have them all. Depending on their stature (level) in the 
guild, they will be restricted to the number of spells they can have as well. 
Only someone of the highest rank in the guild will be able to have all of the 
spells.  

   The guild members will not be allowed to drink alcohol at all. If 
they do, their spells won't work. The players will have their tongues
removed magically to join the guild (the ultimate vow of silence), 
meaning they will not be able to speak (say, shout, ponder, think,
rsay, no type of speech whatsoever) except through the use of
a summoned familiar (each time they speak through it, they will 
take damage and use mana). A note on the speaking restriction, I am adding 
the ability to speak through either a familiar simply because there are 
many quests, shopkeepers, etc... that have been coded where one has to be 
able to speak, thus making it impossible for a member to do these things. 
When they do speak, they will take considerable damage and
pay alot of mana to do so (25 mana and 25 HPs each time they speak 
through the familiar). The members will have a telepathic speech that
they can use on each other without penalty, but nobody else in the room
(except wizards and other guild members) will see it.

   The guild house (a temple) will have a post office, storage room for
weapons and armours (rack, will not save over armageddon), a library, a
refectory (place to eat and drink), a components room , and
various other rooms.

   This will guild will take both the players occupational and layman 
guild slots. It will require total dedication to worship Psuchae, not 
to mention it would be very difficult to function in any other guild
with no tongue (no ability to speak).
