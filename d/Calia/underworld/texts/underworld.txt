						Background for the Underworld
			(based on the original concept by Maniac in 1995)
			=================================================

Kroug was a master of black magic but had particular talents for mind
manipulation, shape-shifting and demon mastery. He had diverted much
of his efforts into releasing and controlling demons as assassins to aid 
his kroug forces, since he knew that krougs alone were not enough to be sure 
of defeating the Calians. He had opened a secret rift in the south side of the 
foothills of Mount Kyrus. This rift is basically a crack in the earth that is
the physical gateway to a treacherous demonic underworld that has remained
locked away since primeval times. The rift is covered by a huge slab of 
stone, which is hidden under a layer of soil, so that someone will
have to have high awareness to spot something strange there. They will then
have to clear the soil from the surface, and get a team of players together    
to slide the stone along the ground to reveal the rift that lies beneath. 
The stone should magically slide back and a layer of earth magically cover
it not long after it has been moved, as Kroug had placed a spell on it to
keep it secret. Entering the rift means sliding down a sharply inclined shaft
of earth for a couple of hundred feet, and landing in a tunnel that is on 
the first level of the underworld.

Dephonia was known as the Goddess of Evil to most in Argos. Kretos was the
son of a high-ranking military official of Argos. Both were expelled out
of Argos and had found each other while Dephonia was having her temple built.
They too were masters in the art of black magic and had heard rumours of
underground tunnels where demons lived. Together they opened an enrance into 
the first level of the underworld in the basement of the Dephonian Temple. 
Currently the stairs leading down to this area are closed off (too dangerous 
to use), however this would be changed to be open into a small basement area 
that has an entrance into the first level of the underworld (or exit from it) 
as well.

The underworld is made up of a number of levels, each of which is has an 
entrance gateway protected by a magical seal of some sort, that must be 
breached in order to pass. The exception to this is the first level, which 
was guarded by the stone slab hundreds of feet above.

So, what is a magical seal? Basically, it's a spell placed on a gate that 
only allows someone to enter who is either a more powerful magic user
(i.e. can overpower the spell), or someone has done something special, for
instance someone might have to sacrifice a pint of their blood and smear it 
on the door (let's get demonic here - this could do some serious hp damage too),
say a series of holy words backwards in disrespect, drink a special kind 
of poison, pull the right combination of levers on some mechanism (which could
result in a nasty fate if one gets it wrong, getting worse the more times it
happens). Things like the holy words backwards and the levers could be made
different for each player, so that it's harder to cheat. 

But how should a player find out what has to be done to get past a certain 
seal? Well, clues have to be given, which I guess can be done in many ways, 
like wall paintings, the tattered remains of books, and should always be hard 
to find and cryptic where possible. How to strike the right level of 
difficulty is the challenge of course, but it should get more difficult at 
each level. 

Ideally when a seal is successfully breached the gateway should only open 
briefly to let the players through and the seals can magicaly close again.
The player could open the seal each time they pass through (having already
completed the task of opening it in the first place), but could not lead
others through the seal - each player would have to have opened the seal
on their own.
 
Kroug, Dephonia and Kretos could of course pass through the seals,
and had gone down quite deep, and managed to bring under their control 
many of the demons they has found there. 

Each level of the underworld could consist of a set of confusing winding 
passages, and each one could effectively be a self-contained mini-quest 
(or quest stage) containing all the clues/items to find the way past the
next seal. 

Different artifacts and glyphs could also be found here for the Elementalist
Clerics guild. These artifacts and glyphs could be brought back to their
Temple to do things like empower their elemental form prayer to be a different
form or change their summoned familiar to other forms, depending on the artifact
or glyph that was retrieved from there and returned.
