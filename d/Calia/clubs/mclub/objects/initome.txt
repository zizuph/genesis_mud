           Initiation into the Quondam Mistici Society
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
- A seeker must be sponsored by at least two current members.
- At least two sponsors (preferably three) must participate in the
  ceremony.
 
Preparations:
- The person being initiated is called the Seeker.
- The person leading the ceremony is called the Primary Initiator (PI)
- The person(s) sponsoring the Seeker is/are called the Sponsors (Sp)
  (The PI is also a Sp if only two members are available)
- All participants should be wearing white robes, especially the
  PI, Sp and Seeker.
- The PI may wear a mantle and alb, and the Sp a mantle
- The society title to be given to the Seeker during the ceremony
  should be determined AHEAD of time.
- The PI must carry a quantity of incense.
- All participants should gather in the sanctuary where the ceremony
  must take place.
 
Ceremony:
1 The PI informally welcomes all and announces/introduces the Seeker
2 The PI starts the incense with the command 'load incense'. It will
  sburn immediately, but will take a while to fill the room, which
  must happen before the laying on of hands.
3 The PI instructs the seeker in the objectives of the society, which
  are to perpetuate the bond of friendship amongst those of the former
  arcane faith, and to preserve the memory of the Ancient Mystic Order
  for posterity.
4 The PI asks the Seeker to affirm his/her willingness to abide by
  the objectives of the society ("I do" type of deal)
5 The PI asks "Who sponsors this seeker"
6 The Sp answers "I do" and lays his/her hands on the seeker with the
  command 'lay hands on <seeker>'. Any other members present may do
  likewise if they choose.
7 The second Sp or the PI (if only one Sp) does likewise.
8 The PI announces the induction with something like "With your pledge
  of fidelity and the support of those present, I induct you into
  the Society of Quondam Mistici"
9 The PI inducts the Seeker with the command 'induct <seeker> <title>'
  Note the title should fit in the sentence "He is ___________"
  For example: 'induct zima a Quondam Mystic Cantor' or 'induct mumon
               the Dictator of the Club'

Summary of necessary commands:
'load censor'              (must have incense)
'lay hands on <seeker>'    ex: 'lay hands on digit'
'induct <seeker> <title>'  ex: 'induct digit a Quondam Mystic Acolyte'
                               'induct digit the Eternal Majesty'
