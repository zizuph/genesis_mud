Laws of Telberin

Our fair city does welcome visitors.  We only ask you follow a few simple 
rules to maintain our pristine state, most well suited for our Royal 
Personage, and the general Constitution of our Elves.

Respect our Noble Paladins and other Guards, they are there to help you.

If thy soul be dark, leave the darkness at the gates, that you may come (and 
go) in peace.  Violence will not be tolerated in the city limits!

No unseemly bodily functions in the city limits.  Our streetsweepers work 
hard enough already!

Enter the Tower of Puzzles at your own risk.  Though our general wish is for 
the weal of visitors, if you expose yourself to such danger, we cannot 
guarantee your safety.

If thee have questions concerning our Realm, you may ask any available 
Wildrunner to assist you.  These noble and free elven souls do come and go as 
they wish, but all share a love of the glorious domain that is Telberin.
