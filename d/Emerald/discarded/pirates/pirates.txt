The scroll says:

We the Devil's Pirates dedicate our lives to the service of
his majesty, Lord Diablo. We follow the path set out for us
by the great Mishrak the Pirate. A life of cruelty and 
deceit, of looting and pillaging, of stealing and corruption
is what awaits you if you decide to take the vow of piracy.
We only require that you display your desire to join by
performing a simple little test: finding the treasure of
Mishrak, the greatest pirate who ever lived, and our founder.

If you join the Pirates and later wish to leave the guild you will
have to pay the price of your disloyalty with your life and your
skills above superior layman.

The guild tax is currently 15%

Trading             Pick Pocket
