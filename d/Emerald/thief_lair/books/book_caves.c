You study the book of caves.
The caves of Emerald are some of the most interesting places to visit in the 
whole of the world. They were first discovered by the prehistoric humans that
first set up their homes in them. There are cave paintings to prove that the
caves were inhabited by primitive cave-folk. Later on, Goblins moved into the
lower parts of the caves, and claimed this place as their own. They even set
up a guild to promote the brotherhood of Goblins. More recently, the thieves
of Emerald were hunted down by the ordinary people of Emerald, and thus they
took refuge in the caves. From here, their secure base, they can safely plan
the next great robbery. It has been suggested that these thieves are working
in collaboration with the thieves of Kalad. However, Emerald is not a good
haven for the thieves: they have to employ the local Ogre population as guards
to keep the ordinary folk of Emerald at bay. In return the Ogres get a share
of the loot that the thieves steal, mainly in the form of weapons and armour.
It is a somewhat fragile alliance though, and it would not take much for one
of the two groups to betray the other.
One final rumor about these caves: it is common in local folk-lore that a
great and powerful mage, named Enzalcaspin, once inhabited these caves. It's
not certain whether this man ever existed, and no-one has ever found a place
in these caves where he could have lived.
