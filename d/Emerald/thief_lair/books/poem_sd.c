        A summer dream
        --------------
 
        It's night. The sky is black velvet,
        pin-pricked with light.
        So warm. The sweet summer air
        of a freshly cut lawn.
        She's here. The girl you love
        has appeared.
 
        You're free. You rocket up
        high over the seas.
        You fly. Spinning past stars as
        you streak through the sky.
        You're fast. The whole of the universe
        within your grasp.
 
        You embrace. You form one
        as you hurtle through space.
        You kiss. Nothing can spoil
        your mutual bliss.
        So fine. The ecstacy you feel,
        so divine.
 
        Time slows. The love that you
        share grows.
        At last. The heat of passion
        is passed.
        You fall. Back to the familiar
        blue and white ball.
 
        So far. You plummet downwards,
        a shooting star.
        You land. Your lover lets
        go of your hand.
        She leaves. Fulfilment resounds
        from the sigh she heaves.
 
        You wake. You didn't want
        the dream to break.
        The light. That's something
        you cannot fight.
        Take heart. Soon, another
        night will start.
