You turn to the chapter titled 'Colours'.
To make sure you are recognised on the battlefield, it is most important
that your coat of arms is painted in bold, bright colours. The basic shield
consists of one simple design, as decribed in the 'Ordinaries' chapter.
The general rule of heraldry states that a colour may not be placed on another
colour, and a metal may not be placed on another metal. There are only two 
metals, and five colours in common use.
The metals are: or (gold / yellow); and argent (silver / white).
The colours are: gules (red); azure (blue); vert (green); purpure (brown);
and finally, sable (black).
This means, for example, that a gules (red) cross on an argent (silver)
background is okay, but a sable (black) cross on a purpure (brown) background
is out of the question.
The reason for this rule is simple: the coat of arms must be distinguishable
from a long distance, and this is not the case with the sable / purpure shield
mentioned above. Thus, only combinations of one metal and one colour lead to
a shield that fulfils the requirements of the rule.
