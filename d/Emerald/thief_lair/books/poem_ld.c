        A legal diversion for the night
        -------------------------------
 
        The sacred water filled the room,
        floating like a waiting tomb,
        to claim it's willing victim's souls,
        and fill it's tempting vacant holes.
        Slowly it uncoils it's wrath,
        inviting all to take a bath,
        to free your world from earthly things,
        transmuting men to fearless kings.
 
        Careless of the risks they take,
        unwary of the gifts they fake,
        all who drink the bless'ed booze
        inevitably have to lose.
        The warnings there for all to see,
        the statement of it's costly fee;
        and yet we always seem to find
        that all of us are largely blind.
