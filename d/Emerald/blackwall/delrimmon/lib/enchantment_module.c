 *  Borgil, being a trained practitioner of certain magical arts from
 *  his studies in Telberin, placed on his belongings an enchantment
 *  to protect himself from thievery. This module can be inherited by
 *  things on his corpse, and prevent people from walking off with them,
 *  though it allows them to remove them briefly from his (dead) person.
