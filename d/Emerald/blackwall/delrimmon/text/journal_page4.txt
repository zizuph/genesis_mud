This is most strange! I have discovered the northern outpost, as was indicated
on the map from the city. However, there is darkness within! I have seen no

just above that chamber on the outside cliffs. I will look forward to spending
the day deciphering these pieces to the puzzle.

Oh fates of darkness! The earthquake struck just as I stood beside the
signal horn. I could not keep my balance, and tumbled back down into the
emblem chamber where I have broken my leg and my shoulder as well. I cannot
climb back up the ladder. Worse, the stone door has been cracked, and the
enchantment dispelled.
