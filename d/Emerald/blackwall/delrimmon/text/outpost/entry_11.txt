Day 223:

The mood of the soldiers is troubled, and I cannot claim to be immune to
worry myself with the strange events of late. Soon after my last report, we
sent our first group of soldiers back to the City to be replaced with fresh
faces. The effect on the dynamics of training has been unfortunate, and now
there is a much greater sense of competition and the need to prove one's
worthiness in the valley. Islin, still our finest warrior, found the
competitiveness completely repellent, and has retreated even further into his
own doings when the training is not in session. Ten days ago, the Signal horn
was sounded, and yet the pattern was not one of those we have memorized. It
was discovered to be Islin who blew the thing without orders. To my
astonishment, Formandil overrode the disciplinary action I chose for a penalty
on Islin, and instead insisted that he himself would carry out punitive
measures. I have no idea what he had in mind for Islin, but not two days later,
the Signal was again blown, this time with a very long and complex pattern
of notes. To the astonishment of all the entire valley was filled with a
most brilliant illumination. Never have my eyes beheld anything of the like.
Islin was again the culprit, but in the confusion of the strange light, I was
unable to speak to him about it. When the light left the valley, Islin was
nowhere to be found, and has not returned since that time. What madness has
taken him, I have no idea. Formandil and Maeltar, though concerned about the
effect this has had upon the troops, assure us that all is well, and that
we must continue with our training.
