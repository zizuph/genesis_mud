Day 25:

Our work has gone well, and faster even than I had expected. Maeltar has joined
us here, and I have discovered that he and Formandil had been making
preparations to this valley long before we arrived. Four key locations were
established prior to our arrival, and we have built upon them in our general
fortification of the area. In addition to this southern outpost at the pass,
another stands along the upper reaches of the western cliffs near to the
waterfall which feeds the lake. The large cave near to the foot of the falls
will provide an excellent barracks for our troops once we have delved further
into its depths to create our bunks. I suspect that will be our key staging
area. Its central location is ideal, and I like the fact that it is located
close to the pool which will serve as our secret supply stores.
