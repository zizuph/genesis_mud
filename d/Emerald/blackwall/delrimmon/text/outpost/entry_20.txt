Day 450:

Formandil and Maeltar have stumbled upon what they believe will be a
decisive blow to the forces of Darkness. A large group of Ogres and Orcs
have been spotted on the northwestern plains. Within their camp are no
less than twenty Darklings - more than have ever been spotted in the
same place at one time. Tomorrow, we will march against them, with the
idea that if we destroy such a large number of the Darklings, that we will
remove nearly all hope that the forces of Darkness will ever be able to
rise again in Emerald. To ensure the success of this mission, all eight
of the Torque-wearers will ride in the vanguard, leading over half of the
troops stationed here at Del Rimmon. This large scale attack will mark
the largest maneuver that we have employed since our time here. I look
forward to seeing our forces put to the test. I sense that a great victory
is at hand!
