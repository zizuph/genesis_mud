Day 252:

All is clear to me now, and I am grateful to Formandil and Maeltar for their
belief in me, and their patience with my former doubts regarding matters. I
have joined Islin as a Torque-wearer, and am now quite assured of the 
great importance of this operation, and my place within it. Islin has done
well in sustaining the quality of the exercises in my absence, and I now
reassume my position as training officer. I have discussed my earlier entries
in this log with Maeltar, who believes that they do not constitute a threat to
our purposes, and so I shall leave them unchanged for matters of posterity.
