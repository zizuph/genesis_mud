Day 300:

We have been active at this outpost for a full 300 days now. Formandil and
Maeltar are pleased to see their designs coming to fruition. In the past
fifty days, the ranks of the Torque-wearers have increased by three. Randil,
Locrael, and Vidmin have completed the test, and a fourth, Selvic, began it
just yesterday. All four are worthy recipients, and I trust that they will
serve Emerald well. Training in the valley has risen to a new level, and all
ill feelings have subsided. I see great things for the future of Telberin as
a result of our work here.
