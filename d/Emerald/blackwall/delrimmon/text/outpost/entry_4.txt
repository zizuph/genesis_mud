Day 74:

The barracks are complete, and at last we can enjoy shelter when we wish for
sleep. I have cleared an area of the forest along the western shores for
exercises and the like, though I fear it shall yet be a full score of days
before any training can begin. Though Formandil has not returned from the
City, the first caravan has come laden with catapult gear. We will be spending
the next few days piecing together our first along the ledge, and making
sure we have it properly assembled. I am still amazed that these weapons have
been brought here!
