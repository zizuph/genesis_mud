Day 1:

At last we have arrived at Del Rimmon. It seems like only yesterday that the
order was given to prepare the troops for our eventual encampment, and yet the
100 days since that time have been exhausting. Never have I been more glad to
recieve orders to march, and I am quite pleased by what we have found here. I
have always had high confidence in Formandil, and that has been newly enforced
by the excellence of this area for our purposes. This valley is tight, compact,
and will be exceedingly easy to defend in the case that we are ever set upon
by the forces of Darkness. As commander of the troops stationed here, my job
will be twofold - to train our forces in advanced tactical strategy in order
to form elite squadrons of legionaries, and to fortify this area and construct
the necessary training grounds. We will have plenty to do in the next months,
and the men are all quite eager to get started. No less so than I.
