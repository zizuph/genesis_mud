Day 230:

Islin is still missing. No reports have come from the City indicating that he
might have returned there. After long consultation with Formandil, I have
taken the liberty of imposing harsh rules regarding sounding the Signal without
orders. Islin, though reserved in the weeks before his disappearance, was yet
a favorite of the elves here, and I do not wish to see any soldiers attempting
to copy his bizarre behavior. Training has, for the most part, returned to
normal.
