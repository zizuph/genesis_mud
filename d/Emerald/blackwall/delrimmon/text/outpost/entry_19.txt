Day 378:

Another disturbance has been discovered, and the same troop has been sent
out to meet and destroy them. This time, the ogres are joined by orcs,
and a few Darklings have been spotted as well. Maeltar is quite concerned
about this, and speaks often about the great danger posed by Darkling
influence on the evil creatures of Emerald. He seems to fear that they
are gathering under greater and greater organization, and that if this
trend continues, that they will indeed be a force to be reckoned with.
