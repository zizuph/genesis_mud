Day 337:

Our training has been fully refined, and the soldiers at Del Rimmon now
rotate every 40 days, with new faces filling the places of those who have
not been able to prove themselves. This is no longer a distracting morale
issue, but rather an accepted tenant of training at our outposts. Selvic
was successful, and has joined us as the eighth Torque-wearer. Maeltar has
decided we will not offer the test to any further recruits for the time
being, as he wishes to focus on the current group to refine our purpose.
