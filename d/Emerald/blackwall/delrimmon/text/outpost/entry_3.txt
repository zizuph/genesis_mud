Day 41:

We are nearly finished with our construction of the ledge which will connect
this outpost with the one along the cliffs. Formandil has returned to the City
to oversee the building of three catapults which we will place along the ledge.
Catapults! I was surprised indeed to hear of these plans. Frankly, I do not
see the reason to include war machines of that magnitude here. The outposts are
easily guarded, and I cannot imagine that we would not be able to defend them
even with our greenest cadets if we have adequate numbers. Even if we were to
abandon the valley, why would we have need of such catapults? There is nothing
here but the lake and the hills. I suppose there are reasons enough, and I
shall keep my doubts to myself. Formandil is not a whimsical elf.
