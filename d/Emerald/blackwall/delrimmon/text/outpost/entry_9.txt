Day 174:

Our troops have just returned from their first real experience in the field.
Formandil reported that his scouts had located orc activity in the hills to
the west of our positions, and took twenty of our finest soldiers with him to
destroy the creatures. They returned victorious, though tragically, two of the
lads had perished in the skirmish. We held a solemn ceremony last night to
honor the sacrifice of these two. Though Islin has not spoken of it at all
himself, the word has spread quickly through Del Rimmon of his valiant deeds
on the mission. Formandil tells me that were it not for Islin, that at least
half of the party would have been killed. Formandil, though very much upset
with the loss of the two soldiers, seemed quite moved by the skill and ability
displayed by Islin under pressure. I must say it comes as no surprise to me.
He has outclassed even myself in many an exercise on the grounds.
