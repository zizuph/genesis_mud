Day 80:

Still no sign of Formandil. Fortunately, Maeltar has never departed, and in
fact has taken it upon himself to improve upon our fortification strategies. He
has put forth a few enchantments, and had doors placed upon the outposts. The
elves are all quite happy about this, as it reminds them of home, using command
words and the like out here in the wilds. Moreover, Maeltar has fashioned some
kind of signal horn high on the cliffs. There is some magic at work with this
thing as well, but for what purpose I have no idea. His indication is that
this will be most useful for the communications across the valley, warnings and
such. I suspect this will be an important tool for us.
