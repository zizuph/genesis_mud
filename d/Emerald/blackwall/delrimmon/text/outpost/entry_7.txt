Day 100:

I am happy to report that 100 days into our coming to Del Rimmon, we have at
last begun our training purposes. The fortifications have been completed to
the satisfaction of Formandil and myself, and we have commenced with exercises
for the troops who are currently here. Formandil plans another trip back to the
city soon to bring a few more of the promising soldiers from the Protectorate
here for elite training. The catapults, now completed, stand idle. I assume
that is how they shall remain, as I simply cannot imagine using them in any
training processes. Maeltar has gone to the further trouble of creating
enchanted artillery shells. We tested one a while back, and its explosion was
enough to decimate at least ten soldiers in tight formation. Lately, he has
taken to creating strange symbols about the area. This is yet again a mystery
to me, but I am no factor of the ways of enchantment, and therefore trust to
his abilities and judgement on such affairs. Formandil certainly places him in
high esteem.
