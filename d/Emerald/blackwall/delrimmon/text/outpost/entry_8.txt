Day 140:

We are now 50 days into our training. I must say that I am immensely pleased
with the progress of the elves here. In particular, a young lad named Islin
has proved himself to be an outstanding soldier. Rarely have I seen one so
confident and yet prudent in his judgement in combat. His skill has become a
thing of inspiration for the others, and I am quite pleased to see that he is
handling himself well with the attention.
