Day 467:

Woe beyond woe! Catastrophe has befallen our forces, and all is a loss!
Yesterday five soldiers stumbled back into camp, accompanied by our
beloved captain Raeldu. All were badly wounded, and Raeldu was clearly
dying. Though I have not been able to deduce exactly what has come to
pass, it appears that the Darklings expected our advance, and had prepared
forces tenfold our numbers which had lain in wait in the nearby woods to
fall in behind our band as they closed on the enemy camp. What was felt
to be a sure victory by our elite forces soon became a clear-cut rout, and
our small army was decimated by the swollen hoards of darkness. Selvic,
Vidmin, Locrael, Randil, Islin, and alas! even Maeltar and Formandil -
all are dead! Raeldu has taken a stab wound to the belly, and seems sure
to soon breathe his last. But upon returning to the camp, he insisted on
being led to the forest on the west side of the lake. He ordered us all
to remain behind, and himself staggered alone into the woods. He never
returned and we have not been able to locate his body. What a black day
this is!
