Day 200:

New trainees from the City continue to arrive, and our ranks have swelled to
near capacity. I have informed Formandil that we cannot continue to take on
new soldiers without building more barracks and storage facilities for our
armaments. Formandil believes that the time has come to begin sending those
who do not seem as promising as the others back to the city. This will be hard
on the elves, as the camaraderie these exercises have generated has brought all
the soldiers very close together. I suspect the thought of sending anyone home
would come as a blow. On a somewhat strange note, Islin has seemed to withdraw
from the others lately. He has taken to wandering the hills and cliffs alone,
and seems always to be deep in thought. I have mentioned this change to
Formandil, who assures me that there is nothing to worry about.
