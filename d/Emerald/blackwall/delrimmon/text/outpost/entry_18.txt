Day 342:

Formandil has taken Islin, Randil, and Locrael, along with a cohort of
twenty soldiers to dispatch a troop of Ogres which was spotted yesterday
in the forests west of Telberin lake. The rest of us will maintain watch
and training here at Del Rimmon until their return, which we expect will
be in three weeks time.
