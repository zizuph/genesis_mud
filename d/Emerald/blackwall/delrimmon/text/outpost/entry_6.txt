Day 88:

Two of the catapults are now in operation. Formandil himself arrived with the
vanguard for the third shipment and we are at work with the final assembly.
Formandil was pleased to see the work of Maeltar with the doorways, and they
have both set to work with various emblems which are being carved in various
surfaces around the fortifications. This will be another morale boost,
as we have very few reminders of home here, and the Star of Telberin is a
welcome vision indeed. Maeltar has instructed us in the use of the Signal, and
I here put down the signal patterns he has crafted. The signals are comprised
of long and short notes similar to those we use on the walls back in the City.


    Call to Arms:    *XXXXXX* *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX* *XXXXXX* *XXXXXX* *XXXXXX*

    Call to Counsel: *XXXXXX* *XXXXXX* *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX* *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX*

    March:           *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX* *XXXXXX* *XXXXXX* *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX*

We tested the horn out for the first time tonight for a meeting. It worked
quite well, and was easily heard throughout the valley, both inside and out.
Now I must simply make sure that the troops can memorize these signal patterns
correctly.
