Day 239:

Raeldu has voluntarily relinquished his duties as chief training officer of
the Del Rimmon Outpost, though, I very much hope, only temporarily. It became
clear to Formandil and Maeltar that it will be necessary for him to complete
the same test I was given in order for him to fulfill his purpose here. The
elves have been quite willing to abide my sudden leadership of the exercises,
and I trust that Raeldu's high standards for excellence will be maintained. I
believe that this will be so, for he trained me well.
