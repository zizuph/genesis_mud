Day 235:

Islin has returned, and yet the mystery has only grown more compelling. Two
days ago, he walked into camp and asked to speak with Maeltar. All were very
glad to see him alive, and yet to our astonishment, he looked quite different
than before his disappearance. The most obvious change is that he is now
wearing a jeweled torque upon his brow in the same fashion of Maeltar and
Formandil. Only those two have I seen wear such things before, and I cannot
explain what strange events have brought one to him, and stranger yet, compel
him to wear the thing. Upon seeing him, Formandil was immensely pleased, and
it seems that Islin has been given a promotion of sorts. Maeltar has decided
that for Islin, training will no longer be necessary, and that he and Formandil
will now be granting him direct mentorship. These events are too bizarre for
me to attempt to grasp, and so I have taken it as my sole responsibility to
hold the rest of the camp in check, and buckle down on training exercises. The
sooner the elves can forget about these distractions, the better for us all.
