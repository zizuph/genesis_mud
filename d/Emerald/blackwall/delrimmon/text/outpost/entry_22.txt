Day 474:

The troops are in disarray, and my best efforts have only been able to
stay off complete insubordination and desertion. Most of the elves
wished immediately to ride to the scene of the battle to avenge our loss.
I have prevented this, knowing full well that it cannot be long before
these Darkling forces will make their attack on Telberin itself. I have
assembled the elves, and we will march home within five days. With this
devastating turn of events, I can not imagine that we will be returning
to Del Rimmon in the near future. Maeltar and Formandil were very secretive
about the true purposes of this installation, though it is clear that
a few were inducted into their trust. Alas, it seems that none now
remain of that noble band, for Raeldu has still not surfaced. It may be
that he fell into the waters of the lake and was carried over the falls.
Whatever has happened, he no longer is within the valley, of that I am
sure. My heart grieves for the fate of the Del Rimmon outposts. This has
been the most excellent training facility in the history of the elves, and
I feel sure that it will be lost, and perhaps forgotten. War beckons,
however, and I will heed the call of need. Farewell fair Valley, to the
City we must return!
