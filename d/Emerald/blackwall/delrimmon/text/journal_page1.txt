How it pains me to leave Satherel behind. However, his refusal to listen to
my interest in these matters leaves me no choice. I am confident that what
I find at the Del Rimmon outposts will provide me with enough credibility and
acclaim to make up for the fact that my Apprenticeship with the Mage guild
was incomplete. I am keeping records here of my findings so that I can easily
access information, should I need specifics, rather than worrying about
accurate memorization.

From the Archives in the Keeper's Libraries, a footsoldier who was stationed
at Del Rimmon during the time of Formandil and Maeltar's commission wrote
the following, which was preserved in diaries after his death at the Massacre
of the Western Plains.

    "The torques are now worn by four. There are others besides myself
     who were none too pleased to see Locrael and Vidmin receive them,
     for now they are highly favoured by our Captain, who has seen fit
     to remove them from training entirely! I am here for training, not
     mysteries, and I grow weary of this nonsense."

Again, from diaries written by another soldier:

    "It was amusing watching a few of our elves as they learned the
     way of using the Corporeal Flux enchantments to gain entry to
     the outposts. A few waited too long following the command word,
     and ended up battering their noses on the stone portals.
     How the company laughed!"
