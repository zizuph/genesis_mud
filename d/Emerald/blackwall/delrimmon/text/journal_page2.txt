In all my findings, the single passage I cling to with the most anticipation
came from the diary of a cook who served for a time under Raeldu, the
Captain of the infantry at Del Rimmon:

    "Tonight, I overheard things I cannot pretend to understand. Raeldu and
     Islin were enjoying more than their fair share of wine, and joking with
     each other on the ledge. Gathering herbs among the rocks as I was,
     I was in a position to overhear what I am quite sure was not meant
     to be heard by one such as myself. Raeldu spoke to Islin about how
     difficult the task of finding what he referred to as the 'Crystal
     Tower' had been. Specifically, he mentioned how even after discovering
     the place where entry to the tower lay, he could not get the Corporeal
     Flux enchantment working. Islin commented that it was good that they
     had both apprenticed in the Mage Guild before entering the armed
     forces. What in the world can they be talking about? They are both
     now wearing these odd headpieces, just as Maeltar and Formandil have
     since the beginning. I'm going to keep this to myself. I shouldn't
     have been listening in the first place."

I suspect that these two were talking about altering the command word
as the Book of Enchantments suggests. I, too, have studied as an apprentice!
