In light of the terrorist attacks which have devastated the main cities of
Emerald, His Majesty has wisely decided to reorganize the ranks of the
Keepers of Telberin so that it can be better prepared to oppose this new
menace.  While it pains His Majesty to do so, he has declared it necessary
to discharge all reserve members of the Protectorate and Order.  His Majesty
extends his deepest sympathy and apologies for this unfortunate shift, and
he also expresses his sincerest thanks and admiration for your contribution
and sacrifice for the kingdom.  Each of you will continue to be welcomed and
honoured throughout the land as a distinguished veteran of the KoT and a
faithful servant of the King and Telan-Ri.  Your devotion will be remembered
always.

In service of His Majesty,
Sir Vilgurn, Royal Overseer of the Keepers of Telberin
