Greetings fellow Grunts...
You will be pleased to know that it is possible for new members to be recruited,
even while Emerald is closed. Try the new 'recruit' command if you find anyone
suitable who want to join.

Also, the guild is being worked on, with a few new things added.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to use the 'gridea' command.
