|                    The Glorious Army of Darkness                        |
|                                                                         |
|  Simple creature, you gaze now upon the Dark Flame of Val-Shoreil, God  |
|  of all things powerful and good!  We, the Darklings,  have kept vigil  |
|  over  this  last vestige  of His  power in the world.  Harken  to its  |
|  unlight!                                                               |
|                                                                         |
|  You, it is,  who must  host the power  of the God of Darkness  within  |
|  your very  flesh!  By touching the flame  you will become  one of the  |
|  Ogre-kind  - a race of beings  mightier  than all who walk the lands,  |
|  skilled above all others in the arts of death and mayhem!              |
|                                                                         |
|  But know this.  The Ogre, mighty in body, is also feeble in mind.  If  |
|  you choose  to embody  the power of one  of these creatures  you will  |
|  lose not only your mental abilities, but some of your skills as well.  |
|  Yet what are such small concerns when compared to the glory of death-  |
|  dealing in the Army of Darkness?  Touch the flame,  and the making of  |
|  of a thousand elvish nightmares will be yours!                         |
|                                                                         |
|  But beware! If you are already an Ogre, touch not the flame! Doing so  |
|  will strip you of your glory  and return you to your pathetic former-  |
|  self, removing you from the Army of Darkness!                          |
