Greetings Ogre. I am XyzzyX, a Darkling of the Second Circle of Power. Your animal mind is far too stupid to comprehend that yet, and so I shall not bother explaining. For now, you must trust me, and do as you are told. I have transfered you to the Barracks for the Army of Darkness. Make it your home by giving the wall a good <kick>. Once you have done this, your first task is to find the Repository of Skulls. It is just north of the guildhall, near the tower. Once you have gotten your bearings, you must locate the Repository, and I will give you your first orders as a member of the Army of Darkness. Go now. Little else will make sense until you find the Repository of Skulls.
