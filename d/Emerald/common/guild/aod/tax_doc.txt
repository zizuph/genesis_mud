 * Guru skill levels require a skull-collecting quest. Only once the
   player has collected 6,000 skulls may they begin guru-level training
   for club. For 2-handed combat, they must collect 10,000 skulls before
   beginning guru-level training. Thus, the "difficult quest" is
   present for training skills > 90.

========================
OGRE STAT MODIFICATIONS:
========================

All stats are flatlined to human levels, and then special ogre
modifications are applied. Those that benefit the ogre are listed
below with combat aid/tax calculations applied:

Strength: 100 increases to 150 (150% boost). This has a minimal increase
          on combat, affecting only the encumberance of the player.
          In his calculations for the Gladiator guild, Glindor suggested
          a 0.25% combat benefit for berzerk, which raises strength from
          100 to 110. Based on this calculation, we would assume that
          here, a 0.34% combat aid is appropriate.

          Combat aid: 0.34%
          Tax       : 0.06%

Carnak: New strength caid cost is 34
Strength Boost = 34 caid (100 caid + Weapon Boost * 0.2)
          Combat aid: 34.0%
          Tax       : 5.66%
          
Con:      100 increases to 130. Hitpoints increase from 1900 to 2500
          (32% increase). Thus, a player taking 100 hitpoints of damage
          loses 1/25 (4%) rather than 1/19 (5.3%) of their hitpoints.
          According to Cotillion, the fight becomes 32% longer, which
          we translate into combat aid.

          Combat aid : 32%
          Tax        : 5.33%

          Total aid  : 66%
          Total tax  : 11%

COMBAT SPECIALS:
================

CRUSH (Uses skill SS_AOD_WALLOP)

    Here, Ogres seek to crush their enemies either with their giant fists
    or with any weapons they might be weilding. Damage does not take
    weapons into account, but does bludgeoning damage. There is no reset
    time on the attack, rather the prep time is the entire delay. The
    attack is cancelled if the player moves during the prep time (to 
    prevent bouncing) unless fighting another player.

    Note: The original version of this attack capped the amount of strength
          taken into consideration to 150, resulting in an unsatisfactory
          experience for the players. With Cotillion's help, I've retooled
          the formula to truly allow players' strength to play a major
          factor, calculating all the way up to str = 300! So far, I don't
          think there are any Ogres with strength that high, but I'm sure
          there will be. The philosophy here is that ogres are terrifyingly
          strong, but none too accurate. ;-)

    Pen Calculation:
	29 caid (58 caid divided by 2 due to not
                        scaling with stats)

          Combat aid : 29%
          Tax        : 4.83%

    Rampage Bonus: 0.26%

    Final tax for Crush: 5.09%


OGRESTOMP (not supported by a trainable skill)

    Ogres have the ability to disable room exits for 15 seconds by
    stomping the ground and creating an earthquake. They prevent
    people from walking on the shaking ground. This traps people in
    the room for the time the effect lasts, but does not affect
    combat itself.

    There is a 5 minute cooldown period between stomps for any single
    Ogre. Multiple ogres can stack the effect, but with diminishing
    results. Adding another stomp while the quake is in effect
    extends the quake by half the value of the last stomp. So:

        Stomp #1 - 15.00 sec.
        Stomp #2 -  7.50 sec. extension
        Stomp #3 -  3.75 sec. extension. (etc ...)

    When a player stomps, a prop is set to the room, which lasts for
    2 minutes. After a quake stops, any new stomps to the room
    while the prop is still set to the room only create an effect
    lasting 5 seconds. In this way, we prevent players from
    creating a room lock. Mathmatically, it is possible to achieve
    a total room lock only with a team of 60 ogres.

    For a more complete explanation, see:

        /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/balance_doc.txt

    Tax for ogrestomp: 2% (arbitrarily set, since no real combat aid)

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
====================

THE FORGE

The Army of Darkness has a Forge which provides guild members with the
ability to purchase high quality Armours and Weapons. At the top level,
these weapons and armours can have hit/pen and AC values in the 58-60
range, which is extreme. Therefore, extreme cost is applied. In addition
to money, players who wish to purchase such weapons must find and bring
back to the guild *magical* weapons or armours they find in the realms.
Costs for the top items are:

    Top Weapon Cost: 200 platinum coins, 50 returned magical items.
    Top Armour Cost: 200 platinum coins, 75 returned magical items.

Ogres train only one weapon skill - Club. Ogres are unable to wield
one-handed weapons. This means that in Genesis, ogres are limited to
wielding two-handed clubs - quite a severe drawback. Worse, ogres are
unable to wear armours that are not made in their own forge. This is
perhaps the worst drawback of all - they will never be able to wear
a single piece of armour they find in the realms.

Even with these drawbacks, we should tax this feature heavily, in
anticipation of hardcore players who find the means to purchase such
weapons despite the high cost. Lets use the precedent of the saving rack
as a similarly powerful feature.

Tax for the forge: 5%

DOUBLE-TWO-HANDED WIELDING

Ogres are big enough to wield a two-handed weapon in a single hand.
This means that they will be able to wield two 60/60 clubs. This ability
exists in conjunction with the fact that they are unable to wield one-
handed weapons. There are numerous excellent one-handed weapons in
the game, many of them with hit/pen ratios above 50. Other guilds train
two-handed combat to high levels, and enjoy the benefits of being able
to wield one-handed weapons, which are the most common and abundant
weapons in the game.

Tax for double-two-handed wielding: 2%

OGRE SKIN

Ogres are unable to wear the armours that are in the game. Only by
spending time scavenging and bringing in items to melt down in the forge
and then spending money and credits to purchase items can ogres gain
armour class boosts. Worse, Ogres are completely unable to wear
shields of any kind. Additionally, shields are not offered in the forge.
To compensate, Ogres are naturally tough. They are given an AC boost in
all hit locations with the following formulae:

    AC_FACTOR = 30
    skin = (who->query_stat(SS_CON) / 10) + AC_FACTOR;
    who->set_all_hitloc_unarmed(MIN(skin, AOD_AC_CAP));

This results in a natural armour class range for Ogres from 30-40,
rising as their con increases. 

Tax for Ogre skin: 2%

TOTAL TAX FOR ADDITIONAL FEATURES: 9%
