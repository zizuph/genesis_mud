Unique Approach:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guild bases most things on skull collecting. When players kill one
of the five main races (excluding goblins) of Genesis, they may collect
the skull. It must be they that got the killing blow to allow this.

Heads that are collected allow the player to ingest the brain fluid
from the skull, increasing their intelligence. 

Numerous factors are affected:

    - Upon joining, intelligence is set to 1 (yes, one!)
      This is devastating to a player. 10 mana is not enough to cast
      even the most basic magic (the zodiac gem, for instance).
      A player's intelligence increases 1 point for each 1000 skulls
      they collect. This is an incredibly slow process. Intelligence
      for an Ogre is then capped at 10 regardless of skulls collected.

        * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/aod_shadow.c
              init_guild_member()

    - Besides unarmed combat and defense (the natural animalistic
      abilities of an ogre), training is not possible until a player
      has collected sufficient skulls. At each of the 6 training rooms,
      the max training level slowly increases as more skulls are
      collected by the player. The top levels of skill are only
      available once a player has collected huge amounts of skulls.
      Guru levels require 10,000 skulls to have been collected, and
      to achieve superior guru, a player must have 100,000 skulls!

        * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/lib/training_module.c

    - Guild leaders are not assigned until someone has been able
      to collect 10,000 skulls. At this point, the top guild positions
      are awarded to the players who have the most skulls collected
      (top position) and the person who has the highest number of 
      skulls collected per hour (second in command.) New leaders are
      chosen by the code every 10 days from thereafter, building a
      collecting competition into the guild. Leader benefits include
      cheaper prices at the forge, a free meal once a day at the
      mess hall, a morale bonus for rolls on team member specials,
      and private chambers.

    - The guild itself is only half complete at opening. Each type
      of skull that is collected benefits the guild with a new addition
      once 25,000 skulls of that type have been collected by the
      combined efforts of all guild members, as follows:

          25K elf skulls   : magic weapons are sold at the forge
          25K dwarf skulls : magic armours are sold at the forge
          25K human skulls : the guild gets a shop
          25K gnome skulls : the guild gets a bank
          25K hobbit skulls: the guild gets an eatery (mess hall)

      * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/obj/master.c
          - Note, this is the master file for the guild, controlling
            much functionality. It is a database of sorts, keeping
            track of the number of skulls each player has collected.
            Though complex, it is hopefully well-documented enough
            to make sense to experienced folks. If not, please ask!


Other Ogre Modifications:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ogres are unable to sneak or hide. Big, clumsy, and stupid are they.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/cmdsoul.c
        aod_sneak()
        aod_hide()

Ogres are unable to whisper without being overheard.

Ogres are unable to wield one-handed weapons. This is a huge
problem, as most of the best weapons in the game have been created for
the many many one-handed specialists in the game. 

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/aod_shadow.c
        wield()

Ogres are unable to wear shields. This is also a drastic disadvantage
because shields have become so powerful in factoring in the amount of
damage received through combat.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/aod_shadow.c
        wear_arm()

Ogres are unable to wear normal armour. Every piece of armour in the
game is too small for ogres to wear. This is a huge disadvantage,
obviously. Too huge, in fact. So, the ogres have a smith in their guild
who can melt down scavenged items to create ogre-sized armour of varying
qualities. This will be described in a separate section below.

  * Same as above

Ogres are able to wield two-handed weapons in a single hand. This is
a very great advantage, hopefully well balanced by the above factors.
The game has never given much favor to two-handed weapons. Though there
are a number of very high-quality ones in the game, they are few and
far between when compared to the massive proliferation of one-handers.
Given that Ogres are only skilled in club, this means that ogres are
(essentially) limited to wielding two-handed clubs as one-handed clubs.
The above mentioned forge also is able to make these.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/aod_shadow.c
        enter_inv()
        leave_inv()

Ogres have naturally thick hide which (to compensate for their lack of
ability to wear normal armour) is also based on their con, and gets
capped at 40.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/aod_shadow.c
        init_guild_member()


Combat Specials:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crush - Similar in premise to the Gladiator "charge", this does not take
~~~~~   weapons into account, but rather bases its damage on the idea
        that an ogre is slamming either huge fists or weapons down
        on their opponent. Stength, rather than dex, is the main
        factor in determining success. Damage potential is meant to
        have a high minimum and a relatively mid-range maximum.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/special_attacks.c
  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/cmdsoul.c
        aod_crush()
  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/race_shadow.c
        leave_env() (prevention of bouncing tactics)

Ogrestomp - This idea is similar to the Tauren Warstomp from World of
~~~~~~~~~   Warcraft. The Ogre can smash the ground with his foot,
            creating a room effect (earthquake) that prevents players
            from using room exits for a brief period of time.

   Comments:
  
     The idea here is to allow the Ogres this nice special to help
     prevent their prey from running away all the time. However, this
     could be disastrous if it were allowed to be abused. So ... the
     implementation includes diminishing returns for repeated use
     as follows:
  
         - A player can only perform an <ogrestomp> once every five
           minutes. A prop is added to the player that guarantees
           this.
         - When an <ogrestomp> is performed, a prop is also added to the
           room in which it was performed that lasts for 2 minutes.
         - When an <ogrestomp> is performed for the  FIRST* time in a
           room, it inserts the effect object into that room. The
           object is set to last for 15 seconds.
         - If,  WHILE THE OBJECT IS YET PRESENT IN THE ROOM* another
           <ogrestomp> is performed, the duration of the effect object
           is extended by half of the current duration. In this way,
           the absolute maximum duration for any effect is 30 seconds,
           regardless of how many Ogres you have in the room stomping.
         - Each additional <ogrestomp> increases the value of the room
           prop by one.
         - So, after the final <ogrestomp> is performed, there are always
           two minutes before the prop is removed from the room.
         - While the prop persists in the room, any new ogrestomp
           effects added to the room are set to only 5 seconds.
         - Once the room prop is removed from the room, new ogrestomps
           will again last for 15 seconds in duration.
  
     Lets imagine a scenareo to paint this more clearly. Lets imagine
     That a team of 5 Ogres, A, B, C, D, and E, each decide to use
     their <ogrestomp> ten seconds apart to trap their prey in the
     room.
  
       00:00 - Ogre A stomps, creating effect that lasts 15 seconds.
       00:10 - Ogre B stomps, extending the effect to 22.5 seconds.
       00:20 - Ogre C stomps, extending the effect to 26.25 seconds.
       00:27 - stomp effect disappears.
       00:30 - Ogre D stomps, creating effect that lasts 5 seconds.
       00:35 - stomp effect disappears.
       00:40 - Ogre E stomps, creating effect that lasts 5 seconds.
       00:45 - stomp effect disappears.
       
     At this point, no new stomps would be able to be done for another
     4 minutes and 15 seconds.

     But, as always, in balance, we must assume the optimal scenareo.
     The question must be asked, is it possible to permenantly fix
     a room so that a player will not be able to flee? The answer,
     of course, is yes ... but let us look at what it would take:

       00:00 - Ogre A stomps, creating effect that lasts 15 seconds.
       00:10 - Ogre B stomps, extending the effect to 22.5 seconds.
       00:23 - Ogre C stomps, creating effect that lasts 5 seconds.

       At this point, there are still 277 seconds before
       Ogre A can repeat the stomp, and any additional stomps will
       only extend the effect by 5 seconds. So ... we would need
       56 more ogres to achieve this effect. Thus, we must conclude,
       that unless there is a team of 60 Ogres (at the writing of
       this document, it is rare to see more than 50 players,
       including wizards, logged in at any given time) there will
       never be anything even remotely close to a total area block.
       A more realistically large team of 5 Ogres, as displayed
       above, can, at optimal performance, only hope to achieve
       15 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 37 seconds of effect, followed by
       4 minutes and 23 seconeds before the effect can again
       be activated. In essence, this effect is a minor combat
       advantage, even with fairly large teams of Ogres.

The Forge:
~~~~~~~~~

In discussion of the forge, we must keep in mind:

    1. Ogres are unable to wear armour. (It does not fit them.)
    2. Ogres are unable to wield one-handed weapons. (their hands are too
       big)
    3. Ogres only train weapon skill for clubs and unarmed combat.
    4. Ogres may not use shields. (it is pointless in their culture)

The ramifications of the above are fairly stifling for a fighter guild.
Being able to wear effective armour, and find useful weapons is of utmost
importance to any fighter guild. These stipulations mean that no armours
that a guild member finds in shops or on npcs around Genesis can be used.
Also, it means that the only weapons in the game that they can find to
wield are two-handed clubs, which at present in the game are relatively
poorly represented.

With this in mind, the guild has its own forge and blacksmith. Using the
forge, guild members may take armours or weapons they find in the game and
turn them in to the forge to be melted down. In doing this, they earn
"credit" at the forge. Turn-ins result in credits by the following rule:

    1. Armours or one-handed weapons melted down earn 1 credit.
    2. Two-handed weapons melted down earn 2 credits.
    3. Non-magical items melted down yield "normal" credits.
    4. Magical items melted down yield "magical" credits.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/rooms/forge.c

Once players have earned credit by turning in weapons and armours to be
melted down at the forge, they may then order weapons and armours that the
blacksmith knows how to make. In addition to spending their earned credits,
the guild members must also spend money - for the highest level armours and
weapons, as many as 200 platinum coins for a single purchase. Here follow
the lists of available weapons and armours, with their credit and coin
cost included. I will follow each list with a list of the hit/pen ratio
as well as the ac for armours.

All of the above armours can be worn exclusively be Ogres.

  * /d/Emerald/common/guild/aod/arm/forgearm*.c

Some considerations:

 - Because 60/60 weapons and ac 60 armours are extremely powerful, it is
   necessary to make them very difficult to obtain. Players in other guilds
   have the opportunity to earn weapons of such quality by fighting the
   various creatures in the realm who wield/wear them. That opportunity is
   not afforded to Ogres, who are too big to fit in such weapons/armours.
   Therefore, we give them the opportunity here, but it comes at a steep
   cost.

   I am treating the fact that players must earn credits by turning in
   magical weapons and armour that they find as a type of "quest" which
   must be completed to obtain these items. The man page on weapons and
   armour stipulates that weapons and armours with numbers above 40 may not
   be sold in shops without some sort of quest. Moreover, the elite forge
   items cost huge platinum fees. For instance, to obtain two 60/60 weapons
   and a full set of top armour would require 700 platinum coins, and 110
   forge credits. Platinum coins are not terribly hard to come by for the
   Genesis elite. However, even the best players will be hard pressed to earn
   110 magical credits very quickly. If I discover that they are, I will take
   steps to increase these requirements.

 - The theme of the guild stipulates that Ogres are *terribly* low in
   intelligence and wisdom. The idea behind the guild is that the Ogres
   are trying to raise their intelligence to increase their capacity to
   master more complex skills and arts. The way that they can raise their
   intelligence is by drinking the mind fluid that is rendered from the
   skulls of their decapitated victims when they turn them in to the guild
   headquarters. The items listed above are not all available when the guild
   first opens - the idea being that the blacksmith is too stupid at first to
   make anything better than hunks of scrap iron. It turns out that elves are
   the masters of metalurgical arts (in our theme.) Therefore, as elf skulls
   are collected by the guild, the blacksmith learns how to forge new items.
   Not until the guild has collected 25,000 elf skulls can the will the
   blacksmith be able to forge the "magical" armours and weapons.

 - I have no idea what impact the above guild feature should have on the
   tax. Only guild members may earn forge credits and buy items. However,
   it is important to remember that they can only wear armour that is made
   by this forge. Also, there is (currently) low support for two-handed
   club weapons in the game. Also worth considering is the fact that
   non-guild members are able to use all the weapons sold here, though
   wielding them two-handed since they are not Ogres. One type of thinking
   suggests that the limitations of the guild balance out against the
   benefits of the forge, cancelling out a tax increase. I'm perfectly
   willing, however, to add some tax based on this, if it is deemed
   appropriate

Final Thought:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A big thanks to all who helped make this guild a possibility, and to those
who now put their time into reviewing it! It has and will continue to be
my pleasure to work with such fine people.
