Honor? Yes! These are best treats. Treats for Officer only. You not most famous, YOU NOT DESERVE HONOR! Listen to Honor ... they best! Ogg want! General and Corporal both get. Now you listen. If Officer, you only pay HALF PRICE at Forge!! Ogg think that silly, but maybe only because Ogg jealous of Officer. When Army have Mess Hall, Officer get dozen free drink and free meal once every day. But that not all! Officer also get special sleeping hole! So special, no one else can go there! Only Officer! Bosses not tell Ogg where special sleeping hole is. They say Officer have to find, but it somewhere in guild. Officer also able to sit on special hill in Volcano and yell at other Ogre. Because Headhunter General so famous, other Ogre smash faces better when on team. It true! He give you buttkicking! Ask Ogg! Last thing. General also only Officer who can remove head from trophy spike. ANY TROPHY SPIKE! You not cry if General take favorite head off spike. YOU NOT AS FAMOUS AS GENERAL!
