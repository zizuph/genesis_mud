Ogg teach about forge, but it tricky topic. YOU LISTEN GOOD! Wussy elf suit too small for Ogre - it true. Ogre HATE sissy elf suit! But suit good when elf try to bonk Ogre. Sometimes suit even tougher than Ogre skin. IT TRUE SO SHUT UP AND LISTEN! Ogre so big no suit can fit. So ... Bosses give special job to Ogre Smith. Smith drink much mind juice, learn to make suit - suit that fit Ogre!! But Smith need much juice for better learn. More skulls make Smith even better. Smith also make smashing sticks. Now ... this hurt Ogg brain to talk about, so listen and learn FIRST TIME! Ogg not like to say big number two times. Bosses tell Ogg that when ... twenty ... five ... thousand ... dwarf skulls brought in from Harvest, then Smith know how to make MAGIC OGRE SUIT! Ogg want magic suit, so you go smash dwarf faces! Even better, if same big number of elf skulls harvested, then Smith know how to make MAGIC SMASHING STICK! Ogg want bad. You go smash and smash so Smith know how to make best stuff! Wait ... Ogg still need teach you about scrap. It only way Smith can make. You ask Ogg about scrap next.
