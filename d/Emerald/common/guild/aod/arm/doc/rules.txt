So you shut up now. You sit down. You listen to Ogg. Ogg need talk about tradition and Ogre rule. Rule for Ogre not easy to know if you not born Ogre. Ogg born Ogre long time ago. You Ogre by Boss magic. So you shut up. OGRE LISTEN AND LEARN RULE! Ogre learn rule when baby - if not learn, Mommy-Ogre smash big time! You not have Mommy-Ogre. It sad. So listen or OGG SMASH BIG TIME! So ... big rule. You be nice to goblin. All Ogre love goblin. Goblin so cute! Ho ho ho ... it make Ogg happy to think about goblin. If Ogg see anyone try to smash goblin OGG SMASH ANYONE!! Not smash goblin. Other rule? Hmmm ... not really rule, but Ogre not like sissy stick. You know sissy stick because it not bash, it cut. CUTTING? NOT LIKE!! But sometimes Ogre might need to cut. Ogre know trick to make cutting piece. You ask Ogg about cutting, maybe. Other other rule? Hmmm ... no more. Ogre do anything Ogre want. But most want is to SMASH SMASH SMASH!! Go smash, but follow rule. You learn. Ogg like Mommy-Ogre to you now. HAHAHA!!!
