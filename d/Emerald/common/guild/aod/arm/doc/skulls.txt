Skulls? Ho ho ho!! This good topic. Ogg like Elf skulls best. Ogre can crunch them and crunch them! Sometimes Ogg eat elf skulls. But not do. It make Bosses angry. If eat skull, Bosses zap with purple magic! It hurt, but Ogg always so excited to see magic. Ogg clap and clap. This make Bosses even angrier. Purple magic get bigger. Ogg stop clapping then. But Ogg off track. SKULLS!! You go get them! Smash face of puny race! You smash face of elf! If can't find elf, other race okay too. You smash hobbit. Smash dwarf. Smash human. Smash gnome too! But gnome hard to find. Ogg never smash gnome. These best races to smash! Ogg sometimes able to harvest from other races too, but Bosses say it not worth Ogg time. Oh, almost forget ... not smash goblin. Oh no! Goblin so cute and fun! Hee hee hee! Ogg love goblin. Goblin fun to hold and pat on head. But not pat too hard! Goblin fragile like elf. Crush elf! Pat goblin. You go find other race, like elf. You smash face. Then, you <rip head from corpse> and <collect skull> in sack. Sack can hold so many heads! You bring back when you tired of smashing and <deposit> in Repository. Then drink mind juice and go train for even better smashing! Sometime Ogg find skull not want to <collect>. Sometimes skull make nice trophy. But this other lesson. Go now ... you get skull and drink juice!
