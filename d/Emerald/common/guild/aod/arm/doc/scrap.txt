Good, Ogg teach about scrap. Scrap important for forge. You learn! Now, when you smash elf, elf usually drop sissy suit pieces and smashing or poking stick. These too tiny for Ogre to use, so Ogre maybe just leave on ground. NO! YOU NOT LEAVE ON GROUND! Maybe Ogre take and sell to shop. Maybe ... maybe ... but then Ogre is stupid like stump! No. Ogre take sissy suit pieces and elf sticks to Forge. Then, at forge, Ogre <scrap> them! At Forge, you <scrap> everything you find! Not leave on ground or sell. Okay, maybe sell sometimes for coin. But you <scrap> lots! This give you credit at forge. Smith not have metal! So only way Smith can make Ogre stick or smashing stick is if you bring metal to Smith! You scrap what you find, and then Smith have metal for making. You want buy from Smith? Ok! You need credit from scrap and coin. Ogre suit and stick cost more coin than in shop - BUT YOU SHUT UP AND NOT COMPLAIN! Better than no stick or suit. Oh, almost forgot ... when extra big number of elf or dwarf skulls collected, then magic scrap give magic credits. Only magic credits can make magic suit or stick!
