You ask Ogg to teach about Ogre? That good. You learn. You Ogre now so Ogg job to help. SHUT UP AND LISTEN!  First thing you learn is that now you biggest of all! Elves not biggest ... no. Elves teeny and sad. Maybe reach belly button if REALLY tall elf. But not talk about elf now. OGG HATE TALK ABOUT ELF! So now you big. So big and strong. You stronger than before - like dragon! Ogg wrestle dragon once - Ogg win! It only baby dragon but you SHUT UP! You carry more than EVER. You also tough. You not so wussy as before. Now people bonk and bonk and you not fall down. HAHA! You big and tough. Maybe not so fast anymore, but that not matter! You slower than before, but so strong!! Even talking strong for Ogre! You talk and people run away because voice so big. But sometimes people not listen when Ogre talk. Maybe you find quest man who not listen? You <npcreport> that man, and Darklings will know. Maybe make things better when Darklings know. What else about Ogre ... hmmm ... oh, you also dumb now. Dumb like stump. STUMP SMARTER THAN YOU. So you shut up and not try trick or magic. Magic extra fun, but too tricky. Ogg only Ogre who can trick with magic. Ogg special! Special for Army. You ask Ogg about Army. You learn! Maybe also ask Ogg about rules. OGRE HAVE RULES!
