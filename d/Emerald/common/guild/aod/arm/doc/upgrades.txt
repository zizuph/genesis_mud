You ask Ogg about upgrade? You shut up now. This tricky topic so YOU LISTEN. Puny races tricky. Each know something special that Ogre not know! Bosses teach Ogg so Ogg know about it. Ogg tell you what puny races know. Elf know about smashing and poking sticks. Maybe they called weapon. Elf know how to make weapon EXTRA TRICKY to smash face so much harder. That what elf know. Dwarf? Dwarf know same thing, but with armour. Dwarf make best armour, and extra good. Gnome? Gnome know about counting coin and keeping safe. They know bank. Human? Human know about trade. They good at buy and sell all sort of thing. Hobbit? Ogg not think Hobbit know anything. But maybe Hobbit know how to cook. So ... Bosses want Ogre to learn what puny races know. When you <deposit> skull in Repository, Bosses take half of mind fluid and keep safe, give only half to you. Other half they keep to give to Ogre specialist for each race. Bosses say when ... twenty ... five ... thousand skull collected for any race, then Ogre specialist can know what that race know. If elf, Ogre get magic weapon at forge. If dwarf, same but magic armour. If gnome, Army get bank. If human, Army get shop. If Hobbit, Army get mess hall. Go smash face and Army get upgrade!
