Ahhh ... you have managed to collect a skull! Very good, Ogre. Soon you shall reap the rewards of the Harvest. Return now to the Repository of Skulls. There you must <deposit> what you have collected. In so doing, you shall drink of the mind fluid, and the simple possibilities of your tiny Ogre mind will be expanded considerably. Once you have done this, Ogg will be notified. It is he who shall complete your training, as I have other important things to which I must attend. Therefore, make haste to the Repository, Ogre! Return and <deposit> what you have Harvested!
