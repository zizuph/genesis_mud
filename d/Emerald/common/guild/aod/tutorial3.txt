Excellent, Ogre ... with that Harvesting Sack you are now equipped to contribute to the Harvest. Your mind is still far too primitive to understand the Harvest itself. I will leave it for Ogg to teach you of these things. However, before your mind can be receptive to the limited powers we have given to Ogg, you must collect your first skull. Go now. Find one of the chosen races - human, dwarf, gnome, hobbit, or (preferably) elf - and <crush> the puny fool using your Ogre strength. Once the being is dead, <rip> the head of your prey from its corpse. Finally, using your sack, <collect> the head. You can <exa sack> to get more information on how to harvest skulls. Go now ... you will be unable to understand more until you have begun participation in the Harvest. Find prey, and collect your first skull mighty Ogre!
