/*
 * /w/tulix/tester_tool.c
 *
 * This toolsoul has been coded to provide commands that the standard
 * tracer tool does not. This toolsoul will be of use to wizards who
 * want to test the areas they have coded.
 *
 * This toosoul provides commands which could easily be abused.
 * Its use will therefore be restricted, at least for now.
 *
 * This toolsoul is based on the tracer tool.
 *
 * Coded 20/04/96 by Tulix III.
 * Recoded 15/12/99 by Tulix due to move from /d/Emerald/ to /w/.
