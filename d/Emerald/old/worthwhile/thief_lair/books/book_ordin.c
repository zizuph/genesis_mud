You turn to the chapter titled 'Ordinaries'.
The 'ordinaries' are the ten standard patterns that the basic shield can have
one of. The background of the shield is the 'field' and the 'ordinary' is a
design which is painted ontop of the field. 
The ten ordinaries are:-

chief   - a horizontal stripe across the top of the shield
pale    - a vertical stripe down the middle of the shield
fess    - a horizontal stripe across the middle of the shield
chevron - an 'upside-down V' shaped stripe ( i.e. /\ )
cross   - two stripes (horizontal & vertical) to form a cross shape ( i.e. + )
pall    - a Y shaped design
pile    - a triangular design which is like a 'filled in V'
bend    - a diagonal stripe from top left to bottom right ( i.e. \ )
bend sinster - a bend, except from top right to bottom left ( i.e. / )
satire  - a bend & bend sinster combined to make a diagonal cross ( i.e X )

These are the ten most common patterns that are found on the heraldic shields.
There is another class of patterns, the 'sub-ordinaries' but are not used
frequently enough to warrant any more pages here.
