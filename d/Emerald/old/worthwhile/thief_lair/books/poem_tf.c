        A teenage fantasy
        -----------------
 
        Remember the time, when you were young,
        where innocence reigns; songs merrily sung;
        across open fields, you skip and run:
        in love with each other, together as one.
 
        Above you, the birds that sit in the tree,
        beyond the brook, a rabbit you'll see:
        and as you run on, you giggle with glee,
        you both are happy; you both are free.
 
        Far up in the sky, the sun is so bright,
        blessing you both it's eternal light,
        and all around you, a lovely sight,
        dozens of flowers, pure and white.
 
        High in the trees, you hear a sound,
        a sweet, sweet melody, floating around:
        the music of nature, you have found,
        and as you listen, onwards you bound.
 
        Catching your breath, you stop at a stile,
        your sweetheart looks at you, and smiles;
        and as you've wandered several miles,
        you think you'll stay here just a while.
 
        You pick a flower from it's stalk,
        as on the stile, you laugh and talk,
        and share your feelings, and your thoughts,
        and later on, decide to walk.
 
        Homeward bound, across the land,
        walking slowly, you run your hand
        across your lover's thigh, now tanned,
        and watch the sunset, forever grand.
 
        And as the daylight fades away,
        dusk sweeps in without delay,
        and as you reach your home, you pray
        tomorrow can be like today.
