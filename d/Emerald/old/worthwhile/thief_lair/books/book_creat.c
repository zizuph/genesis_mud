You turn to the chapter titled 'Creatures'.
In the earliest days of heraldry, even before the Ordinaries were given a
structured classification, people would paint their shields with creatures.
It was common to paint such mythical creatures as dragons and unicorns, and
no creature was considered too non-sensical to furnish your shield with.
There are two sub-groups of creatures, the monsters and the beasts: there is
a thin dividing line between the two at times, but most people came to agree
the following divisions:-
Monsters: the mythical creatures of legends and fairy-tales. These include
such things as the unicorn, cockatrice, gryphon, pegasus, dragon and wyvern.
Beasts: these are the more familiar creatures. Common examples of these are
the stag, goat, bull, wolf, talbot, boar and of course, lion.
The pose which the creature adopted came to be classified, too. There are
many different possible poses, for example rampant, dormant, or passant.
Alternatively, instead of painting the whole creature, sometimes only the head
of the creature was painted on the shield.
