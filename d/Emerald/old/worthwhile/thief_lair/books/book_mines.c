You study the book of mines.
Emerald has extensive mines located mainly to the east of the land. The mines 
have been the source of a great amount of wealth for the people of this land,
and the early traders named the land 'Emerald', because of the large numbers
of the valuable gem that could be mined. Gems from Emerald have been known
throughout the whole world for the great beauty they possess, and they have
been treasured amongst those that could afford them. Greed has taken over some
of Dwarves that work the mines; often they jealously guard the mines, and are 
hostile to intruders. The mine workings are becoming old now, and some parts
are considered too dangerous to enter.
