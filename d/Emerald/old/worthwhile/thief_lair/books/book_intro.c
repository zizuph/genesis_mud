You turn to the introductory chapter. 
Heraldry is the study of coats of arms, a subject which is rich in history, 
and of interest to many people. In the early days of war and conflict, the
battles consisted of disorganised bands of villagers, armed with sticks and
spears. Soon the shield was invented, and used for protection. When full
suits of armour were invented, a problem arose: how to tell who was who.
The problem was solved by painting shields with different patterns in a few
bright colours. Often a coloured tunic was worn over the suit of armour, with
the same pattern and colours of the shield. Hence the 'coat of arms' was made.
Each family would have a unique design, and thus everyone on the battlefield
would know who their enemy was. The patterns and designs were then put into
categories, and the colours standardised. Thus, out of the creative talent of
the battle-hardened families, the art and science of heraldry was born.
