You turn to the chapter titled 'Cadence'.
When on the battlefield, you could easily tell from the coat of arms of your
enemy which family they belonged too. Further more, you could also tell the
'candence' of your opponent, which is the term given to their position in the
family. For example, if you were the fifth son, you would have a ring painted
on your shield, superimposed upon the coat of arms of your family. Thus it is
easy to distinguish between the different family members on the battlefield.
The first symbol of cadence is best described as a five-toothed comb, with the
first tooth from either end missing. 
The other symbols are:- 2nd son, a cresent; 3rd son, a star; 4th son, a bird; 
5th son, a ring; 6th son, a fleur-de-lis; 7th son, a rose; 8th son, a cross. 
These are the most common symbols of cadence. 
Thus the big family squabbles about who-killed-who were put to an end.
