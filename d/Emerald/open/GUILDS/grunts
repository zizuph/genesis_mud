                             
                             The Grunts Guild
                             ----------------

This is a race guild for goblins. It was initially kept as simple as possible, 
but inevitably extra features were added as time passed. The guild first
opened to mortals a few years ago (it was the first race guild), and but
for a brief spell when Emerald was closed down, has been open ever since.
Guild members get the following:

1) A lovely new set of emotions to annoy the other races, who have not got
   them. These emotions are the whole basis of the guild, and have been
   toned down slightly to meet with arch-wizard approval.
   Member have the ability to 'crap'. This leaves them with a pile of dung,
   which can be left in busy places so that other players slip over in it,
   or alternatively can be thrown. Not useful in combat, but fun....
   Members also get a 'warcry' of their own choosing, to scream at people
   as appropriate.

2) An auto-loading collar as a guild item. This adds the guild soul, and
   provides members the ability to do a 'who' list of guild members currently 
   logged on. It has been written as armour with ac of 0 and set A_NECK 
   which is not a current hit location for humanoids.

3) As with the other guilds, this one has a start location, which has a few
   limited services to offer. They do not confer any special advantages to
   guild members, and are usable by other races. These facilities are a shop, 
   a library, a bulletin board, a common board, an alcove for meditation, 
   a bank, a bar (exquisite menu), and at the main guild room you can list 
   your guilds. A training room is also available, for anyone to train.

4) The members get new additional titles. As goblins are generally smelly,
   I thought it would be nice to have titles related to smells. The titles
   start at 'fragraced Grunt' through 'toxic Grunt' and through a few more
   until the top title, 'Lethal Grunt'. Wizards get to keep their old
   titles naturally.
   The title that you get is based on your average dex, str & con, and is
   now also based on the number of significant living things you have killed.
   The guild shadow contains the code for titles, and also contains the
   code for recording any significant kills made by the player.
   The guild member will be seen to add another notch on his/her collar when
   a kill is made. It is possible to 'count' the notches by examining them.
   The number of kills made by the player is stored as skill number 132060.

The guild itself is located in the caves of Emerald. As the caves are dark,
there is a secret passage leading from the start location to the cave entrance,
which is lit along its route by torches that cannot be taken. (This was done
so no-one will be starting in the dark, unlike those poor Gnomes in Padermud)

All guild rooms are contained in /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/
The most significant rooms are listed below:

    Function       Path
    --------       ----
    join/leave     /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/main.c
    training       /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/train.c
    bank           /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/bank.c
    bar            /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/bar.c
    shop           /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/shop.c

All guild objects are contained in /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/obj/
The most significant objects are listed below:

    Object         Path
    ------         ----
    shadow         /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/obj/grunts_shadow.c
    soul           /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/obj/grunts_soul.c
    collar         /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/obj/grunts_collar.c
    dung(!)        /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/obj/grunts_crap.c

There is currently no entrance quest. It is quite possible that this may
change in the future.

                                 Skills
                                 ------

The Grunts trainer teaches skills in the same way as a normal adventurers
guild does, using <learn> and <improve>.

The path for the Grunts trainer: /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/npc/trainer.c
He teaches skills in the room:   /d/Emerald/common/guild/grunts/room/train.c

The skills that are taught in by the trainer are not taught above the levels
found in other adventurers guild. Also, the trainer is not fussy who he 
teaches (as long as they have the cash!), thus avoiding any nasty taxes. 
He teaches the following skills:

    Skill            Max Level
    -----            ---------
    
    club                 30
    polearm              30
    unarmed combat       30
    defence              20
    blindfighting        20

    awareness            30
    appraise enemy       30
    climb                30
    swim                 30
                        ---
    Total:              250  (150 less than the maximum allowed of 400)

Thats about it, really. Many thanks to the people who have contributed to this
guild, who include (not in any order, and I've probably forgotten some) Quis,
Plugh, Nick, Tricky, Napture, Charon, Shiva and many others. Thank you all for 
your help and expertise!

This data is correct as of 01/04/96. As with most guilds, small modifications
and minor improvements are made continuously. Please ask Tulix if you have any
questions about what is currently implemented/being planned.
