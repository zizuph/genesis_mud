* Focus is a special skill which is used in place of magic skills.
  Since it represents what would normally be a magical element and
  a magical form skill, it is counted and taxed twice (actually,
  slightly more than twice, since I did not take adventurer guild
  levels into account).  Just for fun, the cost factor is quadrupled,
  however.
