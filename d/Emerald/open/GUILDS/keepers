                         The Keepers of Telberin
                         -----------------------

   The Keepers of Telberin are a basically religious elven racial guild. They
are followers of the elven God of Light, Telan-Ri. According to the history
available in the Castle Telberin, Telan-Ri revealed himself to the ancient
elves and told them to seek shelter and make a colony in the forests of 
Emerald. Once here, the Keepers were charged with ridding the lands of Emerald
of the creatures of darkness which inhabited the dark lands beyond Telberin,
claiming those areas for Telan-Ri.  Those who took up the cause were granted
special blessings to give them abilities to aid them in combat and healing.
Two castes emerged from this battle, Warriors and Clerics. The warriors began
using their magic to enhance their combat abilities, the clerics dashed to the
battlefield, shielding the warriors and healing the wounded. The battle was
long and the air full of the smell of the dead and dying, but in the end, the
elves prevailed. Thus was the beginning of the First of the Keepers. From
among these brave soldiers and clerics were chosen a king and queen. The
rest dubbed themselves the Keepers of Telberin; Their duty to uphold their
values and protect the city, as well as ensuring the citizens of the city
upheld the values of Telan-Ri.  Over the centuries that have passed, much of
the magical knowledge of the Keepers of Telberin has been lost, but their
pride and spirit lives on.

The Keepers of Telberin recieve the following as part of their membership:

1) Guild items
     A white sash, worn about the waist.

2) An extensive set of common and caste-specific emotions. There are quite
   a few emotions available to the Keepers of Telberin. Each caste has a set
   of emotions which are specific to the Clerics or Warriors, such as tending
   one's wounds (warriors), or praying (clerics). For a full list of these
   emotes, see the file /d/Emerald/common/guild/newkot/doc/emotions.help

3) Start location. The guild provides a start location room in the top floor
   of Castle Telberin. This room can only be reached by guild members and
   provides no facility such as a drop room or anything of that sort. Only
   guild members may start there.

4) Bulletin Board. A simple bulletin board is provided in the start room
   to aid in communication between members of the Keepers.

5) Titles. The Keepers of Telberin are provided with additional titles.
   The formula for determining the rank within the guild depends on the
   caste of the player. If the player is a warrior, then it is the highest
   weapon skill of the player combined with a weighted racial guild stat
   to produce an index into an array of titles. The clerics have the
   same functionality, only in place of the highest weapon skill, spellcraft
   is used.

The Keepers of Telberin guild is located on the third floor of Castle 
Telberin, which can be reached at the center of Telberin, in Northeast
Emerald. The following is a list of all of the rooms that are important

                    Joining the Keepers of Telberin
                    -------------------------------

	Joining the Keepers of Telberin is not as simple as it is in
most guilds. The joining is more of a ritual than anything else. According
to information available in the study on the third floor of Castle Telberin,
the player must ask Vilgurn for his blessing. This can only be done if the
player is polite enough to introduce to him and to sit at his desk before
asking for the blessing. The blessing will only be given to positively
aligned elves.
	Once the player has the blessing (the leather belt described 
above), the player can then go down to the throne room (th5.c). Depending
on whether the player wants to be a cleric or warrior, the player can
then type 'show belt to queen' or 'show belt to king', respectively. This
completes the ritual, and the royal member then gives the player the
dagger, while the guild_server.c takes care of the dirtywork of adding
the soul/shadow to the player. At this point the player is a member of
the Keepers of Telberin.
