NAME:-		Massive Raven-Beaked Warhammer
FILENAME:-	/d/Emerald/mountains/mines/wep/rb-warhammer.c
MAXHIT:-	33
MAXPEN:-	54
HIT:-		base: 27 (+1 for 50 axe skill, up to +6 for 100+ axe skill)
PEN:-		base: 54 (only if str > 124) goes down by 5/10 str below
			  down to a str of 84 where it is unwieldable)

SPECIAL:-	The warhammer has a command called 'flipgrip' where the
		wielder flips the grip 180 degrees and swings at their
		enemy with the beaked end of the hammer. It will do a
		check to see for a successful hit based on:

		hurtchance = 100 + (random(whacker->query_stat(SS_DEX)) +
		random(whacker->query_skill(SS_WEP_AXE)) +
		random(whacker->query_skill(SS_WEP_CLUB))) -
		random(whackee->query_stat(SS_DEX)) -
		random(whackee->query_stat(SS_WIS)) -
		random(whackee->query_skill(SS_DEFENCE)) -
		random(whackee->query_skill(SS_AWARENESS)) -
		random(whackee->query_skill(SS_ACROBAT));

                The hurtval (which is passed to hit_me as the wpen if
		there are no valid armours to hit on the enemy)

 hurtval = (warhammer->query_pen() + ((whacker->query_stat(SS_STR))/4));

		Any magical prop strength on the target armour is subtracted
		from the hurtvalue.

                If the magic type of the target armour is anything other
		than enchantment, and the enchantment value is greater
		than the enchantment value of the warhammer (45), the
		hit bounces off harmlessly in a shower of magic.

                Here is the code for determining how badly the special has
		damaged the hit armour.

     new_cond = old_cond + (((5 * power) - (2 * targarm->query_ac())) /
	 (targarm->query_likely_break() + targarm->query_likely_cond()));
     if(new_cond < old_cond)
       new_cond = old_cond + 1;

		It then calls a set_alarm to do the armour_break (which
		is a random chance based on how badly damaged the armour
		is)

 		The special costs 40 fatigue (if they wait the full
		80 seconds after doing it before) and 80 + the number
		of seconds left until the full recover timer (must wait
		a minimum of 20 seconds to even try it again)

PROPS:-		OBJ_I_IS_MAGIC_ARMOUR, MAGIC_AM_MAGIC,
		MAGIC_AM_ID_INFO, OBJ_S_WIZINFO

OBTAINABILITY:-	Quite difficult. Must defeat the Blackfist Clan Troll Hero
		 (400, 190, 190, 100, 100, 100) stats. At the time of
		writing, he's a little too easy, and will be bumped up.

MISC:-		Only wieldable by Humans, Elves, and Dwarves with a combined
		value of 81 or higher on Axe and Club skill and a str of
		85 + random(5). The Warhammer is 40Kg, twohanded, and the
		specials are quite fatigue-draining and are not very
		effective as just an extra-damage tool.
