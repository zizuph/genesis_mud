   Deep below the mountains of Terel lies the Utterdark.  Its tunnels lead
one to the fabled Sybarus Cavern where the Faithful dwell, cradled in the 
waters of a sunless sea.  There they pledge unquestioning loyalty to the 
Gods of Avenir, that the Source might always shed light upon Sybarus. 
The Sybarite society is a complex one in which every race fills a niche, 
and Outlanders are unwelcome due to their ignorance of and violations of 
local custom.  This is a Domain where the distinction between good and evil
is blurred--a matter of perspective.  To the Faithful, any action taken in
pursuit of the Gods' will is good, and all who oppose them are evildoers.
