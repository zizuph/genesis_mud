The Order and Paths of rooms for shiplines to and from Avenir:

To Rift of Sybarus from X:      From Rift of Sybarus to X:
  sea1                            cave2     
  sea2                            cave3
  fiss1                           fiss3
  fiss2                           fiss4
  cave1                           sea3
  cave2                           sea2

Any of these may be eliminated to make the trip shorter. If that
is desired, you might want to simply use "cave2" and "sea2", as 
they do not indicate sailing direction the way the others do. Or
simply use "cave1" and cave2" going to the Rift and "cave2" and 
"cave3" leaving it.
