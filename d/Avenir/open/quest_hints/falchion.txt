Mist dances inside the orb, forming figures and scenes. 
Deep in the Utterdark you see an altar, a spidery altar, and upon it a blood offering, still twitching     
        The flashing gleam of a basket-hilt falchion   

                      A pool of silver blood    

A blacksmith. 

And then nothing. 

The mist fills the orb and flows away, leaving it empty and dark.
