As you approach the orb flames flare up around you and you feel a presence arrive within the tower.  

Images begin flooding through your mind and most prominent is that of a pale transparent elvish ghost haunting the depths of the Underdark, longing to break his tether to this world. 

As the apparition turns toward you, you sense many foes surrounding him, dark, impish creatures which must be destroyed in order to grant him a temporary reprieve from his eternal watch over a spider-shaped altar. 

Small points of light flare in the darkness, glowing pieces of the Source, that unlock a stone. A sacrificial hammer deals devastating blows with an unseen hand, shattering statues. 

The orb fills with cobwebs and becomes inert once again.
