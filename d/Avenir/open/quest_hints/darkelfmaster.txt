You feel drawn into the orb by something dark and powerful.

You are floating past the fortress that guards the way into Sybarus, a blast of super-heated air singeing you as you travel over the glowing orange-red of an abyss.

Twisting and turning through a warren of tunnels, past shadow lizards and trolls, dark elves and chimeras, the darkness tugs you, tugs until -- with a snap -- you come to an abrupt halt before a dark elf warrior master with a heart as dark and cold as subterranean ice.

You sense he has tasks for you, if you dare approach him.
