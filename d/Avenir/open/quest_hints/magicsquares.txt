You see nothing but darkness, and then, two men. Two men, each seeking an artifact of great value deep in the bowels of the Utterdark. Their voices echo in your mind as they tell you their stories of seeking a bloody square of magic they can dispel with stones. 

There is a low passage, and a large cavern with a dais in the center. Scenes flash before your eyes    
                      Stones fall from your hands    
     ...The dais becomes a pillar, rising, rising toward the ceiling    
...A white-blue flame you cannot hold in your hands, you must guide it into    something   
           ...Artifact in hand, the only way out is up    

Darkness reigns and the orb reveals no more.
