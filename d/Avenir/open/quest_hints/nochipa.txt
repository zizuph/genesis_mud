The blurry image of the Sybarus Bazaar forms, then fades, followed by a hill with a pillory. Through a trap door you see fear on the faces of humans who have been in hiding a long while. You see a combat scene between two fierce women: A raven-haired elven warrior and a blond priestess. Blood slowly fills the orb and the vision ends.
