||                                                                 ||
||                                                                 ||
||     In ancient times, long before the gods re-shaped the world, ||
|| there existed a profoundly beautiful and peaceful land.  It was ||
|| an isolated land bounded by impassable mountains and a sea from ||
|| which none who ventured to cross its waters ever returned.      ||
|| Great forests covered the lower slopes of the mountains, giving ||
|| way to a deep and verdant valley.  Through this valley wound    ||
|| streams which delivered waters both hot and cold into the Great ||
|| Sea, here and there forming islands and marshes.                ||
||     Those who dwelled in this land called it 'Avenir', a place  ||
|| that would always be, the Future.  It was home to people of     ||
|| many races--some of which are no longer known, erased as they   ||
|| were by time as surely as the writing upon parchment fades when ||
|| exposed too long to the Source.                                 ||
||     It is said by the Seers that the world was forced into a    ||
|| new shape and its heart stolen, eaten by a great gluttonous god ||
|| whose actions have been passed on through the ages, but whose   ||
|| name is no longer spoken.  In the throes of change, fires con-  ||
|| sumed the world, seas fell and deserts flooded, mountains       ||
|| crumbled and others rose. A monstrous fissure rent the land,    ||
|| opening a hole into which the Great Sea poured, hissing like a  ||
|| serpent.                                                        ||
||     The People of Avenir abandoned their valley and sought      ||
|| refuge in the mountanous caves.  Yet even there, deep in the    ||
|| living rock of the world, the acts of the Shaper had created    ||
|| havoc.  Dwarves and gnomes alike found their tunnels twisted    ||
|| beyond recognition.  New hazards confronted them; people died   ||
|| by the thousands, their lives claimed by darkness, crevices,    ||
|| projections, despair, and strange, unseen forces.               ||
||     Unbeknownst to the People, the upheaval of the re-shaping   ||
|| had awakened and liberated beings that had been trapped since   ||
|| the making of the world.  Though temporally weak, these spirit- ||
|| creatures, or 'spirit-beings' could exert themselves on the physical   ||
|| plane.  They took great delight in terrorizing their new-found  ||
|| pets, driving them into bottomless pits, acidic pools, and the  ||
|| lairs of predatory monsters.                                    ||
||     Soon the spirit-beings came to the realization that the population ||
|| of 'pets' was diminishing greatly. Between the sporting deaths  ||
|| caused by the spirit-beings, the accidental deaths, and the suicides,  ||
|| less than one-tenth of their original number remained.  Some of ||
|| of the spirit-beings, seeking to preserve their entertaining pets and  ||
|| enhance their temporal power, sought and found a place in which ||
|| the temporals could live and reproduce.                         ||
||     A large cavern, flooded with waters from the Great Sea, was ||
|| discovered.  Numerous islands projected up through the water,   ||
|| some close together, some few far enough away that they could   ||
|| not be seen from any other.  What made the cavern most fitting  ||
|| for the former surface-dwelling people was the vein of curious  ||
|| mineral which snaked its way across the ceiling.  With a small  ||
|| effort of will, the spirit-beings could make it radiate light.         ||
||     Unto the People the spirit-beings appeared, tantalizing them with  ||
|| promises of sanctuary.  They showed them images of the cavern,  ||
|| a place of safety and light. Yet the People refused the spirit-beings, ||
|| for their fear of their tormentors overpowered their desire for ||
|| a place to call home.  Days became weeks and then months, and   ||
|| still the discussion raged.  Scores of people died in that time ||
|| and still the racial leaders digressed.  Verily, it was the sad ||
|| death of the last of the hobbits that shocked the leaders of    ||
|| the remaining races into accepting the offer of Sanctuary.      ||
||      With the spirit-beings a pact was made.  The People swore them-   ||
|| selves, their children, and their children's grandchildren in   ||
|| eternal servitude to the spirit-beings. They offered their bodies up   ||
|| for possession, their seed for manipulation, and their wills to ||
|| the spirit-being's whimsy.  In exchange the spirits promised that the  ||
|| cavern would be a place of sanctuary, well-lit and undisturbed  ||
|| by future Shapings.  Never again would the People have to flee  ||
|| their home, so long as they upheld the pact.                    ||
||                                                                 ||
||     And so it came to be that cavern and all it contained was   ||
|| named Sybarus, the tunnels from which the People had been safe- ||
|| ly delivered were named the Unterdark, and that which sheds     ||
|| its light upon the People revered as the Source.  The People    ||
|| called themselves the Faithful, and all who had not sworn the   ||
|| Oaths were given the same name as those who had broken them:    ||
|| Infidel.                                                        ||
||                                                                 ||

|| Addendum:                                                       ||
|| Do note that Barouke and his master, Seer Haime, were Executed  ||
