The files you are interested in are:
	silkshop.c       -- The shop
        silkstore.c      -- The store room
        silkseller.c     -- The shopkeeper npc
        blouse.c        
        trouser.c

To visit the avenir shop, go to: 
	/d/Avenir/common/bazaar/intr/silkseller.c
        
You can ignore the bazaar.h  I think -- just use your domain's usual
*.h files for the defines you need. IF you have a question, just ask.

Feel free to continue to use the Avenir inherits if it simplifies 
things for you. The shop code we use is borrowed from Gondor, I
believe. It handles signs and npc-linking to the shop, etc.

~avenir/inherit/cloth_arm can be substituted with /std/armour.
