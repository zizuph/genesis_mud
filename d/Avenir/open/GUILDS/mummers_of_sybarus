Mummers of Sybarus has opened.             41 Lilith      Wizard     Sep  9

A minor guild, the Mummers of Sybarus, was opened in Avenir today.

It is located in the Sybaurs Bazaar. Players my join, leave, and
restore guild objects at ~Avenir/common/bazaar/extr/str5 where
the npc called Nygel (~Avenir/common/clubs/mummer/nygel) is located.
Those who join receive a mummer's cap (~Avenir/common/clubs/mummer/
mum_cap) as the guild object.

As a minor guild it offers nothing in the way of combat aid to 
members so there is no tax on experience. It does prevent speech
when players are miming: This is not a bug ;)

      mcap       Make the prongs of your cap bounce and jingle.
