--------
OVERVIEW
--------
  The Union of the Warriors of Shadow is an original guild, not based on
any novels or other gaming themes. They are a school of warriors that
were origionally founded to be the elite guard for the royalty of Sybarus 
City in Avenir, and have since branched out to form their own Union, 
almost a cult even, based on pride, dignity, grace, and power.

----------
FILE NAMES
----------
   The following file names are of particular importance:
~Avenir/union/list              Master object for the Union

~Avenir/union/room/pendentive   The join/leave room
~Avenir/union/room/guild        The start room & where the guild flame is
~Avenir/union/room/train        Training room for the Union
~Avenir/union/room/white             ""
~Avenir/union/room/forge             ""
~Avenir/union/room/alcove            ""
~Avenir/union/room/library           ""
~Avenir/union/room/council      Room were Elect & Elder commands are performed

~Avenir/union/obj/stone         The guild token
~Avenir/union/shadow            The guild shadow
~Avenir/union/occ_soul          The guild soul

  The Union soul includes the following files in ~Avenir/union/lib/:
attack.h        The functions for the special attacks 'fling' and 'slash'
ability.h       The functions for the abilities 'contrast' and 'sway'
emotions.h      All the emotions of the Union
filters.h       Various filters and miscellaneous functions
help.h          The help files
language.h      The code for the Union tongue

-----------------
JOINING THE UNION
-----------------
  To join the Union, the player must first find the guildhall, which
is hidden deep in the Underdark tunnels of Avenir. The guildhall
was origionally in Sybarus City, but repeated attempts by Infidel 
revolutionaries to destroy it forced it to move 'underground',
thus making it somewhat difficult to find. Once granted leave, the 
player may join in ~Avenir/union/room/pendentive, where he can 'reach 
within the stone', to obtain one of the entry quests. 
The player must obtain the approval of the Elders by mailing an 
application to the 'voice' at the Union post office. A quest is given
to those who are approved for entry. When the quest is solved,
and if the player not a goblin or dwarf (races which are seen as too 
clumsy to be a proper member), the player can then join the Union.
A member of the Union will have the guild shadow ~Avenir/union/shadow.c,
the command soul ~Avenir/union/occ_soul.c, and the guild token,
~Avenir/union/obj/stone.c

-----------------
LEAVING THE UNION
-----------------
  A player may at any time leave the Union by doing 'betray the union'
in the pendentive. Death is the penalty for leaving of your own
accord. The player will have been previousley aware of this, because
it is written on the pillar in the pendentive. The player also loses 
all the guild skills associated with the Union, and has a bit set that
prevents him from ever joining the Union again. The stat SS_OCCUP is 
also cleared.

-------------------
SKILLS IN THE UNION
-------------------
  The maximum possible skills to train are defined in the file 
~Avenir/union/lib/skills.h, and it is that file that should be altered 
should the skill levels need to be changed for any reason. Most of the 
skills cannot be trained up to maximum immediatley, but are limited by 
various stats, mostly SS_OCCUP, but also some require SS_WIS and SS_DEX 
as well. The following skills are available to train in the Union guild 
hall in various places:

-----------------
SPECIAL ABILITIES
-----------------
  The following special abilities are available for members of the Union:

Usay <what>: This is the special language for the Union. It can be 
   understood automaticaly by other members of the guild, or bits of it 
   can be understood by non-members if your language ability is high enough.

Sway: The 'sway' is a sort of trance that a member of the Union can make 
   himself fall into, provided he is not already in combat, he is rested 
   enough, and has enough mana. It is _not_ a spell, but rather a sort of 
   higher mental state, in which the skill SS_AWARENESS and the stat DEX 
   are raised, and the props LIVE_I_QUICKNESS and LIVE_I_SEE _DARK are
   added to the player. True masters of the sway are granted a brief 
   LIVE_I_SEE_INVIS of one level if they are lucky. 
   Limitations: The sway cannot be entered if the fire in the start room 
   has gone out, if the player is in combat, if the player is too tired, 
   or if the player is drunk (The idea behind not entering it while in 
   combat is that it is meant to be used as a preparation for combat, and 
   requires a massive amount of concentration to fall into. The player must 
   shut his eyes to go into it, and thus is blinded for 10 seconds). 
   The skill for the sway is no. 139050

---------------
SPECIAL ATTACKS
---------------
  The following special attacks are available for members of the Union:

Slash <enemy>: This is a general special attack that requires that
   the warrior is wielding both a sword and a knife at the same time.
   The attack is one that uses both weapons together, such as
   feinting with the sword which stabbing in low with the knife, etc.
   The skill for slash is no. 139051, and it is evaluated
   together with the warrior's SS_WEP_SWORD and SS_WEP_KNIFE against
   the enemy's SS_DEFENCE, SS_DEX, and SS_PARRY to determine the
   success of the attack.

Fling <knife> at <enemy>: This is a missile attack, where the warrior
   throws a knife or dagger at the enemy, doing damage. It is
   a rather powerful attack, limited by the result of the knife
   being moved into the inventory of the enemy if the hit is
   successful (if he misses, the knife will either land in the
   warrior's room, or fly off into an adjacent room), as well
   as the knife becoming more and more dull as it hits more. The
   skills used are the warrior's SS_FLING, SS_WEP_KNIFE, and
   SS_DEX evaluated against the enemy's SS_DEFENCE, SS_DEX and
   SS_PARRY. The attack will be much less effective if the
   player is drunk or is too loaded down with weight. The skill
   for fling is no. 139052.

------------------------
THE COUNCIL OF THE UNION
------------------------
  The council of the Union consists of one Elect, the master of the
Union, and three Elders. When there is no Elect, the Elders themselves
are able to perform all the of the most powerful commands. Otherwise,
only the Elect is able to banish members, etc. The Elders are able
to declare people are allies or enemies of the Union (with the
result that the players will be treated differently by the NPC's
in the Halls, and enemies will not be allowed to pass through the
gate), as well as accept people for membership into the Union.
Council commands can be performed at ~Avenir/union/room/council.

     Max OCC Skill Slots:              543 - 550 (max)  =   7 left 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Taxable abilities:

Slash & Fling: 10.5% See ~Avenir/union/doc/combat for a breakdown
  of the calculation for the combat aid.

Sway: 8.85% See ~Avenir/union/doc/sway for information.

Shops, pubs, &ct:
   While there are npcs in the guildhall that sell items only to
members of the Union and those who have been declared as friends
of the Union, they give no special discounts to members, and
the items are in no way special (light armours, knives, knapsacks,
torchs, etc.) There are no pubs in the guildhall. The Union has no
tell line or rebootable weapon rack.

Tax reductions:
   While it is possible for a member of the Union to consume
alcohol, his specials fling, slash, and sway will be adversly
affected by it, proportional to how drunk you are (if you are
at 100% intox, you will always miss with the specials). You also
may not enter the Sway if you are more than 40% max intox. 
Additionally, drinking lowers the member's level of purity, 
and they are commanded to remain pure at all times. Since alcohol
itself is such a massive combat aid for the rest of the game,
I reduce tax by 2% because of it. Additionally, specials are
severely impaired when the player is encumbered.
