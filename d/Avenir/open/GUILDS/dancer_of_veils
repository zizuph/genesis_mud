Dancer of Veils                                Grace       Nov 16 1995

A minor guild, the Dancers of Veils, was opened in Avenir today.
It is located in the Sybarus Bazaar. The joinroom and startloc is
	~Avenir/common/clubs/dance/clubroom

As a minor guild it offers nothing in the way of combat aid to 
members so there is no tax on experience.

The females who join receive two guild objects, several emotes, 
and an improvement in their appearance (They look like the image 
of perfection to themselves and others). When the player leaves 
the club, the original appearance is restored. 

In accordance with the theme of Avenir, only female humans, elves, and
gnomes may join. Hobbits are not real to the Sybarites, and dwarves
and goblins lack the physical grace.

Dancers of the Veil have the following abilities:
