Proposed Guild in Avenir			Lilith April 2002

Name:  Anchorites of Sybarus
Dir:   /d/Avenir/anchor/*
Type:  Layman			
Style: Cleric
Tax:   10%

Theme: 
The Idrys (gods) of Avenir are multiple and manifest in their glory. 
They each have their own personality, sphere of influence, and demands.
By their grace alone does Sybarus exist and continue to exist, and
the people of Sybarus are never allowed to forget this. The Anchorites
administer to the Gods, attending to their demands, and acting as a
buffer between the Gods and the People. It is they who perform the
ceremonies and rituals to honour and appease the Gods. In exchange
for their devotion they are granted spells and abilities which they 
are expected to demonstrate in order to remind all who encounter 
them of the power and glory of the Idrys.

Organization:
The Anchorites are a fellowship of clerical sects each dedicated to a 
single god.  At this time only 4 sects are planned, but the intention 
is to code the guild in such a way that more Anchorite sects can be 
added with minimum effort, as desired. 

	Entrance: Entrance will be by quest. There will be no player-
mediated entrance process.

	Leaving:  Leaving the guild causes the displeasure of the Gods
and will result in the individual being smited by Plalgus. This is
a minor curse already in effect in the game which marks the person 
as infidel for a period of time. There is no other penalty.

   	Council:  Code will be in place for a council, but it is hoped
that it will not be needed. If activated, each sect will have one 
Anchor, chosen by the code (gods) upon login of a suitable-level 
candidate.  That candiate would serve for a period of 12 days, at
which time the player would be relieved of his duties and the next 
person of suitable level to login would then become Anchor. This is
a truly democratic process which should combat the problem of 
entrenched guild leadership and political agendas.

	Membership restrictions: This is a lay guild, so restrictions
will be kept to a minimum. All genders and all races save hobbits, 
kenders, minotaurs and other future grotesques will be welcomed. 
Member-member conflict will be permitted, but it is likely that repeat
offenders will find themselves in the unpleasant position of facing 
the Patron of someone they have killed. 

	Requirements: While it is understood that a lay guild should 
not make excessive demands on players, members will be required to
complete tasks assigned by npcs in order to advance to the next level
in the guild.  Acts of devotion will also improve their standing in
the guild and in the esteem of their Gods. Additionally, players will
have to visit the scriptorium at the guild halls to copy their spells
onto scrolls. Players will be able to leave a sect without leaving 
the guild, in the event they find themselves drawn to serve another.

	
Spells: 
As this is a lay guild, only spells up to level 3 are offered. This
guild would mark a departure from the current magic guild structure 
in that players would be able to choose a limited number of spells
from a greater 'library' of spells, based upon their level within 
the guild and the class of the spells themselves. This provides a
wider variety of spells and would permit players to choose spells
based upon what they intended to do during a specific login. Taxes,
then, are decided based upon the maximum number of spells permitted 
in each class, as shown:
	Class 1		4 spells	@	.25 = 1.0%
	Class 2		3 spells 	@	.50 = 1.5%
	Class 3 	2 spells 	@	1.0 = 2.0%	
	---------------------------------------------------	
	Maximum		9 spells		    = 4.5%	
       		    (excluding cantrips)

Spells will be in the form of scrolls. Members must obtain the 
vellum, quill, and ink, as well as access to the scriptorium in order 
to copy the spells they wish to use. Spell scrolls will be randomly recoverable, requiring members to visit the guild halls and make
new scrolls frequently, but not so often as to interfere with the
function of those who are in occupational guilds.

Skills:  
The training of specific forms and elements will vary according
to the Sect the player chooses. However, the following table is 
indicative of what each sect will have:
