   Someone stole the Hegemon's scepter and awakened him from his rest. Kill the
thief and bring back the pieces of the scepter to him.

Simple enough, right? Well, simpler than the Banshee's Mask, but the same basic
difficulties apply. 3 boats to get there. Then you've got to find the 1 room in
the 140 accessible to you that has the Hegemon's ghost, wading your way through
aggressive revenants and exit-blocking skeletons. After you talk to the Hegemon
you have to go find the gnomish thief who was cloned to a random place in the 
catacombs, kill her, and bring the pieces of his scepter back to him to get 
your reward.

Questor will take extensive damage and must kill at least one npc.

This quest is technically the first stage of the Meet Mascarvin Quest,
since the Hegemon shows the player how to get to her quest area through an 
opening in his room after they help him.
