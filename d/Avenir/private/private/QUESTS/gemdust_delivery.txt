Gemdust Delivery:

Lyrelle is in urgent need of gemdust to make her famous body
lotions. However, her sole supplier, Imlis of the lapidary in
the bazaar, is running behind on his deliveries because of the
popular demand for his brand new gem-laden money purses.

Player can either learn of the quest from Lyrelle or from Imlis.
It is intended they learn from Imlis at first as a sort of intro
to the fact that the Ziggurat is now partially available for
exploration.

Upon asking about 'quest' or 'task', Imlis will give the player
a pouch of various varieties of dust, they must then bring this
to Lyrelle in the ziggurat for a reward.

This quest may be done multiple times, they though will only
ever receive one gemdust pouch at a time, and subsequent solvings
will yield only a 25% chance of a sybarun token as reward.
Only the first time yields experience, of course.
