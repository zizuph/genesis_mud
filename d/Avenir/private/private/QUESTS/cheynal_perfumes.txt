Cheynal Perfumes:
----------------

Cheynal will be willing to make specially commissioned 
perfumes for players, but she needs some help getting
ingredients. She gives the player a list of 5+ items
that are generated randomly for each player.

Some of these items may be found outside sybarus, mainly
herbs. Once the player completes the list and brings
back all the items, s/he receives a modest reward and
is able to access the special perfumes.

The player will have the duration of a reboot to try and
complete their list, upon the next, they will need to
start over with a new list.
