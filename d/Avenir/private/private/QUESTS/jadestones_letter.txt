Letter quest:
If a player asks Jadestone for a quest, will tell him or her that
she needs a letter delivered to Galerin, on the Holm.

The Holm is dangerous, and so are the nobles there, of which 
Galerin is one.  The difficulty is increased because the nobles
identities are randomly generated, and at any given time there
is no guarantee that Galerin can be found to deliver the letter 
to.

Once the player has given the letter to Galerin, he asks them
to wait so he can write a response, which must be returned to
Jadestone in order for the player to get the experience.
