Plans quest:
If a player asks Jadestone for a quest, She will tell him or her 
that she needs to know what the infidel plans are.

This quest requires combat.
The player must first slay the frightened infidel who is sneaking
around, to get the key to the infidel hideout. Then he or she 
must find the room in the hideout where the table is, and slay
the people there before s/he can get the plans.

If the player retuns the plans to Jadestone, she will give a reward.
