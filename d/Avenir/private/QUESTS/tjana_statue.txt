Tjana Statue:
----------------

Reading the book in the Bazaar library about Tjana will add a prop to the player
that s/he is on working on the Quest.

Some of the npcs will answer questions about Tjana, pointing to other npcs, 
until the player reaches the traveling merchant on the holm, who will give 
shard #6 to the player.

One of the shards is always in the same place (the stump) and the other four
pieces are scattered randomly in four different areas of the island.

The pieces are heavy and the player can only carry them if 70% of his carrying
capacity is available. 

As more pieces are collected, the player feels them drawing closer together,
until finally once all of the pieces are together, they magically reassemble
into the Statue of Tjana. Player gets 7000 exp when this happens, and the 
blessing of Azauph Maternal who was her parent (a whistle that calls orphan
messengers?)

The statue drops out of the player inventory and then becomes immovable. After
an hour or two Nitikas appears in his humanoid form (a small and withered
humanoid with very large teeth and ribs that protrude grotesquely from
his body) to collect the statue (it is of surpassing beauty) and Azauph 
appears in all her Maternal glory and seething rage, and screams that 
Nitikas shall not have Tjana. As it ascends into the air, she casts 
lightning that splits the statue asunder again, re-setting the quest.
