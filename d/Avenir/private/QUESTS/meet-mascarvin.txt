     Solve the puzzles and the maze, Meet Mascarvin, and get your just reward.

This quest can be done in stages, meaning, if they need to leave they can go
back to the area for this quest and be automatically moved to the stage
they left off at. 

So by now, the questor is used to taking the 3 boats to get to the Necronisi,
(there is no magic teleporting in) and they've started learning their way 
around the catacombs, and they've done the quest for the Hegemon's Ghost, and 
their reward is a chance to meet the goddess Mascarvin. 

The daughter of Mascarvin, Goddess of Death and rebirth, fell in love with
this Hegemon (Manis-ak) and he and Azeuph had a daughter together whom they
named Tjana. (Their story can be found in the Bazaar Library... I wrote it
20-25 years ago). Perhaps because of their shared tragedy of losing Tjana to 
Nitikas and Azeuph to grief-induced madness, Manis-Ak and Mascarvin became
close enough that even after his death, she keeps him near and visits with 
him.

So it is that, once you've helped the Hegemon's Ghost (Stage 1), he will point
out the opening in the wall of his tomb (crypt_s7) that leads toward Mascarvin.
Entering the slit between the bones, you land in /dead/mascarvin/spots.c.
This room is perfectly round, with a stone block in the center, patterns of 
little bone disks in the floor, and 12 rectangular panels spaced evenly 
around the room. No matter how you try to examine the pattern, you 
won't be able to make it out until you've put a lighted torch into the 
stone block to help you see better. Once you do that, you'll see something
that looks like this: ... :..: :::: ...:..., etc. These are sets of dots
ranging between 1 and 12 (for each of the panels) and you need to push the
panels in the order they appear in the pattern. It is random and the pattern
changes whenever the last person leaves the room. You will know you've done
it right when you hear a rumble and an opening appears to the east. (Stage 2 
complete!)

The next room, passage.c is a transition room. This is where players see that
the walls have etchings on them, supposedly from people trying to figure out 
the way through the maze. This room also has a "passage" written on the walls
that provides a hint to mark the Gods and the Path (the names on the threshold
and the exits taken should be taken down by the player, they will need them).

From there you can walk east to the next room, chalice.c. This room is 
deceptively empty except for a circle of stones that looks like a well.
Enter the well, and you enter the maze.

 --- MAZE ---
The first thing to know about the maze is that if a player gets lost or 
frustrated they can just reach/jump/leap/enter the ever-present mist and it 
will transport them back to the room where the entrance to the maze is
(chalice.c) It is 12 rooms. The next thing to know about the maze is that the
path is static until reboot, so if a player gets lost, or re-starts, the exits
won't change on them until Armageddon comes. BUT the names on the stone 
thresholds do change every time someone goes back to the beginning (maze1). 
So if someone gets through the maze and gets to the skull room and doesn't have 
the words on the threshold written down in the right order/number, the player 
can go back to the beginning and use the path they figured out, then track the
words as they use the exits, so they can solve the next puzzle, with the skulls.
(end Stage 3)

Upon going down the stairs into skull.c, you will see a room with twelve skulls
arranged in a circle, "gleaming dully". This is a hint. Each skull bears a name
or set of hyphenated names and you need to polish/clean/rub/touch the skulls
with the right names in the right order. Sometimes the same name will be 
repeated and you just polish that skull again. I had a list with: Cahor-Tarob 
Zaren Sabrus Cahor-Tarob Nitikas-Zahun Nitikas-Zahun Cahor-Tarob Tabris-Zeffar 
Sair-Salilus Tacritan-Zizuph Tacritan-Zizuph. So I examined the skulls, did 
"read letters on first skull" through twelfth skull, and then polished the 
skulls one by one starting with the one on the first doorway I went through. 
The player gets a message that "A thrill of adrenaline rushes through you as 
you realize that you're closer than ever to meeting Mascarvin" and a doorway 
opens west. (end Stage 4).

At this point the puzzles and quest portion is done. The player just needs to
walk through the doorway to meet Mascarvin. What they do in her sanctuary
determines what happens next for them. 

Shortly after a questor walks through her door, Mascarvin must leave to gather 
a dying Sybarite, leaving them in the room with a table full of goodies. A 
honeypot. Right now, there are 3 possible scenarios. The first is that the 
player minds their manners and don't touch things w/o invitation. They get the
full quest exp, and the items from Her table if they want them. The second is 
that they are disrespectful to Her, which she interprets as a death wish 
(who insults or gets handsy the goddess of death?) and they get a very small 
amount of quest exp and they die in the pit of despair. The third is that they 
get greedy and steal from her table, so she lectures them, robs them of their 
belongings, and leaves them to die in the pit of despair.

This is a major quest with two unique puzzles, a 12 room maze, plus risk of 
losing all their inventory and/or dying. There is no combat in the quest 
area itself but players will have to fight their way through the catacombs 
to get to it. Solving this quest will be a significant investment of time.
