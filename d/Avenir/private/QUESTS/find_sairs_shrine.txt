Find Sair's Shrine -- by Lilith Sep 2021
Exp   500
Group 1
Bit   14

This is a simple "tour" type quest in the Port area.
No one gives it out, but a few npcs will drop hints.
Find the shrine to Sair and make an offering, and she may bless you.
But this is more challenging than it sounds, of course.

Sair is the Goddess of the First Hour (She shares this Hour with Salilus).
Sair is the Goddess of Walls and Obstacles. She is worshipped/placated in
Sybarus to keep walls from crumbling/collapsing, and as someone who can
place or remove obstacles from one's path. Sair is a giantess of sorts,
massive and lumpy and stone-like, incredibly strong, with fire-opals for 
eyes. (For more info on her, see the Avenir doc dir).

When the Port was being built, a giant octagonal crystal was discovered. 
Such things are considered Sacred to Sair, and so a shrine was chiseled out
around it. People wanting to appease Sair or seek her blessings will go to
this remote little shrine and pray or make offerings of fire opals (sacred
to Sair). Her blessing is +5 STR and +5 Earth spell for 30-45 mins.

Throughout Avenir, octagons (symbol of Sair) have be etched/carved/chiseled 
into the tunnel walls and built walls, a way of dedicating them to Sair and 
asking her blessing to strengthen them. Some of these octagons can be activated
using fire opals, and when activated, Sair grabs the player and pulls them 
through the wall into another place. Sometimes there is just one possible 
destination, sometimes there are many. 

There are some of these Sair Walls scattered in the Port area. The room with
the Sair Shrine is only accessible through activating a Sair Wall, and that
room can only be accessed by a Sair Wall that has more than one destination 
in the area, so players are going to have to keep trying various combinations
until they get lucky. They will be moved by Sair to other places within the 
Port/Ledge area, where there isn't anything particularly dangerous to smaller
players.
