Ry'nal's Gift:
-------------

As part of his plan to woo Lyrelle, Ry'nal has commissioned a 
prety diadem for her. In an attempt to keep her from finding it,
he asked Cahor to hide it from site. She did so, making it 
invisible, but then Ry'nal dropped it somewhere. Oh no! The
player's mission is to find the diadem and bring it back to 
Ry'nal.

The player gets the quest from Ry'nal. S/He must then find
the altar to Cahor and recieve her blessing in order to 
be able to see the diadem. The diadem is invisible and 
Cahor's blessing will temporarily give the player the 
ability to see it.

Finding the altar is a challenge. The player must first
figure out to pass through the illusionary wall on the
second level of the Ziggurat and then find the incantation
writen on a brick on the wall which will reveal the altar.
The player must have sufficient language skill to read 
the incantation.

Once the altar is revealed, they must worship to obtain
Cahor's blessing. With the blessing, they can find the
diadem placed at a random position somewhere in the
ziggurat. They can then pick it up and take it to
Rynal for a small reward.
