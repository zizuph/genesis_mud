Crypt Brainstorm:

Overall effect... silence. Despite momentary scares (such as
a door suddenly swinging open...) i want this space to be
a mostly tell_room free area.

secret tunnel.
a boarded up secret entrance or passageway.
leads to the murder mystery areas described below.

Is there a death god?
Mascarvin, Female, sybol: Grinning skull


rotting, decaying bodies.
cobwebs, dust, rats, snakes, bugs, roaches?, spiders

perhaps, opening a certain chamber causes a load of rats
to come pouring out.

Death chambers for the very rich of Sybarite society.
Perhaps, similar to Egyptian Pyramids in that
they prepare the chamber as if it were a place of life.


Death rituals?
What do Sybarite's believe happens after death?



A murder mystery?
Woman was chained or trapped?, and buried alive?
She tried to scratch her way out through the rock.
Blood stains along the wall from her fingertips.

A man was torchured by hanging him by his tongue on
a rusty meat hook. The sound of the hook squeeking can
be heard for several rooms around it... even though there
is no wind.

A dismembered body scattered throughtout.


Other Thoughts.... 
A seer was torchered.... hmm..
Eyes torn out.

LAYOUT OF CRYPT:

Candleabras line the walls.

The newest bodies are up front.
The older bodies are near the back.
Richest people have entire rooms for themselves.
Favorite servants get buried with them in a foyer in front of their room.
All the wives of a rich man, get buried in a room to themselves.
First or favorite wives are clad in more jewlrey.
Rich women are clad in webcloth? death shawls and veils.

Rooms have wardrobes for the clothes, and mirrors that are
_NOT_ covered. They are fully furnished.

Children have nursery type rooms with toys, and rocking chairs.



HAUNTED.
Water dripping.
A faint scream.
A soft humming.
The sound of someone's voice echoing down the hall.
The sound of footsteps running down the tunnel.
Hearing something heavy being dragged across the floor.
Something cold brushes against your face.
Sounds of scratching being heard.
The sound of a child crying.
Something (female for men, male for women) whispers the player's name.
A sweet glowing figure beckons you into a trap.
A crying woman who dissappears shortly after you enter room.
The image of a little girl happily eating the fingers on a hand,
  then innocently asking you if you would like a bite.
You see a figure grinning at you from behind, when you examine a mirror.
Rocking chairs rock.
Toys fall off the death beds of children, spontaneously.

A Wicked Dagger:
-someone committed suicide with it.
-blood red.
-magical type of dagger.
-once wielded, it will possess player and cause them to slit their own
 wrists. (eeks.)
-player is warned... a Ghost story book in the library?
-dagger is wrapped in a webcloth scroll?


BOOK OF GHOST STORIES:
Found in the library.
Tells the story of the Star Crossed Scribe?
Includes the story of the Wicked Dagger.
Key to the gate in front of the Crypt falls out of it.

TRAP:
For women, a man spirit beckons them.
"A blue, glowing figure forms from the mist. His dark eyes looking "
straight at you. You feel you have known him all your life."
He says: "Sirra, I knew you would come to me. I have been watching you 
  and waiting. Follow me, my love."
He then beckons her straight to a room where she falls into a hole.
No exits. Must quit out. (Yuck. Will think of something better. Boron had
some good ideas. :)

For men, a female spirit beckons them.
"A softly lit glowing figure forms from the mist. Her gentle dress 
falling about her white skin in waves. She appears to have been crying."
She says: "YourName, I have been waiting for you. I thought you 
would not come to me. Follow me, my love."
And the rest comes naturally. 



***NEED A QUEST TO ORGANIZE THE LAYOUT AROUND.***

Ghost type quest... lovers parted through tragic death.

Perhaps a ring on the dead finger of someone.

Indianna Jones type adventure... hmm..




***HISTORY OF THE CATACOMBS***

During Terfellis' time, the Infidels used the caverns as a hide out.
Terfellis had it flooded to force them out. Those who didnt rush to 
the surface to be captured and executed, were violently drowned by the
flood.

Terfellis had dungeons built in the caverns to house infidels and 
those suspected of crimes against the gods. Torchure being the 
tool of coercion.

The dungeons were abandoned as the infidel uprising was supressed, and
the space was converted to lavish burial chambers.

Ironically, Terfellis was the first to be buried there.

Later, during who's time?, it was discovered that Outlanders in league
with Infidel revolutionaries were using the abandoned area of the 
catacombs as a "half-way" house to smuggle stolen slaves out of
Syberus (for re-sale in the outer world?).

Result: The dungeon areas were closed off. And the catacombs were no
longer used for burial.
 

***TIMELINE NOTES****
65    Eli Ni'stu dies of unknown causes. His daughter, Llinisa Ersin, 
            takes on the role of Commissioner.
101  Llinisa Ersin slain by the Demon Plalgus (see book on Plalgus), leaving
            no heir. Her brother, Manis-Ak Rishtu, becomes next High
            Commissioner.
119  The islands of the bazaar and city become too crowded to bury the dead,
            so a barren, uninhabited island is found where all the dead
            will be henceforth transported to. The island is named the
            Necronisi, the Island of the Dead.
124  To combat increasing unrest of the the people, Terfellis, a distant
            cousin of Eli Ni'stu, is appointed to the job of pacifying/suppressing
            the people. His titles becomes High Inquisitor.
135  The bridge between the bazaar island and the park island is built, the park
            island becomes the leisure and hunting grounds for the royalty
            of Sybarus.
163  Terfellis orders the execution of the Cult of the Scribes, in retalliation
            to certain publications they put forth (see book on Nantur)
165  Eli Ni'stu dies of natural causes, and his inept son, Origin S'ali, becomes
            the new High Commissioner. He quickly becomes a mere 
            pawn of Terfellis, and his office loses power. From then on,
            the office of the High Inquisitor would be the real power in
            Sybarus, and the office of High Commissioner would be
            little more than a beaurocratic system of petty law making.
168  First uprising of the Infidels, a small group of humans, gnomes, and
            dwarves against the tyranny of the Inquisitor. First rebellion
            is brutally put down by Terfellis, but the movement goes
            underground (literally) and begins to gain symapthy and
            momentum.
169  Passage through the Unterdark to northern Terel discovered. Toril
            sees contact with the Outside as a threat to his power, and
            writes the Edict of Isolation, which states that on pain of
            death, no contact with the outside world is permitted by
            any citizen of Sybarus, and all Outsiders are to be slain
            should they enter the domain. Outpost fortress built at the
            edge of the Dark Sea to prevent access (in and out) to
            Sybarus.
170  Terfellis appoints his assistant, Toril, to the newly created 
            position of High Executioner to deal with the inreasing
            problem of the Infidels.
175  After an assasination attempt by a dwarven Infidel disguised as a palace guard,
            Toril appoints his brother Akram to start a training school for
            an elite elven guard, assigned to protect the royalty of
            Sybarus.
176  The Demon Hahabi becomes the patron of the Executioners.
178  Akram expands the training school for elite guards to a general elite
            fighting force, used for putting down uprisings and secretive
            operations. The school is named the Union of the Warriors of
            Shadow, since their operations take place in darkness.
186  After multiple attempts by Infidel revolutionaries to destroy the training
            school of the Union, Akram moves the school to a secret location in
            the Unterdark and continues training. The school becomes less and
            less associated with the sole protection of the royalty, and
            more becomes a training school for mercenaries, although they
            still suppy the elite guard of the royalty.
197  Terfellis dies of natural causes. His brother, Fantig Qa, becomes
            the next High Inquisitor.




***PLIGHT OF A STAR-CROSSED SCRIBE***

> Lilith says: The Seers are priests of Schlachlil.
Lilith says: They stare into the Source, seeking revelatioons from Him.
Lilith says: Each Seer has atleast one amanuensis...a scribe-slave...
Lilith says: Who jots down the things the Seers say (and sometimes sing) when
they are staring at teh Source.
Lilith says: They are Oracles, of a sort.
Lilith says: People are impelled by soemthing 'within' to become Seers.
Lilith says: Years of staring into the Source makes them blind, and eventaully
mad.
Lilith says: They are highly respected.
Lilith says: Holy, basically.
Lilith says: The Seers have their own island.
> Lilith says: It is near the wall of the cavern, where the Source is a wide
band.
> Lilith says: Seers are rarley seen off their islands, except when in service
to a House, ot when compelled to be something they See.
Lilith says: err  or commpelled to leave the island by something they see :)
Lilith says: Most people are born into a House, and remain in it for
generations.
Lilith says: Thus, a Seer serves his House, and the Patrons of that House, even
when he is a Priest of Schlachlil.
> Lilith says: Much of the conflict in the Sybarite society is the inner-
conflict over the demands of the Gods.
You say: ok, ideas in the making atm are... a female Seer was torchured by The
High Inquisitor (Terrellis... spelling, I am unsure of)in the catacombs.... 
You say: her eyes were torn out.
Lilith says: Terfellis, I think.
You say: A man (perhaps her lover? perhaps her scribe?)was in love with her....
You say: her death, he could not bear... so he went in search of her.
You say: eventually he found her body, abandoned in a pit in the catacombs.
You say: his love for her and loyalty to her went beyond life... so...
You say: so, he trapped himself with her body, and what was left of his supplies.
You say: and he wrote a day by day account of waiting for death to bring him to
her once more.
Lilith says: Well, to build on what you started with...
Lilith says: Lets say that the Seer was taken in for questioning on suspicion
of Heresy.
Lilith says: And the seer is held for a long time... the other seers send her
amanuensis to inquire after her (as there has been no proclamation from any
Office as to her status)
Lilith says: And the amanuensis is told that she was released some time ago, to
return to the island.
Lilith says: So they look everywhere and turn up nothing.
Lilith says: Now maybe one of them gets a revelation about it, or maybe the
amanuensis just gets suspicious.
Lilith says: But he sneaks onto the Necronisi and finds her there, along with
the Inquisitors other discards.
> Lilith says: So he writes things..
Lilith says: The journal could be filled with all sorts of things..
Lilith says: perhaps small maps of areas nearby, depicting things..
Lilith says: a small treasure here, a large stock of torches there.
> Lilith says: disjointed ramblings..
Lilith says: Ascii drawings of things...
Lilith says: (there are lots of those to be found on the net)
> Lilith says: Lots of false leads into intersting places.
> Lilith says: So then, we need to decide wat the major adventure of the place
will be.
You say: he could write bits of that part in his journal... and it would make
sense that he would write so much.
You say: do Seers marry at all?
> Lilith says: I don't see why not.
You say: he could have forgot something.... something that would tie them
together in life as well as death.... something to help him perform a wedding
ritual...
You shrug.
You say: i dont know, though...
You chew thoughtfully on your bottom lip.
> Lilith goes hmmmm.
You say: also, before i forget to ask, the amanuensis is the Head Priest?
> Lilith shakes her head in disagreement.
Lilith says: Amanuensis=scribe.

Notes:
Schachlil (the Source)

A figure in swirling cloth, with light emitting for a face, and 
light orbs held in both hands. Schachlil is a popular icon for
the household, and nearly every house has one posted where it
can be seen upon entering the home.



Timeline for Plight of Scribe:
The Seer's execution must have happened after Terfellis is 
appointed (124) and before the scribes are executed (163).
Present day is 360... Therefore this happened at least 298
years ago.


The Task to be Solved...
Perhaps her "vision" was the reason she was killed.
She was compelled to do something that the Inquisitor found threatening.
She never got the opportunity to do it.
Once the player does it, s/he releases the spirits (of the Seer,
and her scribe who waits with her) so that they can move on.


What was her vision? That it could so threaten the High Inquisitor?
-perhaps she caught onto a conspiracy?
-forsaw the execution of the scribes?
-was shown what _really_ happened to Llinisa Ersin ?


What did her vision compel her to do, that would put her life
in such danger?
-murder Terfellis? (Why didn't Plalgus do it himself?)
-confront Terfellis in an attempt to persuade him differently?

 Note: Terfellis's tomb will be located in catacombs. It could
       be a good source for info about his life.

-If this is to be a quest, must be something the player can 
recreate (i.e. do in her place. If Terfellis is dead the above 
ideas are no good).
 UNLESS... player could desecrate Terfellis' tomb in an effort
to prevent Mascarvin from nursing him back to rebirth. Hmm...
This would be hard for a player to figure out, as the notes of
the scribe would be written reguarding Terfellis as very much
alive, and the Seer's point of view would have been the same.
Plus... it's been close to 300 years that Terfellis has been
"nursing". Isnt it a bit late to stop the rebirth process?
