Legend:
% - blue barrier
B - Barracks :  Containing weapons racks, cushions for sleeping, tapestries depicting
	images of the Beast, small firepits. Containing a few Zekashri in various states
	of resting or milling about impatiently to be deployed. Should be a few with 
	low-lying tables where the warriors dine and converse.
P - Parlours : The chambers where the Feiidjin gather to dance and experience their
	hallucinatory trances. Filled with exquisite pallets, 'accesories' for their
	drugs, dancing women, slaves playing variosu instruments (I can research some
	exotic instruments, unless you have something in mind for Sybarite music?). 
	Most of the Feiidjin will be too involved in their own trances to notice
	outisders, but they might just randomaly attack if a bloodlust comes over them.
S - Slave Quarters : Where slaves and dancers are chambered. Sumptuous 'cells', the
	Zekashri treat their slaves with dignity and respect. The dancers are pampered
	by personal attendants, and seem to be fairly happy with their positions.
D - Dancer's Quarter : Where the Dancer of the Veil is chambered. A nice chamber, 
	she is not being held against her will, exactly...
M - Feiidjin Masters : The quarters for the two Feiidjin Masters, the mightiest of
	the Feiidjin warriors. They can be sitting, sipping some shroom tea and
	reading old tomes or staring meditatively at tapestries.
O - Basic Cave rooms : Fairly nondescript cave rooms, can have a random tapestry
	or torch sconce or something... maybe a wanderinf guard or twelve.
R - Rabble-rousers rooms (try saying THAT five times fast) : The large chamber where the
	Zekashri are gathered listening to the Rabble-Rouser (Y).
Y - Demagogue : The Zekashri priest who is urging the Zekashri to rise up and destroy
	the Snei. As I mentioned before, he could question the players (or summon all of
	the Zekashri in the 'R' rooms to attack any Arus Sybarites).

The rest of the rooms, any ideas? Maybe a few storerooms and lichen/fungus farms. 

Quests:
	Book Quest. The Demagogue, in his sermon, urges those who have stolen the Holy
		Book of Riiyam to return it to it's rightful place. Not much info. would be
		given, but if the players asked around, maybe to the Feiidjin Masters, they
		would discover that the Holy Book Riiyam is the book of creation for the 
		Zekashri, and contains all of their lore and history. It was stolen from 	
		them by dissenters within their own ranks, and has yet to be located. Asking
		various wandering Zekashri about it would reveal a few sheisty-looking characters
		who would evade eye contact or something like that. These are the conspirators
		who stole the book for an archaeologist (who I guess we could plant somewhere
		int he Utterdark or something), but fell to fighting amongst themselves and
		split the book by it's chapters, each conspirator carrying a chapter. Maybe
		the player could kill the Zekashri and gather the chapters, then take it to the
		Library in the Bazaar to have it bound, but when the librarian sees what book
		it is, he'd summon some guards from the Bazaar to kill the player and take the 
		book. Or something like that...

	Dancer Quest. Qalita is worried about one of her dancers, Nirmal. She has disappeared
		on a foray. Qalita won't be specific about the details of it, only that she's
		disappeared and she wants her found desperately. Now, there are two ways we can 
		do this. The first way is just a simple quest where you kill the elves or something
		like that and rescue the girl. The second way incorporates your idea of the 'Femme
		Fatale's. Nirmal was a Femme Fatale who was sent to assassinate the Demagogue of 
		the Zekashri, but instead she fell in love with him and decided to stay with 
		him and his clan. She is not being held against her will, and is beginning to train
		the Zekashri women in the arts of the Dancers and the F.F. in order to strengthen
		the resistance. She has gone renegade and is organizing like an 'anti-dancers' 
		Union. How to get her back to Qalita? Ummmm... lemme think about that one.

Well in the upcoming weeks I'll have much more time to devote. I'm going to see what I
can do about picking up a Portland overnight or two in the next coming months so that you
can look over my shoulder and slap me around a bit to get knowledge in my noggin. I'll keep
you posted with my schedule, but I figured this map would be a good starting point eh? I already
know basically how to code simple rooms and objects and stuff like that, so I guess I can start
shelling a few things out. Hope all is well for you and hope Steph is feeling alright.
BTW, pictures are now up! I'll send you the link... um, hopefully in this mail somewhere. :)
hugs and kisses!!
Scott.
