Comments on the flower system.

1)  It is no longer necessary to set the OBJ_M_NO_DROP property and then remove
    it with an alarm. When a player quits, only those items that are neither
    recovering nor autoloading will be dropped by the player.

2)  As the items are purely emotive, they should be built as wearable and
    holdable object, rather than armour and weapon.

3)  Functions that are identical for all modules, like query_recover(),
    init_arg() and query_auto_load() should be placed in flower_base.c.

4a) Function-VBFC is always to be prefered to string-VBFC. This means that
    VBFC() and VBFC_ME() really should not be used anymore unless there are
    problems. The same goes for using function-pointers with set_alarm() rather
    than strings.

4b) VBFC is used unnecessarily in the flower system, which is inefficient. VBFC
    should only be used when the value of the function call is dependant on
    factors that can change. In the case of the flower system that is not the
    case. The type or colour does not change after create_flower() has been
    called. Thus it is better to call
       set_short(colour + " " + flower_desc[type][0] + " boutonniere");
    for instance.

5)  The declaration of the mapping flower_desc in flower_base.c is wasteful as
    it will create a mapping with the same contents in every instance of the
    flower, duplicating the information unnecessarily. To solve this, we can
    do the following:

    1) Create the file flower_desc.c that only contains the declaration of the
       mapping flower_desc and a function:

       mapping query_flower_desc() { return flower_desc; } 

    2) Define the mapping flower_desc; in flower_base.c without initialising
       the mapping and the following define.
       #define FLOWER_DESC "/d/Avenir/common/bazaar/Obj/flower/flower_desc"
    3) In the function create_flower() in the flower objects, add the following
       lines first in the function:

       setuid();
       seteuid(getuid());
       flower_desc = FLOWER_DESC->query_flower_desc();
