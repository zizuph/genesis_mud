The Necronisi of Sybarus: Isle of the Dead.
   /d/Avenir/common/dead/*
Iylian (Cirion) made the surface areas of the Necronisi in 1995, and the 
Catacombs languished for 26 years for lack of ideas/interest. I've never 
been particularly excited about catacombs and undead, so I let it lie,
but more and more, the Undead Army on the Isle of the Dead, and Mascarvin 
the Goddess of Death and Rebirth, have become an important part of the Lore 
of Sybarus. And so it is that after returning from a long hiatus, I 
committed to completing the implementation of this major area.

There are 3 ways in to the Catacombs and 4 ways out. 
In: 1-From the cairn where the banshee is--pray to the guardian of the hour 
  and the banshee will drop you in a random spot in the catacombs. Or you
  can piss her off and she will drop you in the pit of despair.
    2-Through the gate/gatekeeper.
	3-Through the BOGL barrow encampment. 
Out:1-Through the gate/gatekeeper.
    2-Up the chute to the BOGL barrow
	3-Through 5 pools located in the Catacombs.
	4-Sair Walls mostly open into other crypt rooms but there is a 30%
	  chance of getting out of the catacombs by using one.
      	
AREAS
Added: ~150 rooms in the /dead/catacombs/* dir, filled with revenants,
  rats, spiders, and other insects.
Added: ~20 rooms to the /dead/barrow/* dir, which is where the goblins
  who live and work in the catacombs live (BOGL).
Added: ~20 rooms in the /dead/mascarvin/* dir for the Meet Mascarvin Quest.
Base room files:
     /d/Avenir/common/dead/barrow_base.c
     /d/Avenir/common/dead/crypt_base.c
Cloning of npcs and objects to the areas are controlled by these files:
     /d/Avenir/common/dead/catacombs/crypt_placer.c
	 /d/Avenir/common/dead/barrow/barrow_placer.c
Updated: the /d/Avenir/common/dead/dead.h file with defs for relative paths
  and props for quests, etc.  
Updated: the cairn.c room in the dead/hill/* dir. Added functionality to this
  room such that interacting with the monoliths (Guardians of the Hours) 
  there, players can be dropped randomly into the catacombs in order to
  solve the quests there (4) and gain ingress and egress through the 
  Gate on the NE side of the island.
Updated: the marsh70.c room in the dead/marsh/* dir. This is the hidden 
access point to the barrow area for the BOGL goblins.

New NPCS: 
Banshee                 /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/banshee.c
   This npc was made by Ilyian but had no purpose so I gave her one. She is 
   the first indication to players that there is more to the Necronisi. Those
   with quickness > 25 can interact with her, ask questions, etc. She has a
   quest (Banshee Mask) and gives hints about other quests in the Catacombs.
   If you are rude to her or you abuse the Guardians she will attack and then
   drop you into the deepest part of the catacombs--the pit of despair.
   She can be attacked but is not meant to be killed. She has no loot.
Bogl                    /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/bogl.c 
  Players have met a few other the Brotherhood of Goblin Laborers in other
  parts of Sybarus but this is the first chance to see them as they live.
  These npcs have low stats and little in the way of loot. They have 
  randomized descriptions and are cloned to the barrow rooms.
Bogl Cook               /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/bogl_cook.c
  The cook for the BOGL camp. She sells seafood dishes under the premise that
  Hizarbin showed the goblins of Sybarus that be eating seafood they could
  improve their temperment and their body odor. Sybarite goblins are more
  socially acceptable than most goblins. 
Bogl Workers            /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/bogl_on_duty
  These are the goblins at work, collecting the corpses dropped off by
  Horowitz the ferry goblin and dropping them down a chute in the barrow
  to be collected and interred in the catacombs.
Bogl Smith              /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/bogl_smith
  The blacksmith for the BOGL camp.  He sharpens and waxes weapons.
Bogl Wise Woman         /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/bogl_wisewoman
  The herbalist for the camp.
Chatelaine              /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/chatelaine.c
  The gatekeeper for the Catacombs. She has a small quest reward for    
  finding her. If you go through the proper channel (Banshee/Guardians) to
  get to her and give her a sybarun coin, she will allow permanent access
  to the Catacombs via the gate.  Unkillable.
Cthulujr                /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/cthulujr
  This is a nod to the original Lovecraftian theme of the Necronisi. The
  creature is an "eldritch abomination" with a stat av of 220. It has stat
  based attacks, poisonous bite, and pushes players out of the room. It 
  lives inone of the pools in the catacombs. It has some alexandrite gems 
  for loot. Waiting for AoB ok for the eldritch_cloak.
Hegemon's Ghost          /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/hegemon_ghost
  This is the ghost of a Hegemon who is documented in the Sybarus Lore.
  He is a quest npc. His scepter was stolen from his sarcophagus and when it
  is returned tlm, he gives hints for access to the area for the Meet
  Mascarvin Quest.  Unkillable.
Hellbender              /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/hellbender.c
   This is a white salamander with some fire resistance living in the 
   Catacombs. It can be picked up.  I tried making it so it will give 
   a bit of fire resistance (5) if you have one, but I don't think it 
   works. It will make an interesting "pet" if nothing else. It is present
   where there are pools of water that are enterable and lead to the sea of
   Sybarus/surface. 
Revenant                /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/revenant
  Populates the catacombs with undead. This file has 3 different settings, 
  cloning npcs on a distribution of sizes from stat av 100 to 160 +random25. 
  The native armor and the unarmed attacks scale up based on the size of the 
  npcs. There's no weapons or armours of special note. Loot is 2 silver or gold
  coins, depending on the size of the mob.  
  Special attack (bite) has a low chance of cloning a simple poison.
Revenant Myth            /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/revenant_m
  Populates the catacombs with mythic undead (7 clones). Stat av 190+random35.
  The native armor is 60-80 and the combat skills are 100. The unarmed combat
  is 100 + 50 skill_extra. Special attack scales up based on the size of the 
  npcs. There's no weapons or armours of special note. Loot is 2 plats, one
  coin for each eye. Special attack has a 1 in 7 chance of cloning a simple 
  poison.
Skeleton                /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/skeleton 
  When using exits, people can randomly knock over bones that form into 
  skeletons that randomly block players from using that exit. The block
  can be broken by trying to use the exit a time or two, so this isn't a 
  death-trap. Loot is two silver coins (that were over eyes) and a random ring.
Mascarvin              /d/Avenir/common/dead/mascarvin/mascarvin.c
  This is the Goddess of Death and Rebirth herself. She cannot be killed, but
  a player who gets overly familiar or insulting toward her will be 
  poisoned and dropped in the pit of despair to die. A player who steals from 
  her table will be robbed, poisoned and paralyzed, and dropped in the pit of 
  despair to die. 
  
There is a boss npc (Spectral Guardian) and its gear that are still being
worked on and will be submitted for review at a later time.
 
New OBJECTS of note:
Death Mask             /d/Avenir/common/dead/obj/death_mask
  This is a non-magical item, a funeral mask placed over the faces of the High
  Lords and Ladies of Sybarus when they die, made of precious metals and gems.
  When worn this mask adds a prop to players that allows them to walk on to the
  ferry to the Necronisi (so they don't have to ride in coffins) and get into
  the catacombs via the gate even if they haven't done the Chatelaine's quest.
Kesoit Death Mask       /d/Avenir/common/dead/obj/kesoit_mask
  This is a magical death mask specifically for the Hegemons. It is intended  
  to "sustain" the spirit of the Hegemon and speed his "rebirth". As such this
  mask grants the following to those who wear it: MAGIC_I_RES_DEATH 30,
  LIVE_M_NO_SCRY, and it blocks the wearer from feeling "hunger" until it
  is removed, at which time the player feels the impacts of not eating again.
    see also /d/Avenir/common/dead/mon/kesoit_mask_sh.c
Eldritch Cloak          /d/Avenir/common/dead/obj/eldritch_cloak.c
  This cloak is the skin of the eldritch abomination, cut from its corpse.
  It is magical, having high AC. It is heavy and voluminous, gives some
  magic res and some acrobat, and makes players panicky. Requires DIS to
  wear it.  
Fire Rose               /d/Avenir/common/dead/obj/rose_fire.c
  This magical rose is cloned (along with other flowers) to a vase on a table 
  in Mascarvin's room. This is a player's one and only chance to get one and I
  wouldn't be surprised if most of them miss grabbing it entirely. I created
  this rose 25 years ago and never implemented it. What makes this rose special 
  is that the 5 petals can be pulled off and tossed toward an exit to block it
  with fire for 15-30 seconds. The tosser and those with high illusion can walk 
  through.  It cannot be dropped or given away. It checks for global disable
  of block.
  see also /d/Avenir/common/dead/obj/rose_petal and rose_flames
Mascarvin's Table       /d/Avenir/common/dead/obj/table_goddess.c
  This is a table laden with goodies. It is a honeypot. If players try to 
  take from it w/o invitation, they get a scary smackdown from Mascarvin and
  they screw up their quest exp reward (stealing is blasphemy in Sybarus). If
  they wait until she offers, they can take what they want. This is the only
  time they will ever get access to this table.  
  Items cloned to it will include the fire rose, the kesoit mask, and the 
  naiad's necklace, as well as foods, gems, and sybarus coins.
  
QUESTS:
Catacombs Gate Quest:  QEXP: 3500
     Give the Chatelaine a token of the God's Grace to Open The Way.
   Sounds simple enough. But. Player is dropped randomly into an area with 150 
   rooms, with dozens of mobs that can be agressive and can block progress. So 
   you've got to talk to the Banshee who will attack you if you ask her too many
   annoying questions, then fight your way through the catacombs to the exit 
   (unmarked), then talk to the Chatelaine to figure out what she wants in order 
   to let you pass.
			  
Banshee's Mask: QEXP: 7000
   Bring the Banshee the death mask of her Beloved.
   You've got to find the right death mask (1 in 16 possible varations) cloned 
   in just 7 of 150 rooms with hostile mobs and then find your way out of the 
   catacombs with it. Will probably take multiple ventures into the crypts
   to find one.
   
Hegemon's Ghost Quest: QEXP 3400
   Someone stole the Hegemon's scepter and awakened him from his rest. Kill the
   thief and bring back the pieces of the scepter to him. 

Meet Mascarvin Quest:  QEXP 20000
   Once you've helped the Hegemon Ghost, he provides hints to help players 
   start this quest. They've got to find the entrance, solve a puzzle to open
   a door, find the way into a maze and solve the maze (keeping track of the 
   names on the threshold along the way or go back and do the maze over again), 
   then polish the crystalline skulls with these names in the right order to 
   unlock the door to meet Mascarvin.
   The puzzles are unique and reset, and only one player at a time can be
   in the puzzle rooms.
   Once player arrives, Mascarvin must leave to gather a dying Sybarite, 
   leaving them in the room with a table full of goodies. If player steals, 
   she gives less experience, takes everything away from them, and leaves them
   with a poison in the pit of despair. Those players who minded their manners
   are rewarded with full qexp and access to the goodies on her table. 
   A major quest with two unique puzzles, a 12 room maze, plus risk of losing
   all their inventory and/or dying. There is no combat in the quest area itself 
   but player will have to fight their way through the catacombs to get to it. 
   This quest will be a significant investment of time. I have made it so players 
   can solve it in stages and not lose their "place".
