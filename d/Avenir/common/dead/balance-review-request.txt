
Balance Review Request Submission
---------------------------------
Request Date: 3 Sept 2021
1. Expanded Isle of the Dead ~200 rooms
2. /d/Avenir/common/dead/barrow/*
   /d/Avenir/common/dead/catacombs/*
   Documentation: /d/Avenir/common/dead/2021Necronisi_overview.txt
3. Players have been visiting the Necronisi for 25 years and this 
   expansion will get them past that gate they've been looking at 
   all this time! 
4. The Necronisi and the Catacombs have been a part of the lore of 
   Sybarus for decades, and this opens up a large area with 4 quests,
   lots of revenants and skeletons to challenge them, and some interesting
   prizes.
5. Downsides? Mobs are a range of sizes and abilities. Some of them block
   exits (easily breakable) and some randomly attack. Getting through them
   to complete the quests is going to be challenging for most players.
6. Testing? All rooms load and have been walked through. Npcs with asks
   have been tested, quests and alternate solutions have been tested. 
   The magical rose and the magical death mask have been tested to make
   sure they work properly. I have asked Zizuph to look at the rose to
   see if he notices any problems with it.
7. Other Comments: I used Tapakah's guidelines for qexp calculations and
   rounded down or did not do all the exp modifiers. 3 of the quests are
   ~3500 qexp and the main one, Meet Mascarvin, is pegged at 18,000. It
   could/should probably be more but I'll leave it to you to determine.

   Also, the boss for the Catacombs (Spectral Guardian) will be submitted
   separately -- I've asked for Zizuph's help on a few things and I didn't
   want to hold up inititating the Balance Review process for the Catacombs
   any longer. 
   
   Area Maps have been uploaded and are working.
   
   I'll get the quest docs polished up once the quests are approved,
   and the quests added to the orb once I get the all-clear.
