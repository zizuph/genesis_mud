LOG OF MEET MASCARVIN quest ending.
Wizinfo /d/Avenir/common/dead/mascarvin/resting
Warmth pervades this amorphous space. Close and red-dark, it pulses and thrums
with numinous energy. The air is heavy with an earthy, feminine scent that
calls up visceral pre-memories of maternal nurturing. The milky mist above
swirls and flows into the shape of a grinning skull that seems to be looking
down upon you. Anguished cries and contented murmurs echo in a faint chorus,
whilst a roiling mass presses upon your consciousness -- the presence of those
recently dead and those long forgotten. You have a sense of the multitudes that
once lived in the penumbra of the Source, dedicated to the Gods, and gathered
to the bosom of Mascarvin for nurturing, awaiting the possibility of rebirth.
   There is a dais in the room, and on it, a throne of skulls with a table
placed nearby. Opposite it is a very large torus, spinning on its edge. 
> 
A feeling of awe presses down upon you.
You feel a divine presence filling the room.
Mascarvin steps forth from the mist.
Mascarvin introduces herself as:
Mascarvin the Goddess of Death and Rebirth, myth, female goddess.
Mascarvin speaks: I see you, Lilith.
Mascarvin speaks: I have followed your deeds. I was prepared to harvest your
soul, but it proved unnecessary.
Mascarvin speaks: You have made it to a place few who expect to live ever do.
Mascarvin speaks: So, I have decided to let you live.
> exa mascarvin
Mascarvin is a hauntingly-beautiful goddess, presenting herself as:
Mascarvin the Goddess of Death and Rebirth, myth enfleshed, female God of
Sybarus.
It doesn't take much mental effort to recognize that you are in the presence of
a goddess. You are looking at She who collects the souls of dying Sybarites and
nurtures them back to the point where they are ready to be reborn and serve the
Gods once more.
Shadows play about this towering, womanly figure dressed in a long, voluminous
cloak the color of blood.
She is wearing a simple black webcloth tunic with a central slit through which
the valley beween her four breasts can be glimpsed.
She is wearing a pair of glittering sandals, a chain of fire agates about her
hips, a black diamond and platinum ring, a fire agate studded armband, a
platinum and cobalt ear cuff, and a black diamond and sapphire diadem on her
forehead.
She wears her black hair in very short, tight curls that lay close to her
skull.
Her skin is pale blue with a pearly sheen.
Her dark eyes are simultaneously compassionate and impersonal.
You feel nourished and revived just being in her presence.
You get the feeling that you should be on your best behaviour around her.
She looks like the image of perfection.
She seems to be feeling very well.
> A deep tone fills the room, low and mournful. The portal stops its spinning.
Mascarvin turns toward the portal.
Mascarvin speaks: I have a soul to collect. Await my return, don't touch
anything, and your patience shall be rewarded.
Mascarvin steps into the flame-limned portal.
The portal starts spinning again.

   There is a dais in the room, and on it, a throne of skulls with a table
placed nearby. Opposite it is a very large torus, spinning on its edge. 
> exa table
A large table, smooth and sleek with layers of lacquer. It is made of the wood
of the kesoit tree, dark reddish-black with a fine red-gold grain. It is
crafted with such precision you wonder if it isn't made from a single block of
wood. Four sybarun coins, eleven kahve truffles, six chocolate-dipped
strawberries, 18 honey drops, three ivory torches, a tiny jar of ebon pomade,
13 black diamonds, a long coral necklace, a kesoit death mask and a crystalline
skull filled with flowers are on the lacquered kesoit table.
> exa torus
This is a torus that seems to rotate on itself along the inside even as it is
spinning on its outer edge. It seems to be made of a dark metal and a reddish
stone of some kind, perhaps jasper or carnelian. In the center of the toroid
various images of other places flash into view in rapid succession. Perhaps
this a portal?
> exa throne
This is the seat of Mascarvin, a throne made of bones. Resting atop a dais of
three concentric rings of skulls, nearly twice as wide as it is deep, it is
covered in a variety of cushions upon which the goddess lounges. The skulls
have jewels for eyes, and the domes gleam with a pearly white lustre. Spectral
figures flicker in and out of view, some kneeling, some standing protectively,
others laying prone in supplication before the throne.
Artfully made, this throne is as beautiful as it is macabre.
> 
The portal stops spinning and Mascarvin steps into the room.
Mascarvin cradles a body in her arms and sits on the throne of skulls. Pressing
their head to her chest, she looks down at you.
Mascarvin speaks: Once again, you see something few who expect to live ever
see.
Mascarvin speaks: This I do out of love for the people of Sybarus, a reward for
their service. I collect their souls and give them peace and nourishment so
they may be reborn to serve again.
Mascarvin speaks: In this way do the Gods of Sybarus honor those who follow the
Pact.
Mascarvin intones: This is our way.
Mascarvin speaks: Do your gods care for you so well, I wonder?
Mascarvin speaks: Speaking of rewards, allow me to reward your patience with
the earlier interruption.
You feel quite a bit more experienced!
Mascarvin gestures toward a lacquered kesoit table.
Mascarvin gets a kahve truffle from the lacquered kesoit table.
Mascarvin speaks: Please, help yourself to whatever you would like.
Mascarvin eats a kahve truffle.
> get truffle from table
You get a kahve truffle from the lacquered kesoit table.
> thank mascarvin
You thank Mascarvin gratefully.
> 
Mascarvin smiles approvingly.
Mascarvin speaks: You have excellent manners.
Mascarvin speaks: How refreshing.
Mascarvin gives you some sybarun coins as a token of Her approval.
> Mascarvin speaks: Sadly, our time has come to an end.
Mascarvin speaks: My work as the goddess of death is never done.
Mascarvin speaks: This is your last opportunity to take what you would like
from my table.
get all from table
You get seven sybarun coins, nine lemon cream truffles, ten chocolate-dipped
strawberries, eleven butterscotch buttons, two ivory torches, a tiny jar of
rose pomade, a dozen black diamonds, a long coral necklace, a kesoit death mask
and a crystalline skull filled with flowers from the lacquered kesoit table.
Mascarvin speaks: I will turn you over to the Chatelaine's good care. She will
see you out of the catacombs, if you so desire.
Mascarvin turns to look at the body in her arms and shifts it tenderly.
Mascarvin speaks: May it be many yera til we meet again.
/d/Avenir/common/dead/catacombs/crypt_entr
This is the entrance to the Catacombs of Sybarus. A long tunnel slants south
down into a frightful blackness. The walls seem to be made from glistening
limestone, and the floor is covered with a thick white mist, similar to the fog
that lies on the moors, but whiter. Some light filters in from the north.
There is an imposing iron gate to the north.
There are two obvious exits: north and south.
Chatelaine.
