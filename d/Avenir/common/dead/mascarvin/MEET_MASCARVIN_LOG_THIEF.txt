LOG OF MEET MASCARVIN quest ending when someone steals from her table.
Wizinfo /d/Avenir/common/dead/mascarvin/resting
Warmth pervades this amorphous space. Close and red-dark, it pulses and thrums
with numinous energy. The air is heavy with an earthy, feminine scent that
calls up visceral pre-memories of maternal nurturing. The milky mist above
swirls and flows into the shape of a grinning skull that seems to be looking
down upon you. Anguished cries and contented murmurs echo in a faint chorus,
whilst a roiling mass presses upon your consciousness -- the presence of those
recently dead and those long forgotten. You have a sense of the multitudes that
once lived in the penumbra of the Source, dedicated to the Gods, and gathered
to the bosom of Mascarvin for nurturing, awaiting the possibility of rebirth.
   There is a dais in the room, and on it, a throne of skulls with a table
placed nearby. Opposite it is a very large torus, spinning on its edge. 
> 
A feeling of awe presses down upon you.
You feel a divine presence filling the room.
Mascarvin steps forth from the mist.
Mascarvin introduces herself as:
Mascarvin the Goddess of Death and Rebirth, myth, female goddess.
Mascarvin speaks: I see you, Lilith.
Mascarvin speaks: I have followed your deeds. I was prepared to harvest your
soul, but it proved unnecessary.
Mascarvin speaks: You have made it to a place few who expect to live ever do.
Mascarvin speaks: So, I have decided to let you live.
A deep tone fills the room, low and mournful. The portal stops its spinning.
Mascarvin turns toward the portal.
Mascarvin speaks: I have a soul to collect. Await my return, don't touch
anything, and your patience shall be rewarded.
Mascarvin steps into the flame-limned portal.
The portal starts spinning again.

exa table
A large table, smooth and sleek with layers of lacquer. It is made of the wood
of the kesoit tree, dark reddish-black with a fine red-gold grain. It is
crafted with such precision you wonder if it isn't made from a single block of
wood. Four sybarun coins, ten raspberry cream truffles, six chocolate-dipped
strawberries, eleven lemon drops, five ivory torches, a tiny jar of azure
pomade, 16 black diamonds, a long coral necklace, a kesoit death mask and a
crystalline skull filled with flowers are on the lacquered kesoit table.
> get all from table
A deathly-cold spectral hand grips you from behind, freezing you in place.
The voice of Mascarvin reverberates in your mind: You will regret trying to
steal from me!
> 
Mascarvin stands regally before you, an expression of disbelief and outrage
on her face.

You have been poisoned!

swirls and flows into the shape of a grinning skull that seems to be looking

those recently dead and those long forgotten. You have a sense of the

There is one non-obvious exit: pit.
Mascarvin.
Mascarvin walks around you, looking you up and do
wn.
Mascarvin scowls menacingly at you.
Mascarvin speaks: Who tries to steal from the Goddess of Death? What were you
thinking to try such a thing?
Mascarvin tilts her head as if listening to your thoughts.

Mascarvin speaks: Here In Sybarus, stealing is one of just a few crimes that
warrants death. It is blasphemy, do you hear?

You feel more tired.
Weakness and pain throb through you.
Mascarvin speaks: In stealing from another being you commit blasphemy. It is
tantamount to saying you believe the gods have not provided properly for you!
Mascarvin speaks: We gods of Sybarus provide for your kind as you deserve. As.
You. Deserve!
Mascarvin speaks: If you want more, then Serve Us Better!

Mascarvin shakes her head while looking at you with an expression of infinite
sadness on her face.
Mascarvin speaks: And you -- you tried to steal from me, from a god...
Mascarvin speaks: You really are a simpleton, aren't you?
Mascarvin looks as though something has just occurred to her, and it doesn't
bode well for you.
Mascarvin speaks: Or...are you a tool of that ugly toad Nitikas?

You feel more tired.
You feel as though you are slowly turning into a block of ice.
Mascarvin speaks: That cesspool scum of a god stole my granddaughter Tjana and
her mother is still sick with grief centuries later.

Mascarvin speaks: You do not want to know what I do to his followers when they
cry out on their deathbeds. I have no succor nor peace for those who serve the
god of greed...

You feel more tired.
You suddenly feel very dizzy.
Mascarvin speaks: There you are, frozen in the grip of death, unable to speak,
unable to move...
Mascarvin speaks: Unable to beseech your gods for aid in this, your hour of
need...
Mascarvin speaks: Are you frightened yet?
Mascarvin laughs with genuine mirth. The sound of her laughter bounces around
the room.

You feel more tired.
A wave of numbness flows through you.
Mascarvin speaks: I could kill you, you know. Steal your mind and leave your
soul roaming the catacombs in decaying flesh for eternity.
Mascarvin speaks: But that isn't very creative.
Mascarvin speaks: I want to do something FUN with you...

Mascarvin speaks: I could give you to the pahloor. They love to play with their
food...
Mascarvin claps her hands delightedly.
You feel more tired.
It feels like your insides are going to come up out of your mouth at any
moment.

Mascarvin suddenly looks excited and happy.
Mascarvin speaks: Oh! I have a better idea!
Mascarvin claps briefly.

There is nothing you can do but ponder what the goddess of death will do to you
next.

Mascarvin moves a hand in a twisting motion

You suddenly find yourself dangling upside-down!

You feel more tired.
A wave of numbness flows through you.
Mascarvin shakes her hand in the air, and you feel yourself flung about wildly,
with your worldly possessions falling to the floor beneath your head.
vitas
There is nothing you can do but ponder what the goddess of death will do to you

Since you are a wizard this paralyze won't affect you.

You roll about in the air like a doll in the hand of a child.

You've been shaken so violently you're starting to feel sick.
You feel more tired.
A wave of numbness flows through you.
Mascarvin speaks: There! Excellent. A fate worse than death is in store for
you.

Mascarvin speaks: All that you had is now forfeit.

You feel more tired.
It feels like your insides are going to come up out of your mouth at any
moment.
Mascarvin speaks: Perhaps going forward you will remember not to take what is
not freely given...and perhaps remember your manners should you find yourself
in the presence of a god again.
You drop three kesoit death masks, a crystalline skull filled with flowers,
three long coral necklaces, a tiny jar of rose pomade, many ivory torches,
eleven butterscotch buttons, nine lemon cream truffles, a kahve truffle, an
arcane gold signet ring, an once-white cowl, an once-white robe, three lumps of

blood-red lily, 648 platinum coins, 49 black diamonds, a red spinel, 244 gold
coins, many sybarun coins and 30 silver coins.

Mascarvin speaks: I put you on notice, you fool. If you see me again it will
mean your death, and the loss of everything you hold dear once again.

Mascarvin speaks: Go, and live all the rest of your days in fear.

Mascarvin strokes the side of you face tenderly with a very sharp fingernail.
Mascarvin speaks: For I am death, and death cannot be robbed nor cheated...


You feel more tired.
You suddenly feel very dizzy.
You feel more experienced!
/d/Avenir/common/dead/catacombs/pit_falling
Darkness presses upon you from all directions. The scent of moist earth fills
fills your nose and you feel like you are falling.
You finally land with a painful thud on a lumpy, slimy, sticky floor. OUCH!
 An oppressive feeling of terror floods your being.
You feel more tired.
A wave of numbness flows through you.

The darkness here is thick and oppressive. The stench is so bad you can feel it
clinging to your skin. Some bones crunch under your feet. Dread and despair
weigh heavily upon your spirit.

You feel more tired.
A wave of numbness flows through you.
The icy grip around you relents.
Feeling returns, and with it, intense pain.
The icy grip upon you fades away to nothingness.
You feel much better.
The icy grip around you relents.
Feeling returns, and with it, intense pain.
