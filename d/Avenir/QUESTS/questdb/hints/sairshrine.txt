The orb before you blinks. 
How bizarre!
You blink back. 
A giant eye much like a fire opal is staring at you.

Thick mists roll toward you and you can hear a loud roaring noise -- the sound of a massive waterfall. 
Nearby you notice a wall, a wall like any other wall, but there is something chiseled into the stone. 
...A familiar shape...
You feel yourself pulled through the wall to stand before a niche with a large column -- and the goddess waiting for you there.

The mists close in and the vision fades as they withdraw.
