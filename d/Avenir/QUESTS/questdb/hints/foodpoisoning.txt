You are unable to see anything in the darkness that overcomes you. A gyrating pain begins to overcome you from deep within your bowels. You double over and out comes everything you've eaten, including rotten rat meat. Perhaps in your misery you are hallucinating, because you feel yourself swept away to the lavatories in Gelan, where some relief might be found. As quickly as it began, the pain subsides and you find yourself back where you were.
