Mist, more mist. Always the mist with Sybarus.... 

You feel yourself deposited on the Necronisi, Isle of the Dead.
Dead center, next to that banshee whose screams echo across the marshes.
She wants something from the catacombs, if you're brave enough and strong enough to fight your way through the army of undead that wanders there.
She'll talk to you about it after you've made it past the catacomb gates, and not before.

Mist closes around you. Mist, more mist. Always the mist with Sybarus....
