A mist comes roiling out of the wall of the Tower and you close your eyes before it can completely envelop you. You smell the breeze of salty sea air, and it slowly begins to change until you smell the delicious food from within an Inn.  Since the mist is still around you, you don't dare to open your eyes, but it is not necessary as you suddenly hear a female voice shout, "Damn it all, I lost my hat again!" The mist slowly dissipates and once more you open your eyes.
