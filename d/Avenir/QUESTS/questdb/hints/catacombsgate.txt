The orb cracks open and a mist floods from it, blinding you. You feel yourself lifted, soaring into shadows.

Your skin is saturated with moisture. You smell the sea, and hear the rush of a massive waterfall.

The mist glows and thins, and you can see that you are soaring through a vast underground cavern, flying east toward a collection of islands.

A goblin hustles far below you, dragging something... dragging a rectangular box that looks like... like a coffin.

He boards a barge and you follow from a distance, flying high above, watching as the barge glides north, toward an eldritch island.

You reach a circle of objects on a hill, and hear a chilling screech that sends fear like shards of ice through you. Down you glide, down to the center of the circle, and there... in the exact center of the circle... is a luminou blur.

The blur moves so fast, speaks so fast, that you cannot understand it.
But somehow... somehow you understand that it is with this figure that your adventure on this island begins.

Visions of endless catacombs flash into your mind. A great and unsual gate. An army of undead. A great and terrible goddess. 

But first, you must figure out how to communicate with the figure on the hill. And then... through her, find a way through the catacombs gate. 

The vision fades, the shadows and mist withdraw, and you realize you never left this place.
