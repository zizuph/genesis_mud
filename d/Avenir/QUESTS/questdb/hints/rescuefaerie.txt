You blink your eyes to adjust to the light that is gradually filling the orb, and when you look again you see yourself standing in the middle of a hidden glade deep within the island the Sybarites call The Holm. 

Suddenly, you realize that you are not alone, and several faeries are flying nervously around you. The scene shifts, and the next thing you see you are facing a horrible looking creature swinging two swords. With it's death cry in your ears you find yourself standing in a fountain, where a shining faerie sits trapped in a cage that cannot be opened without the key, hidden in the watery tunnels beneath. You take a deep breath and dive. Dark water fills your sight, and the scene is gone from the orb.
