In the orb you can see thick mist flowing like a river through the labrynthine catacombs, and the ghost of a hegemon --
A grinning skull suddenly flashes into view. 
Dark eyes stare at you with hostility.
You get the feeling Mascarvin doesn't welcome your snooping around this way.
The orb goes dark.
