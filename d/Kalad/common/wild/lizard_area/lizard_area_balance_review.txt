3. Describe the benefits that players receive by interacting with your
   submission.
   
- This is a new area that modernizes the lizard people area.
- It provides much more of a challenge and hopefully reward
- Quest within area is maintained by adding mimic to mimic_room.c
- Continues to expand on the lore I've developed for Kalad

4. Describe the thematic justification for the benefits that the player
   will receive.

-This area has been widely under accessed and the weapons don't fit
with what players expect today. Modernizing code is good in general
and the area needed to be buffed so it would be something players
would enjoy going to.

5. Describe the downsides that the player will experience that justify
   the balance of the submission.
   
- I don't anticipate any downsides other than possibly dying because
they underestimate the area.

6. How has the submission been tested to ensure that balance is maintained?
   If no testing has been done, how can the AoB team help with this
   testing?

-The area is based on the Thanar Cathedral. While different the 
challenge rating should be similar. I've tested things to ensure
they are working properly. A full junior test by someone who understands
challenge and what modern players may enjoy would be helpful so I will
have Meton do that.
