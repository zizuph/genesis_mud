1. /w/cedivar/fishing/fish

	Figure out why when you clone multiple fish in your inventory the examine
gets weird. If you have a croaker, snapper, hogfish etc and go to examine the
fish you just caught it will instead give a description of the 'first' fish
caught in your inventory.

Also play around with the chances to catch, they seem to be a bit wonky. Getting
the Rare/Uniques way to often for my liking. Add some random chances to get nothing
as well as maybe some gag catches like an old boot or something.

2. /w/cedivar/fishing/rod

	Finish up descriptions and attempt to get the rod casting to work. The 
actions work properly and the item clones with no errors. However getting the
item to clone another other after using the cast action isn't working.

Also, be sure to make it so the rods can only work in the specified rooms.

Add more rods that give a better chance to catch, maybe add in some customization.

3. /w/cedivar/fishing/lure

	Work on lures, will need to see about adding a chance to chage the %
of catch rate but cannot test or even begin until you get the rod working.

Also be sure to add the random lures found under the benches.

4. /w/cedivar/fishing/NPC

	Add in the shop at the shack with the fishing NPC.

5. /w/cedivar/fishing/room

	Make the benches so you have to stand before you can leave the room.
and add lures under them in the trash, randomized. Make it so the rods can
only be used in the specified rooms.

Add in some seagulls maybe, as well as the crabbing, follow what you did for
fishing.

	If you can actually get the system working properly,
