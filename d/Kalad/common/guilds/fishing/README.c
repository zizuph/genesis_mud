This is my apprentice project that is focused around
the concept of crafting, mainly fishing.

The proposal for my project would be to start out by bringing fishing to the
realms. Kabal has plenty of dock space that can be used. Players would buy a
fishing pole from an NPC and choose a location on one of the docks. It will be
automated much like the smithing process is once the command 'cast rod' is
sent. Players can also go crabbing by buying a crap trap instead of a rod and
'set crab trap'.

The difference between the two is fishing you catch one at a time where as
crabbing you can catch up to five at a time.

Creating all the fish, crabs and equipment won't be an issue I am very
comfortable with creating NPCs and items. What I haven't done yet is create a
shop or NPC to sell to/buy from. And I haven't created anything that uses a
randomizer based on percentages, but I am confident that I can figure it out.

Future Plans, Ideas, Thoughts:

Rankings:

Catch of the Week - Person who caught the rarest+biggest fish this arma, Awards
a small monetary prize

Record Holders - Will list all fish and the person who has caught the biggest

Charter Boats for Deep Sea Fishing/Whaling.

Cooking - Introduce a cooking system starting with the fish that provide a
small boost for each meal, much like the weekly special.

Skills - Turn fishing into a skill that provides a 1% catch rate to Rare and
higher for every 10 levels. The skill only rises based on use.

Oysters - Add in Oyster Diving with a chance to get pearls, similar to the
Calia Mermaid Quest. Chance to be attacked by Sharks underwater.

Titles for Record Holders or based on fishing skill.

Add different types of Lures/Customizable Rods and More/Hidden Fishing Locations.
