lp_med.c

- Wouldn't it be nicer to use set_spell_conc_message() rather than
  using this switch() in query_spell_mess() ?

- setup_my_spells() seems rather wasteful.  Is that Spells array
  used elsewhere?  If not, it seems like a waste of memory and
  cpu.

- Why not just reset the long desc when mana is stored rather
  than using a VBFC in the long (query_mana_stored()) ?

terror_sh.c

- Why use LIVE_I_CASTING_TERROR?  Can't you simply set a flag
  in the shadow?  Prop lookups aren't cheap.

- Perhaps put a living() check in not_khiraa().  No sense in
  doing two filters, one for livings and one for members, when
  you can do just one and check for both.

- spell resistance is never negative

- I'm not sure I like the idea of moving npcs back after they
  flee.  If an npc needs to stay in one place, they should
  have NPC_I_NO_RUN_AWAY.

- always use "$command" when using command() on players

- Use OB_NAME() to target someone with command()

ltouch.c

- The stun object should be done as a spell effect object, I
  think.

ghoul_stun.c

- Why add OBJ_I_INVIS to a no_show object?

- The stop_object is going to be the medal, right?  If so,
  where is "my_stop"?
