3. Describe the benefits that players receive by interacting with your
submission.
This submission is an experience area for larger players that
will eventually include a quest to summon Thanar (under development).
I want to open this area as it is complete and will provide the
underlay for the "return of Thanar" to a position of power in
the city.

4. Describe the thematic justification for the benefits that the player
will receive.
I have reworked the thematics of Kalad to bring Thanar into a
position of more repute. They have changed their message and
are looking to "rebrand" so they can gather more followers.

5. Describe the downsides that the player will experience that justify
the balance of the submission.
Difficult combat. Constant switching of targets, spells and
Melee.

6. How has the submission been tested to ensure that balance is maintained?
If no testing has been done, how can the AoB team help with this
testing?
A lot of personal testing with Juniors as well as assistance
from Cedivar and his junior. Cedivar is a good grinder and was
helpful in determining the difficulty of the area.
I am just unsure if the exp/reward is on target for challenge.
