Balance Review Feedback Thanar Temple
-------------------------------------
Arman Kharas, 23 July 2019


IN GENERAL:
Overall some really nice features with how the npcs are coded.
They are quite intelligent and will offer more of a challenge for 
players than some other areas.

Approved from a balance point of view to open.

NPCS IN GENERAL:

When looking at the npcs in the temple, there are a few things that 
need to be considered from a balance perspective that were picked up
by one of Cotillion's exp tools.

                              (  #): Avg  Loot     XP      Score   XP Error
~new_thanar/npc/mpriest       ( 68): 199  66.91gc  63673   35328   80%
~new_thanar/npc/caster_priest ( 69): 193  66.62gc  61676   34595   78%

Looking at the data, we have a very high concentration of npcs (around 140) 
with high experience values (greater than Ghastly Keep), with very high
total loot values. Clearing this area could - if all the gear was sold for
its value - generate around 780 platinum.

I don't think this would be a likely outcome, as none of the loot has a
coin value. So there would be quite a bit of effort for players in getting
a coin reward through selling armour and weapons. So am ok with the 
current equipment mix for the npcs.

The XP Error is largely driven by the high stat average and defence/parry
of 70. All in all I think that is ok, mindful of the special attacks or
spells that aren't taken into account. So I think they are reasonably 
balanced stat and skillwise.

My only concern is the number of npcs in this area. I am ok to leave it
as is for the time being, but if we find that this area is too much of
an xp farm then i think we may need to reduce the number of npcs by
about 20%.


Just want to flag I have only reviewed:
Caster Priest - /d/Kalad/common/guilds/new_thanar/npc/caster_priest.c
Melee Priest - /d/Kalad/common/guilds/new_thanar/npc/mpriest.c
Priest Standard File - /d/Kalad/common/guilds/new_thanar/npc/std_priest.c

If there are other npcs you plan on opening with (there seem to be a few
in the npc directory), i'd need to review those too.

SPELLS:
The spells are look fine to me. There was one issue that I fixed globally:

/d/Kalad/common/guilds/new_thanar/spells/obj/thanar_resist_obj#3665258

When these npcs die when using this spell, the stop concentrating message
goes to the killer.

The pious athletic male priest says: Thanar grant me peace and smite my foe.
The pious athletic male priest attempts to pray through gurgling blood.
You stop concentrating on maintaining tresist.
The pious athletic male priest is no longer surrounded by dark shadows.
The pious athletic male priest died.
You killed the pious athletic male priest.

I've fixed that within /d/Genesis/specials/guilds/souls/spell_manager_soul.c

ROOMS:
Standard Files - /d/Kalad/common/guilds/new_thanar/std
Rooms - /d/Kalad/common/guilds/new_thanar/rooms

Apart from checking the standard files, I didn't have a close look at 
any of the room files beyond having a walk around the area. Was there anything
specifically you feel should be pointed out for particular attention?

ARMOUR:
No issues with the armours.

WEAPONS:
No issue with pclub.c
