General recode plan
-------------------

Fysix@Genesis, 6 Jan 1998, 3 March 1998

rooms:
------

* Change inheritance /d/Kalad/room_std.c -> /d/Kalad/std/room.c
  (Get rid of the funny add_exit calls, you may add some dirt
  objects (/d/Kalad/std/dirt.c) here and there, which are a
  replacement of the dirty exits.)
* Replace the defs.h include by an include of a default.h, specific
  for the area.
* Let the npcs that should be wandering around be cloned by 
  Shiva's clone_handler for random positioning. Let all other npcs
  be cloned by the rooms themselves. So when you edit the room, you'll
  see if there should be an npc there or not.
* Change npc cloning, mostly alarms are used for it now.
  Use the new clone_npcs function for it.
* Check the long descriptions: if the descriptions are shorter than
  4 lines they will have to be fixed.
* Add items to rooms:
  In general I see too little items in the rooms.
  Inside rooms: wall, floor, ceiling
  Outside rooms: ground, sky
* Perhaps make little additions here and there to make the area more
  lively, like a guard patrol which attacks if you'r wacking 
  a citizen.

npcs:
-----

* Change npc arming, alarms are used now, npcs will all use
  /d/Kalad/lib/arm_me.c in the future. (This is standard included
  in /d/Kalad/std/monster.c already).
* Replace the defs.h include by an include of a default.h, specific
  for the npcs of the area.
* Npcs that have a special should use /d/Kalad/lib/special.c
* Let the strong guards assist all citizens using /d/Kalad/lib/assist.c
  The weak guards don't do anything except watch (see background files).
