Summon apparition of thanar:

Command : tsummon
Mana    : 30
Result  : An apparition of thanar (a dumb object with neat description)
          arrives. This apparitions talking are controlled by the summoner
          and can be controlled in this way even if the summoner is not in
          the same room. The apparition can do _nothing_ else, either by
          itself or through the control by the summoner. It will dissapear
          after a short time. (alarm with delay of 60.0)
