-A brief history of the Lieges of Kalad-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Ashbless - Founder and originator of Kalad, he was the first Liege of
            this domain.
-Sandalphon - Successor to Ashbless, he helped keep Kalad alive via
              recruiting of many wizards.
-Antharanos - The third Liege of Kalad. He received the position after
              Sandalphon no longer had time to spare for Kalad. Under
              his leadership, the domain was finally opened. Recently,
              Kalad's first guild, the Thanarian human race guild, was
              opened.
-Korat-       Now retired, semi-active former Liege.
-Rico-      Fourth liege of Kalad, a short term, but like all, could
            not find the time.
-Sarr-      Fifth Liege of Kalad, creater of Raumdor. The God of
            Death, Terror and Madness.
-Mirandus-  Current Liege of Kalad. Kept it alive and adding to it. Reformed
            the Thanar guild and added new content to Kalad. Created the 
            Saurians as an expansion of the Lizard People in Kalad. This 
            Layman/Racial guild was unique and special in Genesis.
* Special thanks go to Mecien and Mercade for helping to keep Kalad alive
  when it needed it the most.
