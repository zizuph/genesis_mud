The Kalad domain has some interesting challenges when creating maps

The largest challenge is duplicate room names.  Every street in Kabal 
starts with s1 and goes up.  An extreme example is the area around the
High-Harvest interstection.  Here we have five rooms called s1 and three 
called s2.

Mapped rooms are separated by the directories to avoid linking issues.

The ascii maps are shared between each of the map files.  When updating
ascii maps, multiple files will need to updated.
