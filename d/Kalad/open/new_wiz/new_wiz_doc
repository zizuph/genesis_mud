***********************
0.	Introduction:
***********************

This file is for wizards of the domain Kalad. If you are new to 
the domain, reading this file should be one of the first things you do.

***************************
0.1	This file:
***************************

This file is rather long, and is full of rules, talk of demotion, and other
unpleasant topics. Nevertheless, in spite of all this is not meant to
intimidate you, but to help you find your way around in Genesis and Kalad.

It was put together drawing on the experience of helping other wizards into the
domain, with valuable contributions from these wizards. You, too, are
invited to comment on this file, to assist us improving it.

If you in the course of the next weeks come to a point where you tell yourself,
'This is stupid, they should have *told* me!', talk to the liege and suggest 
including a corresponding paragraph into this file. (Perhaps you should check
first if it is already included, and if it is, you might prefer not to tell 
the liege that you did not read this file properly. ;-))

***************************
0.2	Asking for help:
***************************

Most wizards, and all wizards in Kalad will help you if you have questions or
problems. It is preferable to ask a Kalad wizard or on the domain line first,
before asking an arch or on the wizline.


***************************
0.3	Rules:
***************************

The domain Kalad abides by all rules in the mud, written or unwritten!
The fact that one or more other domains might or might not do the same is
irrelvant as far as your coding for this domain is concerned. The main aim of
the domain is to produce interesting and balanced code.

There are many rules in Genesis, not all of the are written down. Therefore,
if you have a fantastic novel idea, ask someone more experienced first. You
might not be the first one, and it might be illegal.


***************************
0.4     The domain Kalad:
***************************

The land of Kalad is one where humans dominate, led by their patron
god, Thanar. Here, the demihuman races (elves, dwarves, gnomes, hobbits
and goblins) are rare and are more often known only through tales told
by the fireside. The populace is rampant with moral decay. Supposedly
good citizens allow slave operations in their city, and hold biased
attitudes to those not of their race. Evil, a force so obvious in other
lands, is rooted deep in the heart of many of the people. So much so, 
that evil men believe themselves to be good, when the opposite is true.

We aim towards creating areas where both evil and good players can
play - with a small bias towards the evil ones.

***************************
0.5	Introducing yourself:
***************************

To make yourself known to the other members of the domain, please post an
introductory note on the domain board. You should also post notes there
whenever you finish part of your project, so others can have a look at 
your code, or when you start working on a new project.

You should also add an entry with your name and current project in the file
/d/Kalad/doc/projects. If you need help with this, ask other members
of the domain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***************************
1.      Rules:
***************************

This is a summary of rules which you are required to follow. It is far from
comprehensive, but it should contain the most important ones.


1.1     Where to find them:

- Read the wiz scroll. If you do not have the scroll for some reason, type:
> clone /d/Genesis/obj/init_scroll
> read scroll

- Read the introductory files for wizards. You will find them by typing:
> man INTRO_RULES
> man GENESIS

- Read the rules for wizards in the directory /d/Genesis/doc/rules/wizard,
  especially the file wiz_vs_player_policy.

- Read the COPYRIGHT notice!
> more /doc/COPYRIGHT

- Re-read the rules file for mortals, read it from your now changed perspective!

- Read all the files in /d/Kalad/doc/ since you will find here some specific
  rules for you as a Kalad wizard.

- Read the weapon and armour guides (man weapon_guide, man armour_guide)


***************************
1.2	Opening code to mortals:
***************************

The Lord or the Lady is responsible for every object in the domain. Therefore,
he or she alone has the right to decide which new code is made available to the
mortals in the mud.

This means especially that a quest or an area may only be opened by the Lord or
the Lady of a domain, or by a wizard who has the explicit permission to do so.


***************************
1.3     What you should always keep in mind:
***************************

o  The game is over, you are a wizard!

   Interaction between your wizard character and mortals should be kept to a
   minimum.

   The following actions are illegal and can be punished by demotion:

   - Helping mortals in combat or with quests.

   - Giving hints to mortals, except general info about available commands.
     This means, hints will in most cases be just: 'read help topics'!

   - Restoring anything a mortal lost in a crash. That is for arches and the
     helpers of the player arch to do.

   - Helping a mortal in case of a bug, eg by transfering the player to another
     room, unless the mortal otherwise cannot continue to play. If a room has
     no exits due to a bug, and you know that it is not a trap, you may bring
     the mortal to a room closeby. Resetting a room so a mortal can finish a
     quest might be your last command as a wizard.

   - Giving a mortal any information on his or her character is in almost all
     cases illegal. This includes but is not restricted to telling stat values,
     skill values, fatigue values, weapon and armour classes and so on. It is
     not illegal to tell a mortal, 'If you want to know if that morning star is
     a club, why don't you appraise it?'

   - Your opinion on anything regarding the mud should not be discussed with
     mortals. This includes but is not limited to your opinion on the behaviour
     of mortals, on posts on boards that can be read by mortals, on the balance
     or imbalance of guilds, weapons, domains, and on the positive or negative
     sides of your fellow wizards.

     You should as a rule not post on boards open to mortals outside the domain
     Kalad. You should post on the wizard boards of other domains only if
     there is a valid reason to do so.


***************************
o Seconds:
***************************

   - If you have not finished your apprenticeship yet, as wizard of Kalad,
     you are not allowed to play with a second mortal character.

   - If you have finished your apprenticeship project, you may ask me for
     permission to play a mortal second character. As a rule I will not object
     if you have finished or made good progress on your second project.

   - You have to register your second character using the 'second' command.
     Failure to register your second will lead to the removal of both your
     wizard and your mortal character.

   - If you have a second character, do not interact with your two characters.
     Your second character ideally should not even know the solutions to quests
     your solved with the character that became a wizard! ;-)

   - Giving cash to a npc with your wizard character, and retrieving this later
     with your mortal character can lead to deletion of both characters.
     Reading up quest solutions with your wizard character so your mortal
     character can solve the quests, can lead to demotion.

   - Don't try to outthink me or admin in inventing ways how to help you second
     with your wizard character. If it will be of any help at all to your
     mortal character, chances are (and experience tells me) that it will be
     noticed by someone.

   - It is illegal to tell other mortals that your mortal character is the
     second of a wizard.

   - Your mortal second can NOT be a member of a guild council anywhere in the
     mud. Your mortal second should seek to keep a low profile, and if possible
     avoid direct conflicts with other players.

   - Your mortal second can NOT be a member of a layman or occupational guild
     that is within the domain of Kalad. You are allowed to join any race
     guilds in Kalad though.

   - If the identity of your second as the second of a wizard becomes known to
     mortals by whatever means, your second character will be erased. Since
     it is possible that the identity of your second character is revealed by
     means beyond your control, and mortal second of a wizard always lives
     under the threat of being erased. From personal experience, let me warn
     you to pay attention when you sign notes or letters.


***************************
1.4	Junior characters:
***************************

Junior characters are test characters that you can create to test code with a
mortal character. It is not legal to ask a mortal to test some code for you!

A mortal may come into contact only if the Lord or the Lady of the domain has
opened that code for contact with mortals!

If you have a Jr character, the same restrictions for interaction with mortals
apply as for your wizard character. 

Moreover, it is illegal to socialize with mortals using the Jr character. This
includes introducing the Jr character to other mortals. If you want to be
polite, move your Jr character to another room, and then explain the
circumstances to the mortals concerned using your wizard character.

More details on Jr characters can be found in 'man INTRO_RULES'.


***************************
1.5	Domain specific rules:
***************************


o  No toys!

   Every object in the domain must conform to the rules, including code not yet
   available to mortals. Weapons with WC 100 are illegal, even if they were
   meant just for your personal amusement.

o  Be careful in 'open' areas!

   Do not 'update' an object (including rooms!) in areas open to mortals,
   unless you know exactly what will happen when you do this, and that it will
   not interfere with any mortal.

   This means, that you should never update a room outside the domain Kalad,
   and inside only if you have read and understood the code!

   Use 'Call' extremely cautiously in areas open to mortals.

   Be certain that you know what you are doing, and that it will not interfere
   with mortals.


o  Check domain specific coding conventions and standards in the files in the
   directory /d/Kalad/doc/


***************************
1.6	Other wizards:
***************************

Be polite!

In specific:

o  It is considered to be polite to use the 'audience' command:

   > audience <name>

   to contact another wizard. Just transporting to the wizard with

   > goto <name>

   without asking if you are welcome is considered highly impolite. Look at
   the 'audience' command as knocking on a door before entering.

o  Try to keep questions to as small a group of wizards as appropriate. It
   makes little sense to bother a wizard of Krynn if you cannot find a file
   in Kalad.

   Use 'dtell' (or 'dtell Kalad') before you use 'wiz' if there are wizards
   of Kalad present.

   If someone takes the time to help you, especially if it is a wizard from
   another domain, please show that you appreciate that help.

o  Don't meddle in affairs that do not concern you.

   If you do not like code of another domain, you may - politely! - ask the
   responsible coder or the domain Lord or Lady if they are willing to discuss
   it with you.

   Do not complain on a board about it, especially not if it is a board that
   can be read by mortals.

   If you think the problem is serious, please talk to me first.

   If you discover a bug in another domain, make a bug report or mail the
   responsible coder or Lord/Lady. Do the same if you think an item is in
   violation of the rules. There is no need to involve the arches if a simple
   bug report will notify your colleagues of an oversight.

   In short, 'Don't do unto others what you do not want to be done unto you!'


***************************
1.7	Network security
***************************

A wizard character on a LPmud is a kind of super user.

You have been given this status because we trust you not to abuse this status.
This trust is personal, that means, it has been extended to you, not to anyone
else. We therefore expect you to take all reasonable precautions to prevent
anyone else to abuse the status of your wizard character.

One of these precautions consists of choosing a 'safe' password. If you do
not know what a 'safe' password is, please ask! If in doubt, please ask!

If you password is cracked, and someone else use your character, you will be
held responsible unless you can convince me that you were not negligent in
choosing a password.

Another of these precautions is that you keep your password secret and known
only to yourself. I will consider wizard who give their passwords away to
other persons, even to wizards of the domain Kalad and even to me, as
security risks to the domain and to Genesis.

If you want to keep your status as a wizard, do not give your password away
to anyone!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



***************************
2.	Help files:
***************************

2.1	LPC:

There are two manuals on LPC available, and Mrpr is presently writing a new and
much improved one. I suggest you start with reading this new manual.
As it is still a draft, you can find it in the directory ~mrpr/open/lpc/.

The other manuals are:
/doc/man/general/INTRO
/doc/man/general/LPC

You can access these two files using the command 'man':
> man INTRO
> man LPC

A more extensive documentation of 'value by function calls' can be found in:
/doc/man/general/VBFC_MANUAL.

Type
> man VBFC_MANUAL
to read it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***************************
3.      Important commands:
***************************


***************************
3.1     allcmd:
***************************

'allcmd' gives you a list of all commands available to you. It is a very good
idea to spend a few hours to get familar with your commands.


***************************
3.2     sman:
***************************

'sman' is a very powerful tool for coders.

It enables you to find the function name of almost every function in the mudlib.
An experienced user can answer almost every question concerning the mudlib
using 'sman'.

Do not start coding before you have made yourself acquainted with this tool.
The 'help sman' file is a must!
An experienced user can answer almost every question concerning the mudlib
using 'sman'.

Do not start coding before you have made yourself acquainted with this tool.
The 'help sman' file is a must!

If you have a problem finding the information you want using 'sman', ask
someone more experienced, 'I tried to find <topic> using sman, but for some
reason I didn't manage. Can you please tell me what I did wrong?' instead of
asking on the wizline, 'What's <topic> and how does it work?'

Examples for the use of 'sman' at the end of this file.


***************************
3.3     man:
***************************

'man' is similar to 'sman', but gives info on efuns (external functions, ie
gamedriver funcitons), rules, properties, and more. Try 'man -c' to see the
available chapters.

I already used this command a few times in preceding paragraphs as it allows
quick access to important reference files.

The most important chapter is 'man general' (directory /doc/man/general/).
It contains files with rules on many different topics. You can access these
files using 'man <topic>'.

You are expected to know everything in those files, if it is relevant to your
coding. To learn eg about weapons and armours type:
> man weapon
> man armour
> man weapon_guide
> man armour_guide
and read those files before you start coding your first weapon ad your first
armour!


***************************
3.4     tracer:
***************************

The tracer is another powerful tool. With it you can do get information about
objects in the mud and call functions in the objects.

Reading 'help tracer', 'help Call', and 'help Dump' is absolutely required. If
you have any problems or questions, ask a helpful wizard to explain it to you.


***************************
3.5     ed:
***************************

The one and only editor in the mud. For a manual see 'man general ed'.


***************************
3.6     toolsoul and cmdsoul:
***************************

Souls are used to define commands. You already know souls (or at least what
can be done with them) from the souls defined by guilds. You guild commands
are defined in a soul.

There are also souls for wizards to make coding and managing the game easier.
Souls that only wizards may have are called tool souls, all others are called
command souls.

But a word of wisdom and warning:

In the old days, when I was a young wizard, almost all code for the exclusive
use of wizards (wizard tools) was considered unnecessary and thus illegal. As
it is hard to teach new tricks to old dogs, I still frown on 'wiz code'. We are
here to code for the mortals, not for ourselves!
So think twice (and think better) before you code another skill setter, wiz
line, or whatever.

Once upon a time, wizard toolsouls were illegal unless declared legal by the
by the admin. Legal toolsouls are:

/cmd/std/tracer_tool,
/d/Terel/mortricia/open/kit,
/d/Wiz/mrpr/ka/ka,
/d/Gondor/mercade/open/mgl.

'ka' contains the command 'dtell', a domain tell. This is also highly useful,
especially for the beginner, since it enables you to ask you fellow Mordor
wizards before putting a question onto the wizline.

To load a new tool soul, eg 'ka', type:
> toolsoul /d/Wiz/mrpr/ka/ka
> newhooks

'newhooks' enables the command defined by the toolsoul.

To list your toolsouls, just type
> toolsoul

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



***************************
4.	Boards:
***************************

To keep up to date on developments in the domain and in the mud there are
several boards you should read.

To read boards, use of the mbs wizard soul is recommended. For an introduction
read 'mbh tutorial'.

The boards that are considered obligatory reading for every member of the
domain are (name, category, domain, as used by mbs):
- Admin, Adm, Genesis
- Info, Adm, Genesis
- News, Adm, Genesis
- Gd, Develop, Genesis
- Lpc, Develop, Genesis
- Mudlib, Develop, Genesis
- Tool, Develop, Genesis
- Kalad, Domain, Kalad
- Kalad, Domint, Kalad

Recommended reading are:
- Coop, Adm, Genesis
- Discuss, Adm, Genesis
- Domain, Adm, Genesis
- Guild, Adm, Genesis
- Idea, Adm, Genesis
- Magic, Develop, Genesis

Before you ask questions, you might want to make sure that they are not
answered on any of the boards mentioned above.

The boards for mortals in the domain are:

Board      Category   Domain     Description & Savepath (/d/Kalad/log/..)  
-----      ---------  ------     ----------------------  
Drakmere   Area       Kalad      Drakmere city  /drakmere_board_data
Drow       Area       Kalad      Drow public  /drow_pub
Kabal      Area       Kalad      Kabal city  /kabal_board_data
Undraeth   Area       Kalad      City of Undraeth  /undraeth
Beggars    Club       Kalad      Beggars club  /beggar_board_data
Fang       Guild      Kalad      Red Fang goblins  /red_fang
Shadow     Guild      Kalad      Shadow Walkers  /shadow_walkers_board_data
Thanar     Guild      Kalad      Thanar race guild  /than_pub
Drowp      Guildint   Kalad      Drow private  /drow_priv
Thanarp    Guildint   Kalad      Thanarian private  /than_priv

To add these boards to your mbs-list, use the command

 mbs s <board> <category>

To learn how to use 'mbs', use the help info on 'mbs' supplied via the command
> mbh tutorial
> mbh mbs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***************************
5.	Coding:
***************************

5.1	Examples and how to treat them:

Most domains in Genesis have grown over several years. In this time old wizards
left, new wizards joined, the mudlib and the gamedriver were modified.

Consequently, there is a lot of code out there that works, but is completely
unfit to be used as example if you want to write good code. Therefore, before
you use any code as example, please ask someone knowledgeable if that code is
fit to be used as example!


***************************
5.2	'inherit':
***************************

Proper use of 'inherit' saves CPU time, memory, and disk space.

Before you start coding in Kalad, you will have to have at least a basic
understanding of the concept of inheritance, and how it differs from
the precompiler directive '#include' (and from - horribile dictu - paste
and copy).

Use 'include' only if it is impossible to use 'inherit'.

Copy functions only if it is impossible to use 'include'.

Never copy a file of 100 lines just to modify 3 or 4 of them!

If you have files which differ only in a few lines (eg two neighbouring rooms,
a large and a small orc, ... ) you should consider making one common file, and
then configuring or inheriting this common file. 

If you have more than 3 of those files, you should be prepared to produce an
excellent reason to explain why you didn't create a common file.

'I didn't know how.' will not be an acceptable reason.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***************************
6.	Directories:
***************************

In Kalad we have a structure to the directories:

The following directories are the resposebility of the Liege. Any
additions/changes must be approved by him/her first:

/d/Kalad/       -  contains files that the whole domain uses.

/d/Kalad/doc/   - contains any documents of importance to the wizards
                  of Kalad. Eg. rules, coding information.

The directories beneath are common to us all. Keep them clean!

/d/Kalad/private/ - Contains information that we want hidden for others.
                 QUESTS/ - Contains information on all quests in Kalad.
                           Any new quest must be accompanied with a
                           document here.
                 MAGIC/ - Contains information on all magical objects in
                          Kalad. Any new magical object must be accompanied
                          with a description here.
                 GUILDS/ - Contains detailed information on all guilds
                           in Kalad.

/d/Kalad/open/   Contains any information we want visible to all other wizards.
              BITS - A list of the bits used in Kalad. If you use a bit - you
                     must update this list!
              SHOPS - A list of shops in Kalad. If you make a shop - you must
                      add a description of it here.
              GUILDS - A short note on where one finds the detailed description
                       of guilds in Kalad.
              MAPS - A list of maps in Kalad. When you make an area, you must
                     also make a map of it - to aid the liege in checking it out.
                     The map should be placed in the same directory as where the
                     code is, but maps of the cities is made available to the
                     mortals, so we place those here.

      The other files in this directory is the responsebility of the Liege. If you
      have a document you think ought to be in this directory, ask the liege.

/d/Kalad/std/   Contains different standardization-files we use in Kalad.
                Files based on /std/object.c like room.c, monster.c,
                and creature.c.

/d/Kalad/lib/	Standard inheritable code for Kalad,
                not based on /std/object.c

/d/Kalad/sys/   Kalad header files,
                do not include "/d/Kalad/defs.h" any longer,
                which is kept for backwards compatibility.

/d/Kalad/obj/   Important objects in Kalad, like
                clock.c   Kalad's central clock.
                outlaw.c  A database containing all Kalad's outlaws.

/d/Kalad/common/ In this directory you will find all the areas/code that is
                 or will be open for mortals to walk in. There are several
                 branches in it, and any new branch must be approved by the
                 liege - simply because he/she needs to have control ;)
                 Each of these directories in /common must have a README file
                 in it, explaining what kind of files the directory has - and
                 a description of the area and its history relative to Kalads
                 history. We want some logic in how we structure Kalad.

/d/Kalad/<wizard name>/  These are our private directories. Yours to play with.
                         One rule though ... never place open code in your
                         private directory!

Do no longer use any of these obsolete files:

old file:                     new file:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Kalad/room_std.c      ->   /d/Kalad/std/room.c
/d/Kalad/defs.h          ->   /d/Kalad/sys/*
