   The following are the rules Kalad wizards are expected to abide by,
in addition to the general rules of Genesis.
-You cannot give out quest-related information to any mortal.
-You cannot do any quests within Kalad with any seconds you have.
-All your mortal seconds(not including juniors) must be listed, or else
 I will consider this as cheating.
-You cannot add experience to mortals, assist them in combat, use them
 to test unopened quests, bring them into unopened areas, clone objects
 for them, tell them the location of other mortals, tell them which
 wizards are on, tell them the location of npcs, etc.
-Your mortal seconds(not including juniors) cannot join any guilds in
 Kalad.
