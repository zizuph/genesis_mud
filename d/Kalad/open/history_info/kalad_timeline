-A timeline of the land of Kalad from a Kabalian perspective-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(time indicated in KF {Kabal Founding} )
-80 KF - Birth of the human, Kabal, in the village of Thandyr within the
         realm of Imneria.
-50 KF - Racial unrest in Kalad, the humans band under the leadership
         of a new god, Thanar, and his chosen one, Kabal. Humans
         instigate wars with elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits.
-48 KF - Elves lose the war against the humans, most if all elves now
         considered dead.
-45 KF - Dwarves forced to retreat from the human onslaught, many are
         believed to have gone underground.
-43 KF - Gnomes and hobbits massacred in one great battle led by the
         Avatar of Thanar and the human warrior, Kabal. A combined
         force of elite demihumans manages to slay the avatar. The
         group is slain to the last demihuman by another group led by
         Kabal. Kabal buries the avatar in a secluded location in the
         Hespyre mountains, along with several items of power carried
         by the avatar.
-42 KF to -1 KF - 'Cleansing of Kalad' undertaken by the legions of
                  Thanar. Last surviving settlements of demihumans 
                  either conquered, destroyed or forced underground.
 0 KF - The city of Kabal founded by the man of the same name.
10 KF - Kabal, leader of the Thanarian revolution, dies at the age of 90.
11 KF - A distant cousin of Kabal takes control of the city, crowning
        himself the first king of Kabal. He is the first of the 
        Viskaar line of rulers.
11 KF to 136 KF - The Viskaar line of rulers govern Kabal. In this
                  period Kabal becomes the most important city in all
                  of Kalad, meanwhile extending its influence into the
                  surrounding Hespyre Mountains, founding many towns
                  and villages. This period known as the 'Golden Age'
                  of Kabal.
137 KF - The Viskaar rulership ends abruptly, with the assasination of
         the last heir to the throne, a 6 year old boy.
138 KF - After many months of anarchy, a City Council is formed, from
         which a High Lord is elected to rule the city. After the death
         of the last Viskaar ruler, public worship of Thanar is
         outlawed. Kabal adopts the worship of Solara, the sun
         goddess, declaring it the state religion. Worship of Thanar
         gradually decays into cult worship.
140 KF - The Knights of Thanar and the Holy Order of Thanar founded.
         While worship of Thanar continues to be outlawed in Kabal,
         Thanar worship reaches new heights of grandeur in the 
         centrally-located Empire of Canthyr.
150 KF - Many of the outlying towns and villages revolt under the
         yolk of Kabalian rule. Kabal retaliates by sacking and burning
         virtually all of the villages.
196 KF - Trade relations are broken off with Canthyr, a realm to the
         east of Kabal, past the desert known as the Great Kalad Waste.
206 KF - The Council of Kabal decides to open up the city for trade
         with non-Kaladians. Many non-Kaladians arrive within the city.
         Thanarians become more active, and gain some support from the
         city populace.
207 KF - The Great Dust Storm within the desert waste finally subsides.
         Trade between Kabal and the waste nomads increases, while
         relations with Canthyr continue to decline. Many of the
         foreigners find they have common ground with the 'hidden'
         society of Kabal. The Thanar cause gains momentum.
208 KF - Sporadic raids by fierce dark elves (Drow) occur against the
         city of Kabal. The Thanarians continue to remain an underground
         presence.
