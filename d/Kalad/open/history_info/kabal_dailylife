   Life in Kalad is quite routine. There are no seasons in Kalad and the
sun is always shining. The Kalad (daily) cycle is divided into
four periods. The first three periods, new-watch, midwatch, and latewatch,
last for five hours each. These are the primary hours that the Kaladians
are awake, during which they work, eat, shop, and spend their free time.
The fourth period is called endwatch, during which most Kaladians sleep,
and lasts for nine hours. Though, there is no true boundary between one day
and the next, the Kaladians still operate on a twenty-four hour system, due
to the natural sleep cycle of their bodies.
   In and around the city of Kabal, most businesses will be open during
the first three periods and closed during the last. Of course there are
many exceptions to the rule, the most common being pubs, taverns, and
Inns. For security reasons, due to the reduced staff, the city gates are
closed during endwatch. However, the port remains open at all hours.
