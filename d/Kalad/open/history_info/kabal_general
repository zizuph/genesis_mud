                      KABAL OVERVIEW
__________________________________________________________

   Kabal is the single seaport of Kalad and its major city.
The city is divided into 6 seperate districts. Those districts
are the Caravan District, the Tradesmen's District, the
Central District, the Market District, the Port District,
and the Upper Class District. There are three city gates.
The Caravan Gate in the northeast corner of Kabal, leads
to a mountain pass and beyond to Kalad proper. In the 
north end of Kabal is the Highland Gate, leading to the
private estates of the nobility. The Farmer's Gate leads
west to the pastures and farmlands just outside of the
city.
   The Caravan District, in the northeast corner of
Kabal, gets its name from the many caravans entering and
leaving the city, bringing trade from the rest of Kalad.
Being right inside the gate, this area specializes in
shops and services for travellers and traders. The district
boasts an Inn, a General Store, warehouses, stables, a
Perfumer, a Money Changer, and a Map Maker. There is the
Wayfarer's Guild for adventurers to trade information and
the sinister Trading Company has its headquarters in this
district. A Slave Market for the illicit slave trade is also
located here, not far from either the estates of the
nobility or the gladiatorial arena.
   In the southeast corner of the city, the Tradesmen's
District represents the middle class craftsmen of Kabal.
Here you will find a Wineshop, Bakery, Butcher,
Restaurant, Jeweler, Blacksmith, Armourer, Rope Maker,
Basket Weaver, Tabbaconist, and Tailor.
   Shaped like a triangle, the Central district sits
in the center of the city, snug between the Market,
Upper Class, Tradesmen's, and Caravan Districts.
This is where all of the government offices, and
political groups are located. In the very middle of
the district is the Central Plaza. Here you will find
the reknowned Library of Mathegus, named after the
famous philosopher. Also in Central Plaza is the
Post Office, Fire Brigade, and Council of Lords.
Encircling Central Plaza is Guild Circle. The Merchant's
Guild, representing the middle class of Kabal, and the
Order of Mathegus Sage's Guild are both located here.
There is also a Bank and Employment Office on the circle.
The High Lord's Citadel, shaped like a pyramid, faces
the barracks of the City Militia across the Promenade,
in the northeastern corner of the triangle. In the
northwestern corner is the Royal Gladiatorial Arena,
and the Temple to the Moon Godess Lunara rests in the
southern corner. At the north end, in a triangle between
the Promenade, Gladiator Row, and High Street, is a bell
tower which can be heard from the entire city.
   The Market District borders on the Farmer's Gate, in
the western side of the city. It takes its name from
the giant open-air market in the center of the district,
and this is where the farmers come to sell their goods.
The market is also the home for all manner of peddlers,
food vendors, jugglers, mimes, charletans, and hustlers.
The air is thick with the aroma of exotic foods and the
shouts and cries of merchants hawking their wares. The
streets are crowded though, a prime opportunity for the
many pick pockets, cut-throats, and beggars. The Market
District is also famous for its narrow, twisting network
of interconnecting alleys and streets, rightfully dubbed
Serpent Street.
   A huge cliff at the south end of the city separates the
Port District from the rest of Kabal. Massive Cranes lower
baskets from the city, bringing cargo and passengers back
and forth. A portion of the district is built on the
solid rock at the bottom of the cliff but most sits on
top of wooden boardwalks. The docks are filled with
Merchantmen and tiny fishing vessel alike. Here hardened
Sea-dogs share the streets with silk-clad merchants,
dock hands, soldiers, and world travellers. Not the safest
place for those nor bred for harsh living. Crime is
rampant and wandering press gangs harass all who pass.
In this district you may find a Pub, a Sailmaker,
warehouses, a Gaming House, a Netmaker, a Shipwright,
a Tar Shop, a Tannery, and a Tattoo Parlour. The Trading
Company has their Shipping Office here. This is also the
home of the Hellish Halfling Brewery, loved and hated for their
infamous triple stout, said to make humans as hairy as a halfling.
   The Upper Class District is in the northwestern corner of
Kabal. This is where the nobility have their city villas,
where they stay when in Kabal, though they have much finer
estates in the Highlands northeast of the city. The streets
are kept clean and fairly free of crime. Twilight Park is
located here. Originally created to cushion the Upper Class
District from the sights, sounds, and smells of the city,
the park has become the hangout of criminals and homeless.
Needless to say, the park is not safe at night.
