The Major Powers within the Kaladian Pantheon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THANAR - Patron God of Humanity
   This god is known to nearly every inhabitant of Kalad, as he has
played a pivotal role in the ascension of humanity to its position of
dominance over the demihuman races. It is uncertain why this god has
shown such a preference for humans, but the outcome is an increase in
both his power as well as his worshippers. In times past, Thanar was
the sole deity worshipped by the Kaladian humans. However, as time passed,
his increasingly beligerant faith fell out of favor with the common
masses, who turned to less demanding gods for worship. Now, his name
is more feared than worshipped, save for the isolated enclaves of humans
that still worship him.

SOLARA - The Sun Goddess
   More a pure force of nature than a powerful deity, Solara is 
nevertheless worshipped by large groups of people, for the simple fact
that her symbol, the sun itself, is ever-present in the skies over
Kalad. A practical power, Solara accepts worshippers of all races and
all dispositions, making her one of the most widely worshipped of gods
in Kalad. Solara sees the Thanar religion as extremely destructive and
ultimately fatal to Kalad, and despite being essentially neutral in
alignment, opposes the chaotic influence Thanar seeks over humanity.

RAHXVAN - God of the deep dwarves
   This is a lesser God simply because only a few of the deep
dwarves still remember him. After the great wars that was 
disasterous for the dwarves, the few left turned away from their
old faith. But Rahxvan's power still lingers inside the old
halls and citadels of Underdark, and can blossom 
if the right incentive is there.

THE NAMELESS ONE -
   The ruler of the Netherworld, where the souls of the restless dwell.
Known also as the God of Death, this deity is worshiped by the Khiraa, who
gain their clerical powers from Him. He has many sub-lieutenant dieties
and demons bellow Him.

GOD OF RAUMDOR -
    The object of worship by the good people of Raumdor. Much modeled on
the medival christian church. This deity protects His worshipers from the
evils of the darkness.
