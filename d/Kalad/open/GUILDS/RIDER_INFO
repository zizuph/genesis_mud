|                   THE RIDERS OF THE RED FANG                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|         Long ago, the humans of Kalad atempted to clear this land   |
| of all that was thought to be unpure. An army of Human knights      |
| slaughtered countless demihumans, in the name of thier God, Thanar. |
| The demihumans where driven from Kalad in only a few short months   |
| because they where out numbered, and out mached.                    |
|         After the demihuman races had recollected themselves        |
| outside of the city, they needed form a system of leadership. An    |
| elite band of goblin wariors began to form in the Highspyre         |
| mountians, this was the army of the Red Fang (to read about their   |
| history inquire upstairs).                                          |
|         The Warriors of the Red Fang made themselves known, and     |
| revolted against the Tharanrims. Many battles where fought and much |
| blood spilled on both sides. The Red Fang made a huge impression,   |
| but where still outnumbered and out matched. The Thanar had grown   |
| in power and strength in the time the goblins where createing their |
| army.                                                               |
|         Rumors of the Red Fangs power had spread through Kalad, and |
| many humans feared for thier lives. Other groups of people also     |
| heard these Rumors, these groups where the bands of Dwarves, Elves  |
| and other demi-humans that had gone into hiding after the wars.     |
|         About 5 years ago, a dark-elf came to the Hideout of the Red| 
| Fang. This Drow's name was Dezzin Dar'keth. Dezzin was a freedom    |
| fighter for his people, and leader of a small army that also aposed |
| the Thanarims. Dezzin met with the Fang leader Brutakis in private, |
| and discussed ways they counld help one another. After many talks,  |
| they decided to combine their numbers and go against the Thanarims  |
| in a battle during the next lunar eclipse. This battle was known as |
| the 'dark allaince'.                                                |
|         The battle lasted for days, and the combined efforts of the |
| Red Fang and Dra'keth's men, drove the Thanar back within the gates |
| of Kabal. This was a great victory for the Demihumans, and raised   |
| moral. A few weeks later a dwarf named Gregor, came to the Hideout, |
| and offered his services and his men to the cause. The new combined |
| army, trained thier men in the use of swords, as it was the weapon  |
| most often looted from the Thanar, they also focused on training the|
| Wolves of the Red Fang. Gregor brought great beastly mountian Wolves|
| down from the Highspyre mountians and bred them with the wolves the |
| Fang already possed. the New breed was know as the Warwolf. The army|
| named themselves the Dark Alliance.                                 |
|         The members of the Alliance are highly trained warriors who |
| are bent on takeing thier freedom as demihumans back from the Pagan |
| God of the Thanar. Over the years, the Army has developed this      |
| guildhall anda nasty reputation to the thanarims.                   |
|         It has always been known by the Riders, that this is not    |
| mearly a military organization, this guild is a family. You shall be| 
|expected to live and die for one another. And to punish those that   |
| hurt or offend your brothers and sisters severly. These walls will  |
| become your home, and you feelow guild members, you life and death. |
| Come..commit yourself to the destruction of the Thanar, and the     |
{ humbling of thier kind!                                             }
