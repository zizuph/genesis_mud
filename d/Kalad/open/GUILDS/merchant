Merchants of Kalad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A short review of the guild:

Guildmaster: Korat
Type of guild: Layman
Tax of guild: Still unknown
Requirements to join: A quest - still unmade.

This guild is not typical of genesis since it offers almost no offensive
skills/powers. It is intended to aid the players with both skills and
emotes to act the role of medieval merchants. They will have several
guildhalls - of varying sizes - all over Kalad (and maybe over genesis)
where they can start and train their skills. Their skills will
be of the types: trading, appraise value/object, awareness.

Their emotes will show their love for the trade and the travelling.
Any item is for them mostly a thing they can sell onwards to others
for an as extreme prize as possible.

A special item these merchants will have, is a pack-animal that
will carry any item they want. You may think of it as a big, walking
rucksack. But it is a rucksack that can be killed during their travels.
If the pack-animal dies (a horse if they start out in a city, a camel if they
eg. start out in a beduin camp/desert area) they will have to buy
a new one from one of their houses around Kalad (or genesis).

Other ideas for special abilities:
Hide behind - a skill that abels the merchants to hide their butt from
attackers. They can hide behind their pack-animal or any players they
_lead_ in a team. If they hide, they will be removed from battle (they
will get a add_attack_delay() added I think.). Merchants are not
fighters. They are traders who hire helpers to protect him/her.
and the cargo!

Shopkeeping - They get to control shops in their guildhalls. In these
shops, the merchants may sell and buy items for the prizes they themselves
think is proper. The more they get for an item, compared to the actual
worth of the item, can reflect in a added description of their character.
Also, these shops will allow the sale of magical items. If no merchant
is at the shop when a player comes to purchase, it will work as a normal
shop. A merchant may also give away items from these shops, but this
would be so uncharacteristic of a merchant that it will show clearly
in their character. It will also be reported to the leaders of the guild.

Goodscollecting - This is a more uncertain ability ... A merchant can, if he/she
leads a team, hire helpers to protect the cargo and the merchants life.
With the help of the hired helpers, the merchant can wander around to
"collect" items that he/she can later sell some place. The value of the
"found" goods when sold, will add to the merchants "fame" as a member.
Meaning it will increase the players guildstat. Combat will not increase this
at all.
   The merchant must "hire" helpers (depending on the hired players stats,
the merchant must pay cash at once) and return to "bargain" for the goods.
The merchant may also not be allowed to fight him/herself during this trip.
Not sure about that part though.
The actual value of the goods sold will be told to the helpers (what
the merchant actually gets will not be told), so that they can argue
among themselves how much the helpers should have of the income.
They are paid though in the start ;)



The guilds structure:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most members will have a title of "Merchant" but also a mention of which
house they belong to (where they have decided to start) A merchat who starts
out from none of the houses will just be called "Merchant".
A merchant starting in Kabal will then be "Merchant of the house of Kabal"
Those Merchants who has the highest guild-stat (or maybe the best traders eg.
the one with highest int ? ) will be Master Merchants. If three such
master merchants wishes to, they can expel members they feel does not
act like a true merchant - players that just doesn't trade and bargain at
all (See above for an example).

Penalty to either leave or to be banished is ... a drop of several skills,
randomly taken. I wish the penalty to be monetary ... and to delete their
bank-account just doesn't do it ;)
