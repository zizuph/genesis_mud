-The Drow (dark elf) race guild-

   This guild was created in order to provide players of evil elves the
oppurtunity to further role-play their characters. As drow (dark elves),
the player may begin in an environment more appropriate to his evil
nature. Members of the Drow guild may begin in the Drow guild, which is
located in an underground city by the name of Undraeth. The emotes of 
the guild, along with the titles, reflect the wanton and cruel natures
of the Drow race and their fanatical devotion to their patron goddess,
Lolth the Spider Queen.

   All the guild files are located in /d/Kalad/common/wild/pass/drow/guild/
with the soul being in /drow_soul.c
and the shadow in /drow_shadow.c
and the joinroom in /joinroom.c

This is the tax computation for the guild:

SS_WEP_SWORD 40 (10 above adv. guild), taxed at 1.5% per 60 levels
10/60 = .167
.167 * 1.5% = .251%

'drow sight' (ability to see in the darkness for 30 seconds) at a mana
cost of 75 and only usable if mana of player is > 74, taxed at 2%.

.251% + 2.000% = 2.251% rounded up to 3.000% TOTAL TAX

-The other skills taught at this guild are all at adv. guild levels and
 below:
-SS_LANGUAGE:50

- After March'97 skill revision:
Keeping SS_HIDE at 30
        SS_SNEAK at 30
        SS_TRACKING at 40
Due to drops in skills avaliable in adventuring guilds, there is now
30 levels to be taxed.  30/60 = .5
    0.5% + 2.51% = 3.01%
