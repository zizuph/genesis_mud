Special skill SS_WOLF_RIDING 100, ability to ride wolves around. The 
wolves themselves enabler the guild special.
Members who are also a member of the Red Fang Racial guild are already
taxed for this ability, so they will not be taxed here. However,
non-members will be taxed at an extra 2%.
 
Special skill SS_WOLF_HANDLING 100, the ability to handle your wolf in 
combat, this skill determins how much damage your wolf can do, under 
your control. Weather or not you can jerk his head to the right spot 
to slash for max damage. It is guild specific for the combat special.

GUILD SPECIAL:
"rslash" -wolf slashes at oponent, well it looks that way anyway, it's
relaly the player who executes the attack, but it appears the wolf does.

It can be used once every eight rounds, which is once every 16 seconds.
Damage is dependant on skill of wolf handling, and the rider's discipline
stat. The formula is this: F_PENMOD(MIN(50,random (21)+(dis/4),skill)
Thus, at the most, 50 is the value for the pen. This would only be used if
the player's dis somehow exceeded 200. This the absolute max would be a
pen of 336. Taken at 1/8 rounds = 12.5% of the time. 12.5% * (336/280) =
15%. Since it is skill dependant, we divide it in half to  7.5% combat
aid. At 1% per 6% combat aid, we get: 1.25%
280 is the F_PENMOD(40,100) which is the max value for non-magical
weapons.

The guild offers an pub and store exclusivly for riders - 1%

Total: 1% + 1.25% + 3.32% = 5.57 -> 6% (this is for fang race guild members)
We add an extra 2% for the wolf riding ability(no fatigue taken while on
wolf)
Total for non-fang race guild members 6% + 2% = 8%
