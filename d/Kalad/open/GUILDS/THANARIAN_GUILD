-The Thanarian human race guild-

   This guild is an expansion on the theme used in the Holy Order of
Thanar club, a theme of human supremacy fostered by the deity known as
Thanar. Thanar fosters himself as the patron god of humanity, and as
such has followers who share in his outlook on life. This race guild
provides a roleplaying option for those humans with an evil bent, or
for those that simply don't like non-humans. The emotes and the titles
of the guild all reflect the guild theme of human supremacy and
immorality at the cost of the other races' well being. The guild is
located east of the current headquarters of the Holy Order of Thanar,
beneath the city of Kabal. It is located here since the Thanar
organization is considered illegal by the Kabal authorities.

All the guild files are located in /d/Kalad/common/caravan/thanar/
with the soul being in this file /thanar_soul.c
         the shadow in this file /thanar_shadow.c
   and the joinroom in this file /joinroom.c

This is the tax computation for the guild:
