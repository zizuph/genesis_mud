-The Accursed (Duiss Aszbhar in the Drow tongue)-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Duiss Aszbhar del Undraeth, or, 'The Accursed of Undraeth' is an
organization created by Lolth, deity of the Drow, to help facilitate
the subjugation of the Dark Dominion and eventually the surface world.
The guild is best suited for the Drow and elves, since it is located
in the drow city of Undraeth. However, humans and dwarves are also
permitted in the guild, as Lolth views them as potential allies in
her conquest of the Dark Dominion and the surface world. However, 
those elves that are not Drow, as well as humans and dwarves in the
guild cannot reach the highest ranks nor gain all the guild's benefits.
There is no guild required alignment, as any that oppose Lolth are
viewed as enemies. This facilitates killing both good and evil
opponents. The primary trademark of the guild is their penchant for
poison attacks and disguises, tools useful in the battle against
all that would oppose Lolth. Most of the guild's benefits for
its members are based on the player's dexterity, intelligence and
guild stat. The Accursed is a layman thief guild.
