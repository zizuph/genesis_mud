special tax

   The lich's have a special 'gouge' special which will work on any
weapon they might be wielding, except bludgeon only weapons. The lich will
wait for a break in the enemy's defenses, then lunge out and try to
disembowl the enemy with their weapon. Depending on their skill and how
well the weapon hurts, they will do damage. The damage done is by using
the F_PENMOD formula. The weapon's pen is multilpied by 5/4. To hit
value is the hit value of the weapon. Thus, using assuming a skill of 100
and a weapon hit and pen of 40, it will do this: 
F_PENMOD(50,100) = 336. So againts the normal 280, we calculate tax with
336/280 = 1.2 
Its chance of success is 5/4 the hit value of the weapon being used. Thus,
against a normal hit attack of 40, 50/40 = 1.25
It can be done once every 4 rounds or 20 seconds.
So tax comes out like this: 1.2 * 1.25 * .25 = 37.5% combat aid.
This is under the max of 50% for lay guilds. The tax is computed by
dividing by 6, getting the value 6.25%. Since it is skill dependent, we
divide by two, and get 3.2% tax total.

direct knight
   This is similar to the move behind manuver of the calians. Only, it can
only be used on knights of the khiraa. so a lich can 'direct' a knight to
move in front of them while they move behind, and their enemies will
attack them instead. It can be used very 1/5 combat round. The combat aid
calculated from the calian guild move behind was 12%, so I will use this.
12/6 = 2% tax. Since It can only be used with other knights, I will give a
reduction of .5%, bringing it to 1.5%.

skills   = 4.68 
specials = 3.2 + 1.5%

3.2 + 5.18  + 1.5% = 9.38 %

total    = 9.38 -> 10%
