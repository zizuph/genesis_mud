   The land of Kalad is vast and unique in many ways. It is located on the
western half of the continental mass it shares with Cirath. Over the years
of its existance, the humans of the mainland have grown dominant, and have
forced the other races into hiding and near extiction. The lands of Kalad
is where war, hatred, corruption, chaos and terror dominate. War and
hatred between races. Corruption in the human cities. Chaos and terror in
Raumdor. Evil fights good, evil fights evil, good fights good. Such is the
way of Kalad, land of adventure.
    If interested in this domain, contact Kalad's Liege or Steward, and
