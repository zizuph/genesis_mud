   The blackened whip...
(/d/Kalad/common/central/wep/lord_whip.c) belongs to the
High Lord of Kabal. It is made of the skin from a black dragon, 
and has a dragon-tooth inside its handle. This weapon is 
'intelligent' in the sence that it has some powers that the 
wielder can use if he/she manages to control the whip. This power 
consists of a special inherit in the weapon. When it hits
a head, and does damage on it, it will add a delay to the
enemy's fighting. (add_attack_delay) for the time: 
20+random(20). The enemy can during this time use their own
specials etch. but they will not use any weapon themselves.
For this special to work, the wielder _must_ set his/her
wimpy to brave.
For each special that is done, the wielder is penaltied 
with max 65 and min 33, depending on spellcraft-skill,
off less mana. If the players mana
reaches 0, the whip will unwield itself and hurt the
wielder with 400 hp. This after a time, so the wielder can
avoid it if fast enough.
   To wield this whip, the player must have Spellcraft of 10,
a club-skill of 60, and a dis of 60. Failure to wield it
means 400hp of damage.
   This whip is un-brawlable when the High Lord wields it.

- The fire axe -

    This axe is wielded by the High-Lord's most trusted, and personal
guard captain. He guards the High-Lord's wife, in his castle. It is very
hard to get, because in order to kill him, you have to go through 8 of his
guards first, at the same time. Plus, the axe is very deadly, with a hit
and pen of 70/70 when the captain wields it. It has a drawback, tho. It
has a fire special, that goes off randomly. It does about 100 damage a
blow, and takes 100 mana from the wielder. Once the mana runs out, it
stops. So whoever wields this, will have thier mana drained very fast.
