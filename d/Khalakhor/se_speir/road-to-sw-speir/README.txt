This is the eastern section of the path that connects the Port Macdunn
plains with the Sa Morgan Forest. It passes through a narrow level
patch of land between the rocky beach in the south and the steep
mountains in the north. 

There is a humans' camp in the middle of this section of the path.
The camp is a pretty mundane stuff.

It connects to a "common" point.
