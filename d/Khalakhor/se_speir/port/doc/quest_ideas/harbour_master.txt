These are ideas for quests given out by the harbour master.

Shiplines Quest: One thing I was thinking of for the harbour
    master is something similar to the lines of what's listed
    in the shipline office in Sparkle, i.e. which pier lands
    ships that go where. In addition to the list, the harbour
    master could _also_ tell players how to get to certain
    places. I.e., if player asks the harbour master how to get
    to palanthas, the harbour master might tell him to take
    (captain name)'s ship (ship name) to Gelan in Calia, then
    board the walnut ship to Palanthas, including trip time,
    prices, etc.
    Now, this explained, it produced a nice idea for a quest,
    that is, players 'reviewing' shipping lanes for the harbour
    master. For the quest, they'd have to take one or more ships
    to their ultimate destination, report back captain names,
    ship names, sailing time, etc.
