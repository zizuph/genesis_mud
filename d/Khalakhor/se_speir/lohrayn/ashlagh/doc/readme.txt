                            Baile Ashlagh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baile Ashlagh is a small coastal village on an island located approximately 
between Port Macdunn and Tabor Sogh, both peninsulas forming a bay.
The buildings are primarily wood-plank structures, and the village is one 
of the cleanest and most neatly kept to be found. While it is small, Baile 
Ashlagh is of of great historical significance for the Order of Sean-Rhian, 
as it is there that "the faith" was founded. It is the port village for
Ardmaugh, the "holy city" of Sean-Rhian, which is a few miles inland
from the village.
 
You'll find the normal things one would find in a small village, and
there will probably be a few things to do in the town. Since Sean-Rhian
has a "network" of kirks and abbeys, there is alot of related
traffic through the village. There is an old stone house in the
village where the founding members of the Order lived, which is now
a shrine for pilgrimages and a tourist attraction. A map of the
village can be found in this directory. Future plans and new
additions will be noted here.
