After the reorganization the lines within and without Khalakhor will
be established like this:

1. Interdomain line:
   Cadu <-> Sparkle

2. Intradomain lines:
   Cadu <-> Eil Galaith
   Cadu <-> Sa Morgan
   Cadu <-> Port Macdunn

   Port Macdunn <-> Tabor Sogh
   Port Macdunn <-> Baile Ashlagh

3. Newbie lines:
   Sparkle - Gelan - Cadu - Enchanted Garden (Terel) (N1)
   Gelan - Sparkle - Port Macdunn - Grey Havens (N2)

Efficiently, Cadu is turning into sub-hub of the domain. Considering
its cosmopolitan nature and popularity this looks justified.

The following code will be placed:

Cadu:
* GS (Genesis ShipLines) Office
* 4 piers stretching east from the office:
  - Newbie line
  - Eil Galaith
  - Port Macdunn
  - Sa Morgan
* 3 stalls between the piers:
  - Snacks
  - Soft Drinks
  - Toilet

Eil Galaith:
* 1 pier to Cadu (utilizing current)
* 1 slot to future elven-only line

Port Macdunn:
* 4 piers utilizing 2/3 of the current piers:
  - Cadu line
  - Newbie line
  - Baile Ashlagh
  - Tabor Sogh

Sa Morgan:
* 1 pier to Cadu (utilizing current)
* Boarding block to Eil Galaith will be moved to the captain itself

Tabor Sogh:
* 1 pier to Cadu (utilizing current, unused)

Baile Ashlagh:
* 1 pier to Cadu (utilizing current)

Pan-domain:
In directory /d/Khalakhor/ship_new:
Each line will get a directory:
(*) Consider links to "both ways"

cadu-sparkle/
cadu-eilgalaith/
cadu-samorgan/
cadu-portmacdunn/
cadu-newbie/

portmacdunn-taborsogh/
portmacdunn-baileashlagh/
portmacdunn-newbie/

subdirectories:

ship: ship, deck, cabin code
crew: captains, crew code
objs: tickets, other objects code

As much as possible of the old ship code will be salvaged:
Line Cadu <-> Sparkle will be used as usual, but code moved
Line Port Macdunn <-> Sparkle will be converted for newbie usage (N2).
Line Port Macdunn <-> Baile Ashlagh will be just converted to new
code.
Line Eil Galaith <-> Sa Morgan will be used for Cadu - EG
Line Port Macdunn <-> Sa Morgan will be used for Cadu - SM
Line Port Macdunn <-> Kalaman will be used for PM - Tabor Sogh
Line Port Macdunn <-> Gelan will be converted for newbie usage (N1).
Line Port Macdunn <-> Grey Havens will be used for PM - Cadu

That means from 8 old ships 8 new will be created.
Unemployment rate - 0%
