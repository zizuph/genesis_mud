Prologue

     The following is a record of the history of the Falconers of
Volere, compiled in the year XXX by the first scribes of Faircrest.
Several documents were recovered from the ruins that stood on this
site before the erection of Faircrest Hall, among them the Journal
of Rydian, an invaluable source in the writing of this history. In
addition, first-person accounts of the founders of Faircrest,
detailing their pilgrimage to Volere and the events following 
their arrival, have been widely used as sources.
