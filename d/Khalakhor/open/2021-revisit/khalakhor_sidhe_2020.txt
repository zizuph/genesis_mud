Hey A.K.

Situation report continued for Khalakhor:

1. I have looked at the domain files.  There is *so* much stuff
that was planned but never implemented around 1997 and again in 2005.
The plan seems to be for K to be a Celtic-themed Middle Earth,
complete with humans, dwarves, elves and goblins.  I'm glad it has
not been implemented, because that would make K just like the
existing major domains... to what end?  One more domain like that
would be adding to a crowded market which is already very well served.

2. I am working through ideas that I would like to present as a pitch
for K.  I thought last week that I was almost ready, but then I had
second thoughts and have gone back to think again.

3. I have some guiding principles that I would like to stick to:

***Khalakhor will remain a mundane backwater... (at first glance)
... in all the Realms it will be the one where things are quiet
and peaceful (you can lay back in the heather), while minotaurs
and efreets and Ringwraiths can blow in from other Realms. 

The stoic people of K never bat an eyelid at this!  Why is this?
... in short it is because they know and acknowledge the Sidhe  
and have made a Covenant (Angel Covenant ref: churches) with 
the Sidhe courts which requires these often strange mortals
visit their shores, in exchange for the peace and prosperity
of Khalakhor. 


~~ Ard-Khalakhor (Ardkhalor) Sidhe notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mortals perceive the Seelie/Unseelie Sidhe as good/evil,
but these are perceptions that the Sidhe themselves don't
understand nor care about at all.

All the Sidhe of Ardkhalor owe allegiance to either the
(seelie) Samh Rad or the (unseelie) Heim Gra.  Each of
these courts has a monarch and a noble structure.
 
Both courts are capricious and callous to mortals, each in
their own way. The Samh Rad reliably favour Creation/Growth,
the Heim Gra favour Destruction/Decline -- many mortals
naively perceive good and evil respectively in these aspects.

But: creation/growth is not always good (eg. weeds and cancer),
and destruction/decline is not always evil (eg. surgery,
an old tree falling so that many new trees can have light).

If the Heim Gra were to win sway over all, the world would
be a barren lifeless wasteland, the only variation being
between those that are icy cold and those that are searing hot. 

If the Samh Rad were to win sway over all, all the world would 
be a terrifyingly dense jungle where every thing lives a life
of fear and pain at what lurks adjacent and growing within.

The perpetual conflict between the Samh Rad and Heim Gra
give rise to seasons and the ebb and flow of all the
implacable forces of nature.

The domain of the Samh Rad and Heim Gra actually extends
over all the Realms of the Donut.  They go by different names 
in different Realms if they are even acknowledged at all,
but they are always there unseen; unstoppable as the tide.

In Khalakhor, the existence of these forces has long been
known and acknowledged.  Their domain is called Ard (high)
Khalakhor, usually shortened to Ardkhalor.  Ardkhalor
exists unseen above the ever green, ever peaceful lands
of Khalakhor.

In Khalakhor the perfect balance is struck between
Creation and Destruction.

This peace and prosperity has been achieved by way of
the Covenant made with the Heim and the Samh.  

====== The Covenant: Khalakhor and Ardkhalor ==========
 
The single common feature among the Sidhe is that they
do not care about mortal lives or fates -- they use
them for their own ends.

Mortals may gain a benefit through working for the Sidhe,
but there is always some cost that mortals may not like,
sooner or later.

The humans of Khalakhor welcome mortals from all other
Realms as 'fodder' to work for the Sidhe under the terms
of the Covenant.  All villages and towns of Khalakhor
are protected and peaceful under the Angel Covenant.

Ard-khalakhor is the home of the Sidhe -- above Khalakhor.
Ardkhalor is not a mortal combat zone.  It is the zone
of combat between the immortal Sidhe.  Select mortals are 
admitted as go-betweens, couriers for the Sidhe.  This
will be the basis for a lay guild -- the Wayfinders.

Mortal players will grow through following roleplay rules and
competing politically in the Heim Gra and Samh Rad Courts.
The Sidhe find the concepts of good and evil amusing if
more than a little silly.  They enjoy seeing their mortal
servants play at good and evil for their amusement.

Opportunities will exist in the guild for segments of existing
player combat experience to be converted to quest experience.
