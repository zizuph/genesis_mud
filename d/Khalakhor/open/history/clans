Three of the major races of Khalakhor are assembled in relational
and organizational units called "clans": dwarves, humans, and
goblins. A family subset of a clan is known as a "sept". An npc
may belong to any combination of clan and sept: clan and no sept,
sept and no clan, no sept and no clan, and clan and sept.
The sept is the family name, whereas clan will usually be presented
after the family name "of the Clan X". For example, Joe Jones of
the Clan Jones belongs to the clan Jones and the sept Jones.

For organizational purposes, editors have been coded to record the
information about the clans and septs of Khalakhor. They can be
found in /d/Khalakhor/common/clans/clan_admin.c, which allows the
alteration of clan and sept details. It's a visual reference, not
used by any code, but it helps keep track of what clans may be 
found where and how each clan approaches the world. Read the
"clanhelp" and "septhelp" files after cloning the editors from
the room.
