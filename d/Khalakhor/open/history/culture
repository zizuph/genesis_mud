The Culture of Khalakhor
========================

Khalakhor culture is based on fantasy-historic Celtic culture, primarily
that of Scotland, but also blended with bits of Ireland and Wales.

The bulk of the people, of all races excepting elves, are pre-literate.
Only the high ranking humans, dwarves and goblins have understanding
of writing. The exceptions, of course, are those who are particularly
trained in literacy, like members of the Orders of the Wise.

The majority are common folk, prone to superstition and baseness.
They are born, they live and work and have fun, and they die.
Occasionally they fight in wars to preserve their lands and way of life.
