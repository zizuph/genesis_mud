                ENTRANCE QUEST FOR THE ORDER OF SEAN-RHIAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Description:
   The entrance quest is designed to allow the "aspirant" to show his
   "worthiness" to enter the guild through perserverance and to allow
   him to offer worship to the three levels of diety in the faith,
   namely the Solsheyderi (demi-gods/"saints"), the Archangel (minion
   of Order of Triad) and Ardaugh (Order of Triad). It involves the
   player thoroughly investigating the entire domain, finding clues
   and materials as to what to do.
   The quest is divided into 4 parts, an intro and then 3 rites. Each
   part may be done individual (like 4 subquests, though XP isn't added
   until the last part is completed.) The primary clue for the entire
   quest is a book called "The Revelation to Ossian" found in the kirk.
   The aspirant must be given a shamrock pendant (an autoloading object)
   which activates many parts of the quest and gets him cooperation
   from manachs when necessary. It also saves his current level of progress.
 
Skill Requirements:
   SS_AWARENESS:       10
   SS_ANIMAL_HANDLING: 10
   SS_HERBALISM:       never checked, but useful for finding herbs

Steps:
I. Initial Start
   1. The aspirant is "chosen" according to the guild rules.
   2. He is given the copper shamrock pendant. An inscription written on
      the pendant is the first clue, "Seek Wisdom in the Mysteries of Ossian."
      Having the pendant in his possession is what defines the player
      as an aspirant for the purposes of the quest.
 
      obj: sr/armour/shampend.c (autoloading - saves current level, init 0)
 
   3. The aspirant finds the book "Ashlish Ossian - The Revelations to
      Ossian" by searching the bookshelf in the manach's "living room"
      This book is a highly symbolic story of Ossian, an ancient Oracle
      of the Order, to whom visions were given. The visions symbollically
      describe the rites the aspirant must perform and are thus the major
      clue for the entire quest. The book can be found by anyone, but
      can only be read by an aspirant.
 
      room:  kirk/room/kcham1.c
      skill: SS_AWARENESS>=10
      cmd:   'search bookshelf'
      obj:   sr/book/ossian.c
 
II. Prayer for wisdom
    The first "sign" of Ossian describes an angel who kneels before the
    sun with the tricircum icon on its face and says a prayer for
    wisdom. This symbolizes the monstrance (which looks like the sun
    described) in the tabernacle of the kirk. The clue to the exact
    wording of the prayer is found on a window in the Tabor Sogh kirk,
    which has a sun with a tricircum on it.
 
    1. Find the clue to the wording of the prayer.
       room:  tabor/room/kirk1.c
       cmd:   'exa south window', 'read inscription'
    2. Find the monstrance on the small altar in the tabernacle.
       room:  kirk/room/ktabernacle
    3. 'kneel'
    4. 'pray for wisdom in the mysteries of ardaugh'
    5. The aspirant receives a little "good job, move to next step"
       vision and the pendant changes from copper to silver.
 
III. Praise of the Solheyderi
   This major step requires the aspirant to do many things in preparation
   for a rite of praise to the Solsheyderi in the kirk sanctuary.
   A. Collect ingredients for making of 9 colored candles:
      1. Getting the beeswax
         a. Find the beekeeper's hives in Tabor Sogh. Must 'climb tree'
            in a bk_groveX room to get into the tree, bk_treeX room.
            Attempts at getting the honeycombs without a beekeeper's suit
            results in NO honeycombs plus angry stinging poisonous bees
            attacking. About 10 bees fly out of the hive with each attempt
            and auto-attack. Stings "hurt" and poison causes weariness.
            Bees will chase an enemy as far as the ends of the trail
            leading from the plains into the village. The bees get tired
            and "go home" after about 3 minutes of attacking.
 
            room:  tabor/room/bk_tree1-5.c, bk_grove1-5.c
            cmd:   'take comb from hive' (doesn't really want to do this)
            npc:   tabor/npc/bee.c
 
         b. Get a beekeepers suit (hopefully before trying 'take comb
            from hive' in previous step) from the shop in Tabor Sogh.
            1. 'exa shelves' -> list of items for sale + "an old dirty box"
            2. 'exa box' -> an old leater suit, prolly garbage.
            3. 'ask conner suit' -> he puts one up for sale
            4. 'buy suit'/'wear suit' (over entire body)
 
            room:  tabor/room/shop.c
            npc:   tabor/npc/shopkeeper.c
            obj:   tabor/arm/bk_suit.c
 
         c. Get nine honeycombs - go back to trees.
            1. 'take comb from hive' - while wearing suit
               Bees fly out, but don't attack or chase. They are agressive,
               and so will attack anyone in the room not wearing a suit.
               If the player removes the suit in their presence, the bees
               will attack. If the player rewears the suit, the bees
               continue to attack and follow, but can't sting the player.
 
            obj:  tabor/obj/honeycomb.c
 
            2. player must eventually dry the honeycombs before they can
               be used.
               'suck honey from comb' - player "eats" honey
               'squeeze comb'         - honey runs on ground, disappears
 
      2. Getting the candle wicks
         a. Find the shepherd's farm on the plains and ask his wife for
            shears to shear the sheep. For a small price, he gets shears.
            'ask wife to borrow shears' -> for 12cc, wife "lends" shears
 
            room:  plains/room/home_27_9.c
            npc:   plains/npc2/shep_wife.c
            obj:   plains/wep/sheep_shears.c
 
         b. Find a sheep in the pasture and shear it to get a bale of wool.
            Wife warns player to return shears to her and threatens
            evil magic if he doesn't, but nothing really happens.
            'wield shears'
            'shear sheep with shears'
            ('give shears to wife' back in home, not req.)
 
            room:  plains/room/plains_28_7 - 30_9 (nine square - pasture)
            npc:   plains/npc2/sheep.c
            skill: SS_ANIMAL_HANDLING 10
            obj:   plains/obj/wool_bale.c
 
         c. Spin the wool into a spool of candle wick using the spinning
            wheel found in a home in Tabor Sogh.
            'switch wick'               -> can spin thread, wick, rope
            'load bin with wool'        -> bale of wool removed from player
            'spin wheel' 10 times
            'remove spool from spindle' -> get spool of candle wick.
 
            room:  tabor/room/home_9.c
            obj:   tabor/obj/spinning_wheel.c
                   tabor/obj/spool_wick
 
      3. Collect the needed herbs.
         Certain herbs are used to color the candles. Clues to which herb
         to use are found in the windows of the kirks. Though some herbs
         can be found in several places, the following rooms ensure a
         ready supply for an aspirant, if they find them. Unless otherwise
         noted, the command to get the herb is 'search here for herbs'
 
         plains_24_9:       hawthorn     shrub next to river
         plains_26_9:       dandelion    yard of shepherd's home
         plains_2_2:        fireweed     old burnt-out campfire on plains
         plains/tfor_a_5:   hazelnut     growing in forest
         kirk/kgarden7:     shamrock     growing on graves of martyrs
         ashlagh/green:     holly        holly tree growing in town square
         tabor/bk_grove3:   blueberry    'pick berry from bush' in grove
         plains_28/29/30_9: honeysuckle* 'pick flower from vine' on fence
         kirk/kgarden1:     lilac*       'pick flower from shrub' in garden
         * - same herbs used in incense quest
 
   B. Make the candles
      1. Find a mortar and pestle in the kirk apothecary on the workbench.
         Instructions on use with 'help mortar'
 
         room:  kirk/kapothecary
         obj:   sr/tool/cmortar.c pestle.c
 
      2. Find the candlewraught in the candle shop of the kirk. Instructions
         on use are on the machine. For each candle:
         'cut wick from spool with <knife>' - with any knife & spool of wick
         'thread wick through hole in mold'
         'drop honeycomb in vat'
         'light coals'           -  wait for wax to melt
         'put herb in mortar'
         'grind herb into powder with pestle'
         'take powder from mortar'
         'drop powder in vat'    - add herbal powder for color
         'open spiggot'          - drain hot colored wax into mold with wick
         'extinguish coals'      - allow to cool; wait till wax hardens
         'take candle from mold'
 
         room:  kirk/kcandles.c
         obj:   sr/tool/cwraught.c,    cmortar.c, pestle.c
                tabor/obj/honeycomb.c, wick.c,    spool_wick.
                sr/objects/powder.c,   hmcandle.c
                any knife
                herbs listed above.
         skill: SS_ALCHEMY             needed to use mortar/pestle
 
   C. Perform the rite.
      1. Get a book of canticles needed from the manachs in Tabor Sogh.
         The book is on the altar, and the manachs won't let anyone
         but an aspirant disturb the altar. Occassionally, a manach
         picks up the book and goes around chanting canticles from the
         book to the windows in the village kirk. Major hint on how
         player is to use the book. 'take book from altar'
 
         room:  tabor/room/kirk5
         obj:   sr/book/canticles.c
 
      2. With the nine colored candles and the book of canticles, the
         player is ready to perform the rite. For each window in the
         (main) kirk sanctuary, there is a pedestal. Which candle and
         which canticle for each window determined by hints in window.
         In ksanct1 and 3, there are 2 pedestals/windows each, so
         the player must specify "west/south/east" pedestal for those.
         For each window, the player does:
 
         'light <color> candle'
         'put <color> candle on [which] pedestal'
         'turn page <p#>' - for correct canticle/oran
         'chant canticle' - aspirant "cants" lines of the canticle
 
         The candle "reponds" by flickering brightly if the correct
         candle and chant were used. Candle blows out if not.
 
         room:  kirk/ksanctX.c
         obj:   sr/book/canticles.c
                sr/objects/hmcandle.c (9 from prev. step)
 
      3. As soon as the ninth chant is done (order doesn't matter),
         player receives a "good job" vision and the pendant turns
         from silver to gold.
