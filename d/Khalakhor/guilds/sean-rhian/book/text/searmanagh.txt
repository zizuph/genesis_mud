                   THE MINOR ORDER OF THE SEARMANAGH
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The minor order of the Searmanagh of Sean-Rhian consists of those members
who have advanced beyond that of a Novishagh and are preparing for
ordination into the minor order of the Diaghin. They are named for
the ancient Order of Searmanaghs of Sean-Rhian which was abolished long
ago.
 
The ancient Order of Searmanaghs, or preachers, was established during
the dark days of The Way. Defeated, few in number and under constant
attack, the followers of The Way retreated into isolation from the
rest of the world. The time came when some brave and faithful manachs
pledged themselves to bringing the practice of the faith back to the
masses who lived in ignorance.
 
Armed with only their staffs and their faith and courage, the Searmanaghs
traveled far and wide over the face of Khalakhor, preaching The Way
to all who would listen. Their vestment was the distinctive cassock,
a snug-fitting black robe with buttons down the front, symbolic of
their closeness to the faith and the darkness into which they charged.
Due to their fervor and courage, the practice of the faith once again
spread throughout Khalakhor; many abbeys and kirks were rebuilt, which
they handed over to the manachs once re-established.
 
As the Order once again enlightened the hospitable regions of Khalakhor,
the Order of Searmanaghs slowly dwindled and disappeared, having
served their purpose faithfully.
 
In honor of these ancient Searmanaghs who brought The Way back from
near destruction, the name has been adopted for those are preparing for
ordination as a Diaghin. Like the Searmanaghs of old, the Searmanagh of
today is expected to show courage and fervor in proclaiming The Way to the
world, in recruiting converts, and in growing close to their faith.
 
The ranks of the minor order of Searmanaghs consist of: The Searmanagh,
The Devoted Searmanagh, The Pious Searmanagh and the Reverend Searmanagh.
Their vestments of rank are:
 
Searmanagh:             Black Cassock
Devoted Searmanagh:     Purple Sash, Black Cassock
Pious Searmanagh:       Purple Stole and Sash, Black Cassock
Reverend Searmanagh:    Purple Tonsure, Stole and Sash, Black Cassock
 
The cope, a long purple cape with a cowl, is often worn by Searmanaghs
in rememberance of the many travels their forefathers undertook.
