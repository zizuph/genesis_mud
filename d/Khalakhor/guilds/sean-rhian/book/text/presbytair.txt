                   THE PRESBYTAIRS OF SEAN-RHIAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Presbytairs of Sean-Rhian are those Saggarts which have been chosen
and consecrated as leaders of the Order. These include the Oracle, the
Seirsanach, the Ard-Athairs and the Presbytairs.
 
The Oracle is the prophet of Ardaugh, a diety called a 'guildmaster'
in the vulgar tounges of those in darkness. He usually does not
interact to a great extent with the members of the Order, except to
reveal the will of Ardaugh to them and to serve them in their endeavors
to grow in the faith. Besides his role as prophet, his primary
function is to appoint the Seirsanach and deal with the Order through him.
 
The Seirsanach is the high father and leader of the entire order, chosen and
consecrated by the Oracle. His primary function is to maintain the unity
and harmony of the Order, leading with strength and patience, the utmost
example of devotion and faith. His distinctive vestments are the white
mitre and gold crozier, along with a white robe and purple chasuble, sash
and stole. All members of the Order owe complete obedience to him. He also
serves as the Ard-Athair of the Holy Basilica of Maighal in Ardmaugh.
 
 
The Ard-Athair is the high father of a kirk, appointed by the Seirsanach,
to whom all members of the kirk owe their complete obedience. His
primary function is to shepherd the members of his kirk with strength
and patience, an utmost example of piety and devotion. He makes all
decisions within the kirk, in union with the Seirsanach, and is
responsible for the faith and devotion of its members. His distinctive
vestments are the purple mitre and silver crozier, along with a
white robe and purple chasuble, stole and sash.
 
A Presbytair is an elder saggart of a kirk, chosen and consecrated by
the Ard-Athair, and serves as an advisor to the Ard-Athair. He may
be delegated special responsibilites within the kirk. Though he holds
no absolute authority, he is most highly respected by all members of
the Order. An Ard-Athair may select at most two Presbytairs to assist
him in his office. The distinctive vestments of a Presbytair is the
purple sash, white tonsure and silver staff, along with a white robe
and purple chasuble and stole.
