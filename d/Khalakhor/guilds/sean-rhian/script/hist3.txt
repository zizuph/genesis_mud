                     HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF SEAN-RHIAN
                         VOLUME III - AGE OF WISDOM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of Wisdom began with the defeat of the forces of Chaos at the end
of the Age of Legend. The elven nations which had lead the wars against
Chaos, and had protected The Wise in battle, were decimated by the end,
with The Wise emerging as the victors and hence the new rulers of the land.
 
As a member of The Wise, the Order of Sean-Rhian expanded greatly in
number and power across Khalakhor. Taking on now both spiritual and
civil responsibilities as a whole, priests of the faith developed
into two groups along these lines. Members of the Order of Saggarts
of Sean-Rhian focused on the civil and political responsibilities,
while the newly established Order of Manachs of Sean-Rhian concentrated
on spiritual work. These manachs cloistered themselves in the kirks of
Sean-Rhian and the attached abbeys which they built, and eventually
were ordained as the caretakers of these sites, freeing the Saggarts
for their work in governance.
 
Lasting less than two centuries, the Age of Wisdom began to wane when
the forces of Chaos, wizened by their defeat years before, re-emerged
newly prepared to do battle against the powers of The Wise. Their
victories in defeating the power of The Wise brought the Age to its
end, and eventually saw the destruction of several of the orders who
composed The Wise. Sean-Rhian would barely survive, most of its Saggarts
and lay Disciples killed, leaving the Manachs to retreat to safety to
ensure the continuance of the practice of the faith, now loosed from
the union with The Wise, the union now passed into history.
