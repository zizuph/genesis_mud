                     HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF SEAN-RHIAN
                         VOLUME V - THE AGE OF CLANS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of Clans, the modern age of Khalakhor, began with the overthrow
of the Highlord Braynt by powerful clans which first developed in the
highlands of Khalakhor. This was a precarious time for the order, as many
saw the cooperation of the order with the Highlord as an alliance with
him. The order was expelled from many territories now ruled by clan
leaders. Fortunately, mostly in areas where the order was well-established
and known by the people not to be a tool of the Highlord, the order was
allowed to remain to continue their service to the people.
 
Over the ensuing years the order developed various relationships with the
clans. Mistrusted and even banned in some areas, the order is still
accepted as an asset to the community in many villages. The leaders
of some clans have made the local leaders of the order their trustworthy
advisors, though local leaders are cautioned not to establish ties too
closely, as this may become detrimental in the future as clans skirmish
and leaders squabble within.
 
Having learned to live and operate within the system of clans of
Khalakhor, the order continues to prosper. Of greatest note of events
in recent history is the announcement that the Order of Saggarts of
Sean-Rhian is to be re-established, allowing even foreigners to the
land of Khalakhor to be admitted. Leaders of the order are preparing
diligently for the new wave of members expected, those who wish to
join the order and become active amongst the people in Khalakhor and
even other lands, outside the cloistered walls of the abbey.
