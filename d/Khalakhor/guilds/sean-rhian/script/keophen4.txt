                       The Fourth Book of St. Keophen
                         The Rule of St. Keophen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I write this Rule to you, beloved follower of the Way, so that you may
know how to live the life of the Way within our Order, in your quest to
attain perfect harmony in the power of the Most High.
 
To worship the Most High, the power of Order of the Triad which rules our
   domain, is to be the center of your life's endeavours. To practice
   the meditations, and the canticles, and the rites which are handed
   on to you through the teachings of our Order, to give worship and glory
   and honor and praise to the Most High who is worthy of such, all the
   days of your lives;
 
To adore Maigal the Archangel of the Most High, through who's revelation
   our Order receives all its knowledge, and through who's intercessions
   with the Most High our Order receives all its power. To practice
   the meditations, and the canticles, and the rites which are handed
   on to you through the teachings of our Order, to adore and honor
   and praise the Archangel that he may grant you the benefits of his
   intercession;
 
To venerate the Aposteloi of the Most High, through who's intercession with
   the Most High and his Archangel the blessings and powers of are Order
   are granted. To practice the meditations, and the canticles, and the
   rites which are handed on to you, to venerate the holy seven who have
   walked amongst us and attained the perfect harmony in union with the
   power of the Most High, that through your communion with them the
   blessings of the Most High may be granted unto you;
 
To heed the the words of the Oracles of the Most High, to receive their words,
   keep them in your hearts, and to pass them on to all generations who are
   to come. To acknowlege the pronouncements of the Oracles as the revelations
   of the words of the Most High, his Archangel, and his Aposteloi, that
   the purity of our faith be maintained throughout all generations;
 
To obey the commandments of the Archepiskopos who is set over you by the
   ordination of the Archangel and the Aposteloi, who is given all authority
   to teach and interpret and ordain the Episkopoi, to maintain the peace
   and unity of the Way, and to maintain the purity of our faith;
 
To obey the commandments of the Episkopos who is set over you, that by his
   teachings and admonitions you may grow in unity with your brethren
   and in harmony with the spirit of the Most High, and that the teachings
   of the Way be given to all the nations, so that all who heed the
   calling of the Most High may embark on their journey in search of
   harmony and union;
 
To honor your elders within the Order, for they have come before you and
   make themselves an example for you to follow, that you too may complete
   your journey in search of harmony and union;
 
To respect one another and strive to maintain the peace and harmony of
   the Order; for without respect there is no harmony, and without
   harmony there is no peace, and without peace there is no unity, and
   without unity it is impossible to reach the transcendent state of
   perfect communion with the power of the Most High; forgive the
   transgressions of your brother when he repents, and expel him from
   your communion if he does not, for even one in disharmony may
   cause the fall of the entire communion. A servant to all your brethren
   you shall be.
 
To spread the faith in the worship of the Most High, the adoration of his
   Archangel, the veneration of his Aposteloi, the adherence to his Oracles,
   and the obedience of his servants. To protect the purity of the faith,
   that the blessings of the harmony and peace granted unto us may be
   granted unto all the world;
 
To use the powers and blessings granted through your communion to bring
   yourself and others into a more perfect unity with the power of the
   Most High, and to destroy all that is evil and threatens the worship
   of the Most High, the adoration of his Archangel, the veneration of
   his Aposteloi, the adherence to his Oracles, and the peace of his
   servants; To defend each other when you are persecuted, even to the
   point of martyrdom which gains for you a great blessing;
 
All these things you are to keep in your heart, and follow with your mind,
and act with your body, so that your spirit may enter a more perfecty
union with the power of the Most High, and find the peace and harmony
granted therein.
