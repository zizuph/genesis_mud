                     HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF SEAN-RHIAN
                                PROLOGUE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus is written the history of the Order of Sean-Rhian, The Way of the
Solsheyderi, the Path to Harmony; as it is related to those who do not
walk our path, for their edification in truth; as it is written in the
three hundred and forty fifth year of the Age of Clans of our motherland
Khalakhor, in the year that foreigners first trod upon our shores; as it
is written by Amerdan, Manach of the Order of Sean-Rhian and Ard-Scoillar
of Ardmaugh; being approved by Jonaugh III, Seirsanach of Sean-Rhian,
under his sign and seal.
 
Be it known that in the beginning, and from all time since, the land of
Khalakhor has been shaped by the spiritual triumvirate called The Triad,
the powers of Order, Balance and Chaos. The form of the land of Khalakhor,
and of its seas, and of its creatures, and of its history has been guided
and twisted by the struggle between these great powers. It is in the lands
where Order ruled that the noble race of the Elves of Khalakhor were
formed, and nurtured, and evolved, living in peace and harmony with all
things, until the influence of the power and minions and races of the
other lands were to invade. It is amongst these noble Elves, who were
chosen to bring Order to the world, that The Way began; and from hence,
has been preached to the barbarians, consecrating many of all races to
the enlightenment and truth of the peace and harmony of the power of Order.
