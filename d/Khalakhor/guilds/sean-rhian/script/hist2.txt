                     HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF SEAN-RHIAN
                        VOLUME II - THE AGE OF LEGEND
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of Legend was a time of great wars for the land of Khalakhor,
powerful minions of Chaos in control of vast goblin armies invading the
lands of the other races. It began around three thousand years ago and
lasted over one and a half centuries.
 
Most of the Disciples of The Way who were not Saggarts joined the elven
armies which lead the battles against the forces of Chaos. Meanwhile,
the leadership of the Order retreated to the safest areas of the
elven lands and developed their priestly powers to aid the armies
arrayed against the goblins. Battles were often as much spiritual
as physical during this Age, and those who could wield the
magical powers proved to be essential.
 
It came to pass that a group of magical and priestly orders united to form
"The Wise" in an attempt to strengthen their powers through cooperation.
Sean-Rhian was one of these orders. The Wise took to the battlefields,
shielded by the elven armies, and channeling great powers in concert, 
thoroughly defeating the minions of Chaos and driving the goblin armies out
of their lands. The victory was bitter-sweet, however, as the elven armies
were nearly destroyed defending The Wise.
 
By the end of this age, the ranks of the non-priestly Disciples of The Way
were decimated, sacrificing themselves in battle or joining the Order of
Saggarts. During this time, the Order of Saggarts developed their skills
for use in battle as well as in times of peace. The end of this age also
found the Order of Saggarts bound to The Wise, who would rule in the age
to come.
