Eria's symbol is the 3-spoked pinwheel of blades. The blades represent
courage, skill, & strength respectively, as well as the mind, body &
the spirit. The curve of the spinning pinwheel blades gives the
impression that they are unstoppable, inevitable.

Eria is said to appear to warriors during the midst of battle, a 
shining apparition of a fair warrior maiden. Those that pray to her
look for Eria to appear to them, should they die on the battle field,
& spirit their souls back to the Halls of the Eternally Courageous.
