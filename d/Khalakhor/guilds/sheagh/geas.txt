Sheagh d'Eria Entrace Quest

The Sheagh are built largely on the respect they earn, and thus their
repuation. There shall be 3 parts of the quest: addressing the heart,
the body & the spirit.
Hopefuls will need to prove themselves as strong, courageous & wily,
and above being greedy, power-hungry & vain.

The geases they must endure will be tough and dangerous, and they may
not call on the aid of others in their quest.
