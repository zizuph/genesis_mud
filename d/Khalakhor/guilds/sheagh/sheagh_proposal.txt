                       === SHEAGH D'ERIA ===
                         (The Host of Eria)

Throughout the lands of Khalakhor you may occassionally find yourself
face to face with a stern-faced man, a heavy brass earring of a 3 
bladed pinwheel over a disc of sworls hanging from his left ear.
Rarer still to see them in numbers, for The Host need no companions
in their patrols of Khalakhor more than their patron Goddess Eria.
In Eria they worship battle skill, courage and strength. These make up
the three blades of her pinwheel. In return, Eria blesses them with
clerical powers, spells of war in return for their offerings from the
trophies taken from their vaunted enemies.
The Sheagh carry the traditional sword of their forefathers, shunning
the spear for it's bulkiness over their long patrols. Always by their
side the black dirk called the Sgian Dubh. They are always welcome
amongst the clans, their presence and fortune in battle is legendary,
their skills with salves precious.
Though grim and scarred, the Sheagh are required to be versed in
poetry. They are knowledgable about, though thankfully immune, to
politics and the squabbles of the clans. They are in fact forbidden
from interference.
Since the Second War of the Races the Sheagh d'Eria have been instru-
mental in the defence of the people of Khalakhor. They wander the
coastlines, man the barricades facing the goblin hordes, and when
they arrive to battle they are guaranteed to turn the tide in their
favour.

The Sheagh d'Eria oath:
   "Truth in our hearts. Strength in our hands. Consistency in our
tongues."

                === ERIA - Maiden of Battle ===

Eria is a major god of the pantheon of Khalkhor. Eria is the patron
god of warrior skills, tactics and courage. Some say Eria is a sister
of or another aspect of the tri-goddess the Morrigan.

Eria's symbol is the 3-spoked pinwheel of blades. The blades represent
courage, skill, & strength respectively, as well as the mind, body &
the spirit. The curve of the spinning pinwheel blades gives the
impression that they are unstoppable, inevitable.

Eria is said to appear to warriors during the midst of battle, a 
shining apparition of a fair warrior maiden. Those that pray to her
look for Eria to appear to them, should they die on the battle field,
& spirit their souls back to the Halls of the Eternally Courageous.

              === Sheagh D'Eria SPELLS PROPOSAL ===

The selection of spells for the Sheagh are meant to represent the
specialisation of the clergy in battle, and as such they have no
healing or cleansing spells, and only minor skills in divination.

             === Sheagh D'Eria RESTRICTIONS & TAX ===

At this stage I anticipate around 25% tax, using only the occu-
pational guild slot. The guild will be focused on the protection
of the allied races of Khalakhor. Admission will require the
player to have a fairly decent high level of reputation in the
lands of Khalakhor. This hidden domain-skill(s) will be modified
only by actions within Khalakhor, but work in a somewhat similar
way to the KoS prestige. Actions taken to aid Khalakhor (such as
completing quests to aid the Allies races) will result in a posi-
tive modification to this skill, and any blow against Khalakhor's
allied races will result in a hefty blow against.
Players who betray the trust of the forces of order will suffer a
hefty blow vs. their reputation, which may result in an automatic
reduction of skills, spells, or even ejection from the Sheagh.
It is likely that there will be a quest to aid the lands of Khal-
akhor be available for players to solve in order to join the
guild.
I anticipate a leadership of only 3 eldar clergy, requiring a
consensus on any guild decisions, or on admissions of new members
who have met the requirements.
