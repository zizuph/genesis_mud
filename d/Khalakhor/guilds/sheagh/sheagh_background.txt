Sheagh d'Eria (The Host of Eria)

Wandering Heros, patrollmen of Khalakhor.
They patrol the borders of civilisation, checking for signs of invasion from
outsiders & the goblins, fomorians & fir bolgs of the North.

They are greatly respected by the community for their good fortune & skills in
battle & healing, and the favour they bring from their patron deity, Eria
(Goddess of Warrior Skill).

The Sheagh take the sword as their weapon of choice. At their side is always 
the Dir Sogh, the black dirk, in respect to their warrior heritage.
The Sheagh are capable of calling on battle assistance in several forms from 
Eria, leaving painful wounds and taking far more damage than a mortal should.
Their unquenchable battle ferocity stirs courage in their allies and fear into
their enemies' hearts.

Sheagh d'Eria warriors may be members of the clans, but their level of 
responsibility exclude them from clan politics. Luckily they are well enough 
respected where their clan Thanes don't involve them in politics, or at least
most of the time.
