Clans of Khalakhor


Guild Type: Race with the option of joining an Occupational option. 
Tax:        1.0 - 3.0%
Race:       Human/Dwarf


The Clans of Khalakhor is a racial guild designed to further Celtish roleplay within
Khalakhor. There are six Clans within Khalakhor spread about the land in various
starting locations. The Clans offer 2 levels of racial and will offer an additional
occupational option in the future.

I choose Human and Dwarven as the possible choices to join the race guild because 
these two races work closely together within the Domain. Sept's or Clans do not
necessarily need to be blood related. Sometimes smaller families or Septs 
join larger Clans for security, protection or to further commerce. 


Level One:
The first level of the Clans will be the initial joining of the guild. The 
member will be allowed to train in the "basic" (see basic skill list below) skills.
The member will be required to choose a SEPT or Surname which will be provided 
at the joining process. The joinroom will be located within the South East
Speir, within the city of: Port Macdunn.

Level Two:
Spread throughout Khalakhor are the Clans that the 'level one member' will 
be allowed to join. They may join only one Clan. In order to join the 
Clan they must be 'adopted' first, by one of the Clan members.  At which point
their tax will go up an additional 2% for skills and Guildhome ammenaties.
 Each Clan has its own starting location and skill set in addition to 
the 'basic skill list'. These skills  will be important later on 
should the Clan member join the Occupational option.

     Tax formula: (max level - untaxed = tax levels / 60 * tax in = tax)
