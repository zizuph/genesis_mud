Guild Overview and Purpose (from joining document)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Being a Blademaster means a number of things, most important only 
to those of us who bear the Chain and the Thistle.

The Thistle is a symbol for the Blademasters, though the reason is
lost with the passage of time, the symbol is still used. Wherever
you see it, a Blademaster has been. There are many allies to the
society, tailors and smiths who service our dress and weapons,
particularly, will display the thistle on their shops, so that we
might recognize it.

The Chain is a symbol as old as the thistle, but is remembered.
It symbolizes the chain of attack in a fight, where each position,
parry, and thrust must be as strong as the others. As the strength
of a chain depends on its weakest link, so does the strength of your
blade depend on your weakest ability. You can always see a Blademaster
by the chain on his or her collar.

There is no guildhall for the Blademasters, but past members, those
merchants and craftsmen who bear display the thistle, will often
allow us to make use of their places of business. In these places,
you may elect to start there.

As we have no guildhall, and as such no trainers, the guild tax is
minor, and put towards only those few abilities you will obtain as
a Blademaster.

The Blademasters have no regard for alignment or race, for us there
is only the sword. As such, anyone of sufficient skill may be a 
Bladeveteran. Beware your skill does not fall below confident veteran,
else your claim to the title is forfeit, and you will no longer be a
Blademaster.

Branches
~~~~~~~~
One can join the blademasters as a layman guild.

Skills Trained:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The guild itself offers no training in any skills. It simply builds
on the sword ability that they already have.
    
Combat Specials:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Battack
  ~~~~~~~
    Files: /d/Khalakhor/guilds/blademasters/special/blade_attack.c
    
    Battack is a very standard damage special that now uses the
    Genesis common specials system. The combat aid given is 48%, as
    it is the only ability that the guild offers.
            
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
    and all other calculations are set. It is currently set to 48%.
        
    Frequency
    ---------
    Being a layman special, the frequency of the battack is rather
    long. It takes 25 seconds for a full cycle of Blademasters. There
    may be reason to bring down this rather slow special.
    
    Hit chance
    ----------
    Tohit maxes out at 90, which gives a hit percentage of 82%. The actual
    tohit formula is found here:
    
    /* attack_hit modifications added by Teth, 8 Feb 2002 */
    /* Ok, let's deal with the attack_hit modifications */
    /* First we halve the wchit value over 40           */
    if ( tohit > 40 )
    {
        tohit = 40 + ( (tohit - 40) / 2 );
    }

    /* Ok, increase hit by guildstat as a %, capped at 100% */
    guildstat = player->query_base_stat(SS_LAYMAN);
    guildstat = ( guildstat > 100 ) ? 100 : guildstat;
    tohit += ftoi( itof(tohit) * itof(guildstat) / 100.0 );

    /* But we don't want attack_hit getting any higher than */
    /* 90 in any event. This is a layman attack, after all  */
    tohit = ( tohit > 90 ) ? 90 : tohit;    
    
    Penetration
    -----------
    Penetration is calculated using the person's strength and guild stat
    for the stat portion, and the sword skill for the
    skill portion of it. Of course, penetration also depends on the
    weapon's pen.

    Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
