Recalc of Gladiator Charge & Berserk
------------------------------------

Berserk:
-------
Berserk looks fine to me, to begin with. There will be
some accelerated healing taking place while berserk, of
course, but it's a matter of 4 or 5 extra hp every 
healing round, so probably not worth the math involved,
especially as the existing 'rounding up' is probably
more than this calculation would add to the combat
advantage anyway. So, we'll stick with the calculated
value of 11% combat advantage.

Charge:
-------
Some things here require attention, however. We'll start
with the normal assumption, stats & skills = 100, normal
tohit & pen = 40, etc.

Frequency:
One charge every 28 seconds.

    Reset modifer: 1/5.6

Tohit modifier:
Charge uses a hard-coded base chance tohit of 100 in the
cb_tohit() call. As a normal hit is based off the wielded
weapon's tohit, this produces a modifier of:

    Tohit modifier = 100/40

Wcpen modifier:
Stats used to calculate charge are capped at 150, divided
by 5, and added together. The results of this addition is
passed as the first argument to F_PENMOD, the player's charge
skill + 45 is the second argument. Stats involved are str
and con. This means that a charge attack will do:

    wc_pen = F_PENMOD(100/5 + 100/5, 100 + 45)
           = F_PENMOD(40, 145)
           = 346

For a normal attack:

    wc_pen = F_PENMOD(40, 100)
           = 280
 
Wcpen modifier is therefore

    wc_pen modifier = 346/280

While berserk, however, these value for the wc_pen changes
a bit. As the player's str and con are increased by 15%,
we can approximate this change by using stats of 115 instead
of 100 calculating the pen (it doesn't effect reset time
or tohit chance).

    wc_pen = F_PENMOD(115/5 + 115/5, 100 + 45)
           = F_PENMOD(46, 145)
           = 384

Wcpen modifier while berserked is therefore

    wc_pen modifier = 384/280.

While not berserked, the total CA is:

    CA = 1/5.6 * 100/40 * 346/280
       = 55.2%

While berserked, the total CA is:

    CA = 1/5.6 * 100/40 * 384/280
       = 61.2%

Taking into consideration that berserk works 50/65ths
of the time, we can get an average CA by doing:

    CA = (15/65 * 55.2%) + (50/65 * 61.2%)
       = 12.7% + 47.1%
       = 59.8%

Since this CA takes the effects of berserk into account,
the cumulative effect has been taken into consideration,
and the CAs of the two specials can simply be added to
obtain their overall combat advantage:

    Overall CA = 11% + 59.8%
               = 70.8%

Which is well under the 100% CA advantage occ guilds may
offer. Tax for this special is then:

    Tax = 59.8% / 6 / 2
        = 4.98% -> 5% tax
