          Rites and practices continually reformed and integrated into
          the practices of the Order of the Wise.
          Attention of the Order turns to politics and ruling, away

   -1245: Attention of Order refocuses on defense against Chaos;
          Powers of the Order start to decrease, many lost in battle
          or burnt out in enchanting weapons and armies.
   -1200: With most kirks and priories destroyed or in the hands of
          others, the monastic branch disappears.
   -1145: The Order is exhausted and in disarray; central authority is lost;
          Society of Sean-Rhian emerges from hiding, demanding separation
          from The Wise and a return to the Ancient Rites.
   -1100: The Order of Ard-Rhian breaks off from The Wise, who have
          lost almost all their power and fallen into disarray. Leaders
          of the Order however pledge to continue development of practices
          and not to return to the Ancient Ways.
   -1050: Great Schism - Order of Sean-Rhian breaks off from Ard-Rhian.
          Sean-Rhian grows in power and members, Ard-Rhian continues
          to dwindle; battles between warlords favoring each side occur.
   -1000: Shean-Rhian occupies and restores the Basilica
   -700:  Great Union - powerless remnant of Ard-Rhian abandons its
          leaders and practices and reunite with Sean-Rhian, ending
          the schism.
   -600:  Constant battles with forces of chaos with little protection
          from warlords forces entire order to retreat to the Basilica;
          Entire order becomes monastic;
AGE OF CLANS:
  -300:  Order has grown large enough that groups of monks are sent out
         amongst the clans to re-establish kirks and priories, which
         become monastic communities in cooperation with the clans with
         whom they live. They act as schools and as mediators of disputes.
  -1:    Order decides to revive secular (non-monastic) branch of priests
         and to admit people from other lands (founding of the guild).
