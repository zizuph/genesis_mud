The Ways of Stone.

	These will be gates, in which people can travell from one point in 
Khalakhor to another.  The gates were created by the Wise and over the ages 
travell by these gates have only been remembered by Sages and other Khalakhor
wise men.  The gates will resemble stone henge... massive blocks of stone 
arranged in a pattern.  Players can only access areas within the gate after 
doing quests.   The inital quest shall give the player a spell (to activate
the gates) and access to open locations... as we open more locations we 
introduce more quests so players can use the gate to get to them.  Each part
or region of Khalakhor contains 3 gates... the islands don't have any since 
the Ways of Stone can't reach them because they aren't connected to the 
mainland.  If we introduce this, it should never replace boat and other forms
of travell... but will give us another option... I want to have an area in the
northern area _only_ accessable by a gateway.  The name can and probably should
be changed....  The Ways of Stone is something I just came up with until I 
think up something better... suggestions are welcome.




A rough stectch of what the Stone Ways would look like.
