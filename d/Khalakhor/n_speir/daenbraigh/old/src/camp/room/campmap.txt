This is the revised version of the original layout idea, and since
I am the one coding it, this is how it's going to be :)

Ok, my ascii drawing skills aren't very good, but you get the picture.

p : path around the camp where the patrols are going to be.
W : Watchtowers with guard(s?)
T : Large tent. Haven't decided what there should be in them yet,
    but one of them will contain a prisoner (for an upgoming quest)
E : The entrance to the camp. Will most likely be guarded by 2-4 goblins
    with low grade equipment, but they will be highly perceptive.
X : Dunno about those... might do something special there sometime
O : Officers planning room in the command tent.
M : The general lives here with his bodyguards.
