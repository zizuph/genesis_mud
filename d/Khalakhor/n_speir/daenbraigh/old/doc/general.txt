The goblin village is the first stage of implementing of the northern
speir of Khalakhor.

The village is the entry point. It has a pier and a few rooms of a
regular town. It is populated by goblins and possibly a few renegade
humans and dwarves. The elves and hobbits are attacked on sight.
The good-aligned mobiles are attacked on sight. The neutral-aligned
humans, gnomes and dwarves (up to wicked?) are attacked on sight. Village
attackers are also rebuked and attacked when returned - per reboot.

The village is going to feature an all-trade shop, a pub, a post office,
a smith and an elder questmaster. Also a few houses with meaningless
inhabitants and an some armed forces (tower and camp) will be added.
Possibly the military commander will be a questmaster as well.

The village will be located in the center of western coastline of
north speir. A path southeast in the depth of the continet will open,
leading to the guild of hammerhands - bludgeon specialist alternative
to blademasters. The hammerhands will be for neutral and evil-aligned
goblins and dwarves.
