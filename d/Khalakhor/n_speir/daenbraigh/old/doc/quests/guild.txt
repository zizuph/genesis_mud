Tasks:

1) There is a courier that likes to sit in the pub instead of
   delivering messages as quick as possible. A proof of his pubtime
   must be brought to the guild. You need to catch him when he is in
   the pub and buy him beers as many as possible until he spills the
   beer on him. Then mention guildmaster's name - he will remember he
   has to deliver to him. Offer to escort him and bring him to the
   guild. The smell of the courier yields the reward.
   
2) [possibly join quest]? bring five good DIFFERENT clubs to the GM.
   he will produce a list of what clubs he wants - by weight, volume,
   price and hands to wield.
