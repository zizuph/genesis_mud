Tasks:

1) Carry a message to the HH guildmaster (easy walking, needs
   introduction)

2) Clean the village from refuse: find a cart, collect garbage in each
   room and load on it. Then go to pier and dump it into water. You
   can collect without cart, but it is going to be tedious:
   Garbage in a room is circa 250l, cart volume is 2500l, there are 9
   rooms. If you do it by hand, you collect. You also begin to stink.

3) Combat quest - need to go to another speir, kill someone and bring
   something.
