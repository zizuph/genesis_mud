Hi,

Ok sorry for this loooong mail :)

I'm getting close to done (I hope!) with the baits and the quest. Became alot of details to tend to, to what I first imagined would be something that should be fairly easy ;)

But, I guess there's some details left - especially around the quest setup, like the exp amount maybe the most important. But maybe how/where to keep the defined variables, info and so on. I saw it looked like you started working on something new to manage quests. 

Now all code related to the quest (exception the actual baits) are in the fisherman:
/d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/npc/angler.c
He will be standing at the end of the cadu pier (to expose one of the entrances the the Golbar camp):
/d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/nyreese/cadu_pier5.new.c
The room is made fishable, with the saltwater biom for the time beeing.

The three baits and options are setup with test room for the updated base codes. Could perhaps be good to discuss the numbers, how easy they should be to find.

* Port Macdunn forest
Room base: /d/Khalakhor/se_speir/plains/room/tforbase.new.c
Bait: /d/Khalakhor/se_speir/plains/obj/catalpa-worm.c
The forest consists of 118 rooms. Now setup with 0-3 worms, so on average 1.5 worms per room. Using 50% chance to find a worm with superior layman hunting skill. So if a player scour through the entire forest it would mean on average 89 worms.

* Eil-Gailiath
Room base: /d/Khalakhor/inisi/galaith/room/isle_base.new.c
           /d/Khalakhor/inisi/galaith/room/islebase.new.c
Bait: /d/Khalakhor/inisi/galaith/obj/white-maggot.c
43 rooms, on average 1.5 worms per room, 50% chance => 32 maggots

* Carisca
Creature:  /d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/npc/grugg2.new.c
          (add it to grugg.c as well? - the version dropping the dust needed for quest)
Bait: /d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/obj/grugg-limb.c
The grugg2 is cloned in 3 rooms
(grugg in one)
Grugg can have 5+3 (cut off + leftovers) limbs at most. On average the grugg2 may drop 4 limbs, if the battle last long enough. With 3 monsters a total of 12 limbs in average (16 if we include the grugg.c)
Perhaps that's too few? Add a couple of more gruggs on the island.

I've also made the snail into bait
/d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/obj/snail.new.c
I added the general bait description to the snail, but maybe I should leave the long description as it were before?

Then for the atmosphere, a suggestion for the two fish metioned in the quest (third option just uses herring, refering to the meal at the local inn as you suggested) that I will send to Arman if it looks good:

void
nyreesean_bass()
{
    name = "bass";
    short = "nyreesean bass";
    long = "This is a species of bass found only in the waters " +
        "around Nyreese. Primarily an ocean-going fish native to " +
		"the waters of Khalakhor, though it can also be found in " +
		"shallow coastal waters. Silvery grey in color with a " +
		"dark-greenish color on the back.\n";
    adj = ({ "nyreesan" });
    vol = 5750;
    wgt = 5750;
    val = 175;
    bait_val = 0;
}

void
cariscan_devilfish()
{
    name = "devilfish";
    short = "cariscan devilfish";
    long = "The cariscan devilfish, or the cariscan devil ray, is " +
	       "a smaller species in the ray family. Native to the waters of " +
		   "Khalakhor and especially around the island Carisca, it bears " +
		   "characteristic yellow to orange spots on the back resembling " +
		   "stains of lava.\n";
    adj = ({ "cariscan" });
    vol = 75000;
    wgt = 75000;
    val = 2000;
    bait_val = 0;
}

And will ask to create a new biom called Nyreese, based on saltwater and then with our two custom fish.
I will also ask Arman if it's possible for him to make it so that they have a higher chance to be caught if using the correct bait. (If it's possible perhaps make the devilfish very rare with other baits, but normal chance with the correct bait - and then set a higher value so it could be worth fishing for to earn money)

I think that was all for now.. I realize you are busy with other things, and maybe too many details in here. Most important is to get the quest details setup correctly I guess.
