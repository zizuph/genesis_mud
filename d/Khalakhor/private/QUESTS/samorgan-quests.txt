       food and drink from the local pub
Skills: none
Risks: none
The lieutenant at the common board room needs help with delivering
food/drink to the guard towers at four corners of the village. The order is
different for each sergeant and each guard crew in the towers. The
order is given by the sergeants and the guards on the spot. The
food/drink is the one at the local pub, so a player needs to purchase
it and deliver one portion per sergeant, and three portions to the
guards. After all four locations have been fed, the player needs to go
back to the lieutenant for the reward. The quest data stores in a
player property, i.e. quitting mid-quest will reset the progress.
