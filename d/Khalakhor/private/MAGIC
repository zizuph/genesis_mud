===============
File:          /d/Khalakhor/common/herbs/beatha.c
Creator:       Teth
Date:          January 22, 1998
Cloned by:     /d/Khalakhor/common/herbs/herb_master.c
Related Files: /d/Khalakhor/common/poisons/beathap.c
Magic prop:    ({ 85, "life" })
Other info:    This herb has a two-fold effect. It has an
               overwhelming amount of life magic, and thus
               heals living creatures upon ingestion,
               depending on a random amount added to 
               a 2x multiplier on life spells skill.
               However, to undeads, it clones a poison
               which will cause grave harm, causing reductions
               in stats, hp, and fatigue.

File:          /d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/obj/wand.c
Creator:       Arman

Cloned by:     /d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/npc/refnas.c
Related Files: Heal spell /d/Khalakhor/inisi/roke/obj/wand_heal_spell.c
Magic prop:    ({ 25, "enchantment" })
Other info:    Wand of Healing.

               Recoded by Arman to align with the new magic system.
               Based on the original magic wand coded by Gresolle 
               and later Glindor.

               This strange wooden stick is a wand of healing. 
               For those with spellcraft greater than 20, they 
               can hold it and use it to heal themselves or others 
               with the 'zap' command.

               The heal spell of the wand is based on the standardised 
               heal spell /d/Genesis/specials/std/spells/heal.c, with 
               a combat aid assigned to it of 35. This results in a 
               heal range of somewhere between 30 to 80 hitpoints per
               casting.

               The effectiveness of the heal is dependent on the holders 
               spellcraft skill. The wand has 10 charges, which recharge 
               at 1 charge every 30 minutes.
