The Distillers of Khalakhor - Craft Guild

1. General

The Distillers of Khalakhor are a Craft Guild that allows members to:
* Distill their own hard spirits
* Consume these spirits
* Sell them in pubs
* Taste existing spirits and compare their potency
* Evaluate how many drinks of a type they can consume to go to EO

The guild will be located in the western area of the plains
surrounding Port Macdunn, next to a small river, for the freshwater
necessary for distilling.

2. Distilling

The distiller shall apply for distilling a certain spirit from the
guild master. Based on random factors and the economical situation,
the guild master may approve the application or suggest a different
spirit. After achieving mastery in that spirit the distiller can
switch to a different spirit as well.

The distiller needs to gather components for the spirit he or she is
specializing in. Some of them would be available in the guild. Some
may need a bit more of an effort. The instructions for distillation of
each spirit are in the guild library.

With the components at hand, the distiller may start the process. In
the corresponding room the equipment should be operated to produce a
container of spirit that will later need to age.

The aging will be in scale of 1 gameday = 1 year of aging.

The resulting spirit will be of a slightly randomized alcohol content,
and of randomized quality, function of the distilling skill and good
control of the distilling process. A bad quality drink can poison the
consumer (mana poison).

Aging:
* Improves slightly the alcohol content (angels' share)
* Improves significantly the price
* Does not affect the quality unless aged for too long.

The spirits can be examined by the Guildmaster to prevent low quality
drinks from leaving the guild.

3. Consumption of spirits.

The spirits can be poured into bottles (available in the guild, or the
ones coming from Calia, etc.) Then they can be drunk. Low quality
drinks can cause poison, otherwise they're regular alcoholic drinks.

4. Trading in spirits.

The spirits can be sold by bottles or by barrels. There will be a pub
in Khalakhor that will implement the initial support for spirit
trade. The price of the drink will be determined by:
* The age of the spirit
* The reputation of the distiller:
  - previous trades
  - guild level
* The availability of the drink itself at the pub
* The availability of the hard spirits at the pub

The bartender/the owner shall taste the spirit before the
transaction. If the quality is low, and/or the bartender gets
poisoned, the reputation suffers a heavy blow, and the trade is
outright rejected. The next successfull trade will be at a very low
price.

Each successfull trade yields general experience not dissimilar to the
Minstrel performances at the pubs.

5. Tasting

Based on the Tasting skill of the distiller, he or she can compare two
drinks and rule which one is stronger. That should be completely
similar to the appraise object/value implementation. It will not
change the drinks, but will cost a tiny bit of mana to the distiller.

6. Evaluation

Similarly to the comparison of drinks, the distiller can estimate how
much of the drink he or she can consume before getting extremely
obliviated.

7. Guild rooms

* Start location
* Join room
* Guildmaster study
* Library
* Shop
* Distilling halls:
  - whisky (barley)
  - rum (sugar)
  - brandy (grapes)
  - calvados (apples)
  - more to come
* Each hall also has a barrel storage room

8. Skills in the guild:

* Trading: Sup. Craftsman
* Appraise Object: Sup. Journeyman
* Appraise Value: Sup. Journeyman
* Herbalism: Sup. Layman
* Alchemy: Sup. Layman
* Tasting: Sup. Guru
* Distilling: Sup. Guru

Training of all skills depends on the following stats of the member:
(except Tasting - see below)
* Guild Age in days/seconds. 50 days required for max skills.
* Guild Level is in successful distillation attempts/pub trades. 100
of each are required for max skills
* Guild Exp via tax. Stat 100 is required for max skills.

Tasting skill level can only be achieved by tasting the corresponding
number of various spirits (soft / alco <= 3) in a way somewhat similar
to adaptability training of the Mercenaries.

Appendix: Further enhancements
* Spice and flavor the drinks with herbs and fruit
