The Leprechauns - Race Guild for gnomes and dwarves

1. General

The Leprechauns are a race guild for gnomes and dwarves. They are
cobblers who are also a bit luckier than others.

2. Location

An island shared between gnomes and dwarves - between two small
villages.

3. Cobblery

If a leprechaun has a 'leather' item in his or her inventory, they can
make a pair of shoes out of it. The resulting shoes can be worn on
A_FEET, sold to stores or given to other players. The better shoes
last longer. Cobblery can be trained.

4. Luck

Leprechauns can 'search here for coins' in any room. The more
experienced members can find the coins more frequently. In addition
the evasion in combat is aided slightly. Luck cannot be trained.

5. Join/Leave

Any gnome or dwarf, regardless of alignment or allegiance can
join. The guild item is a wearable loose green vest. The leaving can
cause an unlucky event, but not death.
