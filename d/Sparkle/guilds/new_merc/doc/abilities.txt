                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special Attacks: 

    The training yard offers the <mattack> ability via knowledge
    of "mercenary tactics" which can be trained to superior guru. This
    special attack takes into account any weapon that the Mercenary
    might be wielding (or unarmed combat should none be in hand.) There
    is a very small chance that the attack will result in a critical
    hit which yields triple damage.

Adaptability:

    Mercenaries get skill points to allocate however they choose.
    Detailed information on the <adapt> ability and the guru quest
    that accompanies it can be had with <merchelp adapt>.

Affiliation:

    Mercenaries can hire themselves out to whomever they like, shifting
    loyalties with each job they choose to take. To declare loyalty to
    a particular person or guild, the <maffiliate> command can be used
    which will establish the affiliation and reflect in the titles of
    the Mercenary.
