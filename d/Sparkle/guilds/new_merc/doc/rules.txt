    The Free Mercenary Guild is exactly as it sounds. There are no rules
    here. Each man or woman exists for the single common purpose of
    representing the age-old profession of expertise for hire. Mercenaries
    come and go as they please, serving whichever cause they feel is the
    most advantageous for their interests.

    Mercenaries may often be at war with one another depending on which
    causes they are currently serving. If there is any structure or
    order within the guild, it is entirely up to the active members to
    devise and oversee.
