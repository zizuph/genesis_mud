             FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLAINING THEME AND BALANCE

Statement of Theme:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mercenaries are epitomized by the desire to provide services to the
highest bidder. In that a potential contract can ask for just about
any sort of service, the Mercenary dedicates his or her life to knowing
where to learn how to do just about anything well - the art of
adaptability. Mercenaries, therefore, are competent fighters who
have the ability to specialize in whatever knowledge will further
their ability to get a job done.

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/rooms/wep_train.c

A special note about the all_train.c room: To allow mercenaries who
adapt skills to new levels to not suffer skill decay, this room, which
is not accessible to actually enter, provides the mercenary players
with training in every single mudlib-defined skill to a potential of
100. The sk_query_max return for each skill is based on the amount
to which they have adapted the skill via their Mercenary abilities.
This will be described in full below under the section on Adaptability. 

Unique Features and Abilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Adaptability:

        The main distinguishing factor of the Mercenary Guild that is
        meant to appeal to players is that as a Mercenary you become
        an absolute master of the mudlib-defined skills in Genesis.

        Mercenaries get adaptability points (AP) that are equal in
        number to their training level in the "adaptability" skill
        that is offered by the guild. AP can then be "spent" to increase
        any mudlib-defined skill in the game by one level per AP spent.

        The way this is handled technically is that when an AP is spent,
        set_skill_extra() is called in the player for the skill they
        wish to train, which raises their skill in that by one for
        the duration of the login. In addition, the current number of
        AP they are dedicating to that skill is saved in a data file
        that is called upon to set the skills when the player logs
        in for a new session.

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/obj/merc_master.c
        set_skill_enhance()
  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/occ_shadow.c
        init_guild_member()

        Mercenaries receive a potential 100 AP, allowing them to boost
        skills as they desire up to 100 skill points. Upon first
        joining the guild, the player has no AP, and only by raising
        their "adaptability" skill will they gain them - one for each
        skill level they have trained in adaptability.

        However, new Mercenaries limited in the number of levels they
        are able to train adaptability. The actual number is determined
        as 100 - n, where n is the number of mudlib-defined skills
        currently in the game. At the time of this writing there are 48
        such skills, which means that Mercenaries begin being able to
        train adaptability to junior craftsman (52.)

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/rooms/adapt_train.c
        query_sk_max()
  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/obj/merc_master.c
        query_skillnum_index()

        To raise their ability to train to higher levels in adaptability,
        the Mercenary Guild has a very unique guru quest. The idea
        is that for each mudlib skill, there exists somewhere in the
        realms of Genesis an npc who is the "master trainer" for the
        art of that particular lore.

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/obj/merc_master.c
        Adapt_Map (global mapping variable defined at top of file)

        The player can ask the npc trainer of the guild about any
        skill, and the player will then be told who the master trainer
        npc is, and where to look for them. 

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/npc/adapt_trainer.c

        A player must then seek out this npc, and train with them. It
        costs the player 10 platinum coins to begin training with each
        individual master npc. Each time they pay this initial cost with
        a trainer they have not previously visited, they raise the
        level they are able to train adaptability by 1, and thus gain
        an additional AP. In this way, by finding all of the master
        trainer npcs and training with them, the player completes the
        guru quest and is able to train adapatability to superior
        guru, and gets their full compliment of 100 AP. At the time
        of this writing, the cost to complete the guru quest is
        480 platinum coins (n * 10, where n is the number of mudlib-
        defined skills in the game - currently 48.)

        The way this is handled technically is that the code for
        interacting with each npc is contained in the mercenary guild
        master object itself, and then scripts are delivered to the
        npcs to perform using command(). 

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/cmdsoul.c
        adapt()
        mercpay()
  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/obj/merc_master.c
        adapt_script1()
        adapt_cost()
        adapt_train1()
        merc_pay1()

        Mercenaries can re-spec their adaptation choices any time
        they like. But they will always be required to return to the
        master trainer npc for the skill in question to actually
        raise levels back up that they have cleared from their
        AP allocations. The cost for re-training a previously
        adapted skill is only 2 platinum coins.

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/cmdsoul.c
        adapt()  ... see the parts for arg == "clear"
  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/obj/merc_master.c
        clear_adapt()


    - Affiliations:

        Mercenaries, by definition, are blades for hire. To support
        this idea in terms of roleplay, Mercenaries are able to
        affiliate with any guild or player in the game. Doing so will
        change the title of the Mercenary from reading "Free Agent"
        to a either set title that is specific to each guild or
        a title indicating loyalty to the specific player.

        There is no restriction or prerequisite for affiliating with
        a person or group. I can wear a "Brad Pitt is my
        VERY BEST FRIEND!!" T-shirt, Brad Pitt can't do anything
        about it other than come over and punch me in the face. In
        much the same way, a Mercenary can claim affiliation with
        whoever they choose, and the person or group in question
        can then either agree with this idea or come and punch the
        Mercenary in the face, Genesis-style.

  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/cmdsoul.c
        maffiliate()
  * /d/Sparkle/guilds/new_merc/obj/merc_master.c
        parse_affiliation()



Combat Specials:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Mattack:

        Using Mercenary Tactics, a mercenary looks for an opportunity
        in combat to achieve this special attack. This is a fairly
        mundane run-of-the-mill attack that provides fairly standard
        descriptions based on the type of weapon used.

        The attack is distinctive in that it provides one of the
        (if not the very) shortest prep times and recovery times of
        any special attack in the game. The prep and recovery time
        are each 4-8 seconds depending on the Mercenary Tactics skill
        of the player. With a combat aid set at 70, this attack
        becomes a high-frequency low-yield special. To players, it is
        likely to seem slightly underpowered, which given the
        other skill-based benefits of this game is keeping with the
        design goals. This is not meant to be a guild on par with
        gladiators or knights for combat unless the Mercenary very
        specifically optimizes for that purpose and that purpose
        alone.

        One unique aspect of this special is that there is a 1/1000
        chance that any given hit will be considered a critical hit.
        A critical hit results in x3 damage and very colorful
        combat messages.

Final Thoughts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A potentially very meaningful aspect of balance for the Mercenary Guild
will play out in the way individual players are able to use the skill
boosting advantages to amplify the powers of their layman guilds. Special
monitoring should be given to thieves who make use of the <backstab>
attack and spellcasters whose spell effects take skill levels into
account.

Many thanks to all who have been involved in the process of creation and
testing!
