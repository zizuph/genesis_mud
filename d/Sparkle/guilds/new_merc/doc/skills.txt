                                   Skills:
                                   ~~~~~~~ 

    Mercenaries pride themselves on competence in all forms of combat
    ability. Therefore, they receive training to confident veteran
    in each of the following skills:

                    club                   defence
                    sword                  two handed combat
                    axe                    parry
                    polearm                

    Mercenaries deem the knife, and the martial art combat forms
    as slightly less important, thus training only to superior
    professional in:

                    knife
                    blindfighting
                    unarmed combat         

    Skill is also trained in Mercenary Tactics, which is detailed in
    <merchelp abilities>. 

    By far, the most important skill of any Mercenary is that of
    Adaptability, which can be learned from Mellok in the Training Yard.
