                 The Free Mercenary Guild of Sparkle
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                       ( a brief history ... )

Though lone mercenaries have always been known to drift in and out of
Sparkle, it was not recorded in the logs of the City Councel that they
were any sort of organized force until the mercenary known as Maligant
arrived. An expatriot of the then disbanded Army of Angmar from the
distant lands of Middle Earth, Maligant brought the knowledge he had
gained as a soldier of the Angmarim to bear with those that joined him
and his newly established band in the areas northwest of Sparkle City
at the Mercenary Camp.

For many years, Maligant trained like-minded soldiers for hire in the
arts of the effective Mercenary, with special emphasis on the skills he
himself had known in the service of Angmar - specifically, the tactics
of the shield and single-handed weaponry. The Mercenaries came to be
known as an established guild worthy of respect from friends and foes
alike.

When news first reached the Mercenary Camp that the Army of Angmar had
been reestablished in Middle Earth, reports are that Maligant went into
his tent and did not emerge for three days. When he was next seen by
his fellow Mercenaries, he said little, but had a distant gleam in
his eye as he left the camp with what appeared to be all he could
carry. Word from relations in Middle Earth say he has been seen
a few times in the Misty Mountains, gathered with orcs and other
forces of the Angmarim.

Attempts were made by numerous of the Mercenaries to maintain the
order and discipline that Maligant had brought to the guild, yet none
with much success. After a period of just a few weeks, it looked as
if the Mercenary band might dissolve entirely, were it not for the
orc raid.

It was in the middle of the night when a desperate horseman rode into
the Mercenary camp from the City of Sparkle, crying out to all who
could hear him about the attack on the city be orcs from the west.
The City Council had sent the man with the authority to offer the
Mercenaries a great sum of money and more if they would come to the
aid of the city in this time of dread. The Mercenaries, always ready
to jump for the right price, mustered their available members and
aided the City guards in overthrowing the assaulting orcish raiders
and driving them from the area.

So grateful was the City Council that they offered the Mercenary Guild
lodging in one of the former luxury housing complexes situated within
the city. Finding this a welcome reprieve from the rough conditions
at camp, the Mercenaries soon had moved their entire operation to
within the City of Sparkle itself, having drawn up an agreement from
the local authorities that such an arrangement would be mutually
beneficial.

In return for acting as a standing militia for the safety of the City,
the Mercenary guild was given free housing and even board from certain
grateful townsfolk who were glad to provide them with a free
meal once a day. They soon had converted the housing complex into
a versatile compound capable of providing lodging for the various
factions that existed within their own membership as well as training
facilities within the large courtyard that was nested between the
surrounding structures of the facility.

As time passed, the arrangement proved successful, and the Mercenary 
Guild came to flourish with new members and a new and newfound esteem
from the townsfolk. Even so, the guild grew less and less like the old
war machine that had functioned under Maligant's firm guidance. Without
a leader, the guild became more and more factioned, each member finding
their own means for loyalty and fortune. Eventually, the guild came
to be known for its ability to provide the fundamentals of all aspects
of combat to its members, yet lacked the ability to teach mastery
of any one thing. With individual mercenaries affiliating with various
outside influences and guilds, the members became known for their
ability to adapt themselves to any situation they found themselves
in, honing their skills as needed to the employer they were currently
serving.

And thus the guild remains to this day - A chief offering for those
adventurers in the land who would choose their master from among the
various peoples of the realms, or, better yet, have no master but
themselves - true exemplars of this, the Free Mercenary Guild of
Sparkle!
