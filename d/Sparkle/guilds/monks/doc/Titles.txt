[Title Composition]---------------------------------------------------------

The title consists of one or two base parts augmented with adjectives.

The base part can be one of:

 - Monk (rank based, from Novice to Monk)
 - Dancer (rank based, from Fledgling to Dancer)
 - Guardian (stats based, just Guardian or Nexus)
 - Heart (character based, long description)
 - Elder (user selected)
 - Council (user selected)
 - Brother (user selected)

The adjectives can be one of:

 - Ancient (rank based, from Fresh to Ancient)
 - Hallowed (character based, short adjective)
 - Resplendent (alignment based, from Stygian to Resplendent)

The allowed combinations of base parts and adjectives are:

 - Monk, Ancient Monk, Hallowed Monk, Resplendent Monk
 - Dancer, Hallowed Dancer, Resplendent Dancer
 - Guardian, Hallowed Guardian, Resplendent Guardian
 - Heart
 - Elder, Hallowed Elder, Resplendent Elder
 - Council, Hallowed Council, Resplendent Council
 - Brother, Hallowed Brother, Resplendent Brother

The combinations are further restricted by rank:

 - Tiny rank - Must have a title in two parts
             - Must have a rank indication in the title
             - Must have a character indication in the title
 - Small rank - Does not need a rank indication in the title
 - Medium rank - Does not need a character indication in the title
 - Advanced rank - Does not need a title in two parts
 - High rank - Can also choose specific Monk, Dancer, Guardian
 - Top rank - Can also choose specific Brother
            - Can use Monk without adjective

This gives the following command syntax:

  - mtitle <adjective>, <base> [, <adjective>, <base>]
  - adjective is one of none, ancient, hallowed, resplendent
  - base is one of monk, heart, dancer
  - base can be a specific title if that title is available for that player

[Notes]..........................................................

Things that can be reflected in the title:

 - Alignment
 - Guild level
 - Guild position
 - Pending punishments
 - Predominant character traits
 - Top level in specific stat
 - Top level in specific character trait
 - Top level in number of dragons claimed kin

Title length can be adjusted to cater both for people who want to be Foo the
Monk and for people who want to be Bar the Most Exalted and Wise and Of
Course Humble Priest of the Inner Circle and Very Good Monk.

Character traits are:

 - Perfection
 - Honesty
 - Effort
 - Respect
 - Peacefulness

I would prefer to have the top titles short and elegant rather than long and
cumbersome, that is, one would not advance towards longer and longer titles
but towards simplicity. I think the titles do not necessarily have to refer
to everyone as a monk or a priest, Foo the Seeker of the Spring Path or Bar
the Sage of the Frozen Waterfall sounds better to me than Foo the Mildly
Advanced Monk Student and Bar the Very Wise Monk Teacher.
