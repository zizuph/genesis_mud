The catacombs are a place of arcane beauty, visible only to monks and of those,
more to the monks that met more of their kin. Originally, the cave where the
catacombs reside was made by dragons, the first occupants of the Dragon
Mountains. Although the purpose is now forgotten, the setting suggests a meeting
hall of sorts, with perches arranged in concentric circles around a dais.

Now, the dragons are naturally long gone, but the essence of the dragon life
force still permeates the area. This helped the ancient priests remake the cave
into a shrine, one that celebrates the variety of the dragons. Each perch is now
dedicated to a specific dragon that is present elsewhere in the realms, but only
those monks who met the dragon and claimed him as kin will feel his presence on
the perch.

The perches are connected by rope bridges, both tangentially and radially, but
not all bridges can be walked by all players. The radial bridges leading towards
the center of the shrine do not start directly at each perch, but some way
downwards along its base column, and the material of the column is too slippery
to climb for all except those who are favored by the dragon whose perch they are
climbing.

A player is favored by a dragon if he is a monk who claimed the dragon as kin
and if the sequential number of the dragon on the given concentric circle is a
residue of dividing the name_to_random of the player and the circle by the
number of dragons in that circle, or the same holds for a dragon with a
sequential number half the size of the circle higher. This way, each player has
a unique path to follow to the dais in the center of the shrine, but each player
also has a choice of two dragons to befriend and thus does not get stuck in case
he does not know one of them.

For an added effect, a player who claimed all dragons as kin climbs everywhere.
