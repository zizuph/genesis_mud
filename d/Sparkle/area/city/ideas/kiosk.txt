I'd like to have a kiosk prominently located in town that lists things
for people to do in the city:

    - Help fight the rodent menace in the sewers! Interested parties should
      report to the magistrate for more information.

    - Street sweepers needed. Help keep Sparkle clean and beautiful for
      visitors and citizens alike. See the port authority for details.

    - The Travelling Merchants will be setting up their wares each week
      in Market Square. Be sure to visit the city each Wednesday to see
      what they can offer you!

    - Upcoming music concert: Don't miss this opportunity to hear the
      finest musicians in the land play for your delight. They will be
      performing each Saturday - time TBA.

etc ... etc ...

Sparkle will be cool!
G.
