(this was Petros' idea)

And just as I send out my mail, I come up with another idea
that I think would be really cool. Tracking! So let's say
someone's pet keep running away, and you need to use real
tracking to find them. This would train them for more
stealthy guilds like Rangers, while making it an easy
repeatable quest in the tutorial.
