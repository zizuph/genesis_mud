                    TELBERIN SEWERS - AN OVERVIEW

The basic concept here is to create a good, old-fashioned dungeon
crawl reminiscent of your typical Bard's Tale or Might and Magic
type D&D computer game. There are 4 levels to the sewers, and things
become more dire as you progress lower, closer to where the Necromancer
is working his dark arts.

The basic premise is that a very gifted elf mage has been driven mad
by his contacts with Val Shoreil, and holed himself up in the bottom
of the Sewers, intent on raising an undead army to do his bidding. He
has filled the sewers with his experiments, starting with rats and
other beasts on the first level, skeletons and undead elves on the
second level, and fearsome undead entities on the third. His champion,
the Reaver, guards the entrace to his study.

If you are able to defeat the Necromancer, you can complete a quest
which the Apothecary has alluded to. He and the Necromancer were former
friends in the Mage Guild, and went into business together selling
potions. However, once the Necromancer was seduced by the dark gifts
of Val Shoreil, he ran off with the Apothecariate, a tome of vast
knowledge on potions and spells that the two had researched and penned
together while friends. The Apothecary will teach the player an
enchantment that teleports the book back to the Apothecarium.

If the player is able to kill the Necromancer, and return the book to
the Apothecarium, the quest is flipped, and the ghost of the Necromancer
is now the Questmaster. He hovers over his bones, and offers players
a reward, should they be able to teleport the book from the Apothecarium
down to him, and then take his bones and resurrect him, using a Cauldron
and knowledge from the Apothecariate. This quest toggle will operate
somewhat like the Dwarfgate quest in Krynn - either the light or dark
side is available at any time, never both.

                                   can solve the Apothecary's quest by
