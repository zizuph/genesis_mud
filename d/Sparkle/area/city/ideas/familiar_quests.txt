Nome had these ideas for quests given by a familiar that will follow newbies
around and help them. The idea was that the familiar is different based on
what race you are (i.e. gnomes get a mechanical chicken or somesuch, and
orcs get a swamp hog. Whatever ...)

Simple List:
Item collection: Buy a rod and fish! fish for xp and sell for coin.
                 Simple herb collection: Nome the Alchemist needs Xherb. Reward
                 for supply.
                 Booooooze: Nome the Bartender needs someone to run booze from
                 Dwarfheim to Sparkle Major.

Message Delivery: If the waifs of Avenir can do it, why not newbies?
                  Nome the fisherman needs to send a letter to Haderach the
                  lumberjack.
                  Can be repeated with different sets of NPCs.

Newbie Explorer Quest: Familiar offers reward if the newbie can find a spot
                       with a "x."
                       "Lets go find a cave!" "Find me an ogre-mage!" ect.

Random: Some games have rewards for completing certain...feats (for lack of a
        better word)
        Get rewarded for killing one foe with every weapon type (sword, axe...)
        Get reward for finding 20 different herbs.
        Ect.
