This document contains information that can assist with building consistent
design into our piecemeal creation of the ever-evolving city of Sparkle -
Hub of Genesis.

ORIGINS:
~~~~~~~

When the donut cooled and the Pen Sea congealed from the remaining grease,
one of the first outposts that was established along the coasts was Sparkle.
Even in these early times, it was distinguished primarily as a port of call,
offering safe passage via ship to the various lands that were being explored
by brave travellers, merchants, and adventurers. This has been the primary
legacy of Sparkle as it has evolved over the many year - a community built
around commerce and the comings and goings of people from lands far and
wide.

The original Sparkle was quite humble. At that time, very few of the lands
that now are known to exist had been discovered. As such, the community
that had sprung up to support and benefit from the ports was little more
than a rough-and-tumble society that could take care of themselves and
handle the constant traffic in their town. The flavor of this period was
perhaps akin to the wild-west in RL terms, or perhaps the communities that
sprung up around the buccaneers in the days of Captain Morgan.

Most of the structures in town were small and rugged. Two, however, were
much grander in scale - the First Church of Sparkle and the Tower of Realms.
A mystical heritage occupies both of these spaces. The Tower of Realms was
commissioned and constructed by the mighty wizards to act as an information
center to the mortals who wished to know what transpired in the halls of
the Immortals. The First Church had always been known as a place of
beginnings, healing, and renewal for those who had met with death.


DEVELOPING TIMES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the knowledge of the far lands grew, so did the city. New offices and
facilities were created for various purposes. These have included the
donations office, the MVSEVM, and many additional shipping lines. The
city has grown radially, always moving outward from the "Old City" which
eventually graduated from a fortified outpost to a bona-fide city complete
with protective walls.

MODERN ERA:
~~~~~~~~~~

The modern era was launched by a single event: the surprise monopolization
of the shipping lines by an entity which sprang up known as the GSL -
The Genesis Shipping Lines. This organization was comprised of
representatives of the city who wished to re-establish Sparkle as the 
primary hub of activity and commerce for the donut. As such, using
various methods (including extortion, high salaries, and the like) they
were able to convince ship captains to cancel all between-domain travel,
routing instead through Sparkle first.

Since this shift, the town has begun to emerge as one of the premier
cities in the lands. New enterprises and merchants are flocking to the
city to get a piece of the action. The community organizers have begun to
feel that for Sparkle to compete with the other cities, it will need to
begin offering similar cultural experiences. It was for this reason that
one of the first major buildings of the modern times to be erected was
the Great Library of Sparkle, which is meant to eventually function as
the finest repository of knowledge in Genesis (or so the people of
Sparkle hope.)

The town continues to grow, and as it does, new people, businesses,
facilities, and places of interest will continue to evolve.

AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike some cities in the realms which represent a consistent culture or
kingdom (Minas Tirith, Sybarus, Sanction, etc) Sparkle has always been
an ecclectic outgrowth of the people who visit it and the merchants who
support their needs. All races, all alignments, all factions have found
a foothold of some kind in the city, making it a patchwork of many things.

When building new areas in Sparkle, we use Styles' map as an inspiration,
but not as a limitation. The idea of old vs. new is one of the few real
distinctions that exists in the plan. We try to maintain the idea that
some of the areas of town are original carryovers from the old fortified
port community. The new things can spring up as anything that we feel
would represent a specific faction or interest.

GOALS:
~~~~~

Sparkle, primarily, is a working-city. There are many places in the game
to go for a wonderful feeling of immersion, cultural experience, and
storytelling. This will not be Sparkle's legacy or function. Rather,
Sparkle is a place where players come to participate in various dynamic
experiences that we will offer. It is meant to be the "Hub" of the game
in terms of activity.

A secondary function of Sparkle will need to be its utility to new players.
It will need to be completely newbie friendly in all respects, offering
easy-to-understand content and helpful information as to how to progress
into other areas of the game. Moreover, it will need to offer many many
newbie-friendly quests.

The "Order of the Pearl" quest describes an over-arching theme for the
town that has built up around some of the old families and interests that
knit the place together. See:

    /d/Sparkle/area/city/doc/Sparkle_Factions_Quest.txt

Also, we want the city to be a many-layered place, offering interesting
tactical options for various playstyles. This includes a rooftop layer and
a sewer layer to the town (all buildings should connect to all layers.)

Npcs in the city should know one another, know the city, and know what is
going on. They should also have daily schedules of things they do at
certain times. See:

    /d/Sparkle/area/city/library/npc/nikolon.c

The city should, as much as possible, offer players things to do, and reasons
to come beyond simply being funnelled through thanks to the GSL. The
Auction House and the Wednesday Market are some early examples of these
things to do. Sparkle needs many more. As much as we can create event-like
or progressive (especially competetive) opportunities for players to
"work on things" the better. (i.e. crafting!)
