Sparkle Considerations:

 - Consistent descriptions of geography
 - Consistent descriptions of city layout
 - Consistent implementation of city features:
    - Architecture
    - Street signs (with names of streets)
 - Sewers beneath the city
 - Rooftops for all buildings accessible to certain players
 - Npc features
    - All have names and introduce
    - All respond to questions on
        - Other city npcs
        - Genesis
        - Sparkle City
        - Surrounding region
        - Other domains
 - Quests
    - One newbie quest for each major city location (inn, arms, etc)
    - One major quest that encorporates elements from all over the city
 - Create a dynamic situation for anti-combat status
    - The city militia patrols the place, keeping it a no-combat zone
    - If the militia are called away (fighting trolls, etc) then the
      town becomes open to pvp.
    - The militia is in town all but the first week of every month
      (or somesuch)
