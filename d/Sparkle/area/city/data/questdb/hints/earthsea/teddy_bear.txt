You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in the attic of a house in Gont. You see a dimpled girl sitting in her bed crying out for her mother. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
