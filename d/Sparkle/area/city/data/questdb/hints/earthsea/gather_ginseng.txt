You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a husky herb shop on the small island of Thwil. You see an energetic apprentice of the Wizard's School working in the store. He pauses and frowns slightly, looking at the shelves. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
