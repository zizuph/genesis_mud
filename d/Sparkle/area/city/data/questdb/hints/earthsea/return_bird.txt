You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a secluded area of a garden in Ten Alders. You see a baby bird on the ground beneath a large tree crying out with pathetic little chirps. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
