You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a kitchen in a house in Ten Alders. You see a motherly woman admiring her collection of seashells. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
