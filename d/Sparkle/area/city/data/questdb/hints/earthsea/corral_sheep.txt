You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive just south of a paddock on the small island of Thwil. You see a sad adolescent boy who appears to be in charge of some sheep. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
