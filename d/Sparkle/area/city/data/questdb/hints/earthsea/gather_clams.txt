You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a small but comfortable room in a house in Gont. You see a dark-eyed woman who is cooking dinner. She pauses and frowns slightly at the recipe she is following. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
