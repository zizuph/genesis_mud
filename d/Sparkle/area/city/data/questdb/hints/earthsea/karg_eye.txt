You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a vast domed cave. You see a beautiful kargish woman who stands next to a huge stone statue. You notice that the statue is missing one eye. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
