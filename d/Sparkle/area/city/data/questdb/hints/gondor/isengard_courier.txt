You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. A vision of a courier running from Isengard swims before your eyes. As he pauses to look across the plains of Rohan, your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
