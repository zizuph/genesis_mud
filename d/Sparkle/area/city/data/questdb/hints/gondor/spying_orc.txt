You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself on the walls of Helm's Deep. You see two guards patrolling the walls. One of them suddenly stops up and calls out, "Something moving at the base of the wall! Come quickly!" Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
