You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the midst of a Haradrim camp south of Poros. You see the Haradrim War Chief pacing around the room, bitterly casting a look of suspicion out at his camp. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk,
instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
