You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself by the white bridge in Morgul Vale. You see a small gap in a nearby wall that looks like a long forgotten passage. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
