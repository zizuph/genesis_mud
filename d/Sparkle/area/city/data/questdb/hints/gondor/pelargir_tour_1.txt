You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the office of the Lord Councilor of Pelargir. On a table, you notice a list of chores that are planned for the day. You begin reading something about a report from one of the ship captains and then your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
