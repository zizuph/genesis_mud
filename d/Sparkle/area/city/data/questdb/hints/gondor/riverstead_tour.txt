You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the small village of Riverstead where townsfolk are quickly running past you, and you hear distant screams! Someone shouts, "We must get word to Pelargir!" just as your vision blurs, and you return to your body with a jerk,
instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
