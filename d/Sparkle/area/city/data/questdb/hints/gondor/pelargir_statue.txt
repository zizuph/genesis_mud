You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the study and library of a mansion in Pelargir. You see an elderly man who is searching through his bookshelves obviously searching for something. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
