You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the Sleeping Stallion, the local inn of Edoras. You see an aged gray-haired man drinking away his sorrows muttering about something he has lost. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
