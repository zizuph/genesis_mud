You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a barren harbor-area in the southern parts of Pelennor in Gondor. You see a slim sneaky human being literally thrown out the gates by a guardsman. Bitterly, he peers back at the now closed gates, and looks around, considering his options. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
