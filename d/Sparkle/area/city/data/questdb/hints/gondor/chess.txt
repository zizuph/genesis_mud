You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the pub of the Rockfriend guild west of Hobbiton in the Shire. You see a couple of old dwarves and a chessboard. Just as they beckon you to play, your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
