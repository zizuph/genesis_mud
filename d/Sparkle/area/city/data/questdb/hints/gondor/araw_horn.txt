You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the office of the Minas Tirith Master of Advice. You see the advisor to the Steward; he is looking at an empty holster which appears to be fit to hold a hunting horn. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
