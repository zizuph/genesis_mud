You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself high in the peaks of the White Mountains southeast of Edoras. A loud cry sounds out, and you notice a desperate mother Eagle peering into her empty nest. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
