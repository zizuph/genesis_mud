You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Two individuals, both surrounded by armour, appear before your eyes. One is in Minas Tirith, and the other in Minas Morgul. Simultaneously, they both reach for their can of paint only to find it nearly empty. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
