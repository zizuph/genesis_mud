You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself inside a cairn in the Barrow Downs. You see some engraved words on a stone door that are hard to read. A terror wells up within you, and before you know what is happening, your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
