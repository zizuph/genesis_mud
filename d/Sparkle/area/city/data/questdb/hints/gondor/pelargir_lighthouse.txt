You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the lantern room of the lighthouse in Pelargir. You see the Lighthouse Keeper who is yelling out the window at some hooligans who are running away. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
