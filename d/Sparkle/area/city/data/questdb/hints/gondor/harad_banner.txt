You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing in a white walled hall in the middle of the Rangers Camp in Gondor. You see one of the elderly Rangers who appears to be studying a parchment, and muttering to himself about an important task that needs attending to. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
