You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a tall tree in the east part of Ithilien Forest. You see two lookouts peering out across the land below. Their stomachs are growling, it has probably been a while since they ate. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
