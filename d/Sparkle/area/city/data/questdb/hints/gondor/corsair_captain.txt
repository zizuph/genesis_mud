You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in an office inside the ruins of an old manor house. You see the leader of the Black Numenorean talking to some of his corsairs. He appears to be looking for a courier that dares venture beyond the black gate. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
