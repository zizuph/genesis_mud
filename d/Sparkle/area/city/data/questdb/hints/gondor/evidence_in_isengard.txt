You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself on a road near Edoras. You see a flaxen-haired man of Rohan - a look of deep concern etched on his face. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
