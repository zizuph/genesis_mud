You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the office of Elfhelm, the Marshal of the King's Eored of the riders of Rohan. He is studying a map on the wall, and muttering to himself about the immenent dangers to his people. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
