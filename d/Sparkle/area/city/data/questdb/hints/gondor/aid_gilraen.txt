You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the entry hall of the house with pale stone walls inside of Mithas Tirith. You see a woman talking to herself as she rocks back and forth in her rocking chair. She appears to be extremely preoccupied with something, but seems to suddenly notice you. Just as she turns to you with an imploring look in her eyes your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
