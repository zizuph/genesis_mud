You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the Stables of Minas Tirith. Nearby, the Stable Master is peering into the feedbag of some of the finest stallions of the Guard, and muttering about inadequate provisions. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
