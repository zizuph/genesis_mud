You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Odd visions swim before your eyes. A forsaken town deep in the south of Ithilien in Gondor ... a battle standard hidden beyond a powerful enchantment ... a solemn array of statues. Suddenly the visions shift, and you see two individuals at the same time. One - Hunthor the Master of Advice in the City of Minas Tirith. The second - the Warden of the Tower of Dark Sorcery in Minas Morgul. Both turn to look upon you, and just as you begin to sense an urgency, your vision blurs, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
