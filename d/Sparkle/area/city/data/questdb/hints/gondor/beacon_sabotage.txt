You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a chamber within the Tower in Minas Morgul. An ominous warden paces back and forth, and you hear dark mutterings about a job that needs doing. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
