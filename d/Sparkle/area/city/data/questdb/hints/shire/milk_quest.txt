You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a meadow south of Greenholm in the Shire. You see an old hobbit with his premium cow. The cow appears to be long overdue for milking. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
