You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a quaint little cottage in the Shire. You see an old woman looking very worried muttering to herself about how dangerous the world is becoming. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
