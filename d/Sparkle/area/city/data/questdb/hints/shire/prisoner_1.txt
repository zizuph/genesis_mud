You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a big hall inside the goblin tunnels under the Misty Mountains. You see a huge goblin tossing a key up and down in his hand while announcing to himself: Elf Soup, My favorite! Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
