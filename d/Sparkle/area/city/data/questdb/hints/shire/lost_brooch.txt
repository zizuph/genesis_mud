You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the middle of Rivendell. You see a sad elf sulking, and mumbling about something that has been lost. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
