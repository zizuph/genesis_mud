You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a prison cell inside the goblin tunnels under the Misty Mountains. You see an elf trying to fight his way through the tunnels. Alone, and unaided, it appears as if his efforts will be in vain. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
