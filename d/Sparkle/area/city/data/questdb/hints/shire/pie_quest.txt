You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the Mayor's office in Michel Delving. The mayor is leaning back in his chair, licking the last bits of filling off an old pie plate. He appears more absorbed in this task than in any of the other work in front of him. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
