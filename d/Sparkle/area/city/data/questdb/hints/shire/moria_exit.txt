You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a dark tunnel in Moria, drums echoing loudly in the distance. A sign on the ground covered in strange rune markings catches your attention. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
