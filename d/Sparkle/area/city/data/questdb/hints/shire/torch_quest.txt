You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a dead end in the goblin tunnels under the Misty Mountains. You see a torch salesman who, from the looks of it, appears to be doing very well for himself. Unfortunately he appears to be running low on torches. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
