You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you see two alternatives. 

The first alternative is a black tent in the midst of an orc camp in the Shire. There is a black-robed man who appears very agitated about something or someone. 

The second alternative is in the hidden valley of Rivendell. An elf living there seems upset about a missing heirloom.

Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
