You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a prison cell inside the goblin tunnels under the Misty Mountains. You see a starving elf prisoner in this cell. It doesn't seem like he will last long without food and drink. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
