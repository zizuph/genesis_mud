You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself on a path in the village of Greenholm in the Shire. You see a young hobbit who is crying, and wandering around. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
