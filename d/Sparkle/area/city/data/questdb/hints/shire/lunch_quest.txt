You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself near Bree in the Shire. You see an old woman running around in frenzy with a lunch bag in her hand while calling for her husband. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
