You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the open air along the steep slopes of the Misty Mountains. A man is here, repeatedly attempting to climb an immense rock face, and failing miserably. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
