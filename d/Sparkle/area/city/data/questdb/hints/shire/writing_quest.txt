You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the middle of Rivendell. You see an old hobbit writing in a book. He suddenly stops and peers annoyedly at his writing implements. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
