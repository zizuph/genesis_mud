You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a prison cell inside the goblin tunnels under the Misty Mountains. You see an elf prisoner who appears to be steeling himself for some type of action. He looks rather forlorn, like he probably wont stand much of a chance without help. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
