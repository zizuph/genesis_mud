You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing in the front hall of a very small smial in the Shire. You see a troubled hobbit who is working on a sketch what appears to be a map. Looking up from his work, he sighs bitterly. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
