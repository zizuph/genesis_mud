You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself under the Bridge of Stonebows by the Brandywine River. You see a tired man relaxing while fishing in the river. Unfortunately he appears to be out of bait. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk,
instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
