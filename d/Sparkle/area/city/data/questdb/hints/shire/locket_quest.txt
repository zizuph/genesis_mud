You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a small shack on top of the Hill in Bree. You see a babbling human cursing loudly. He sounds as if he has lost something of importance. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
