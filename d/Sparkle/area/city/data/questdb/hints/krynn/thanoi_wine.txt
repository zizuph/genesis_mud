You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a stone corridor filled with thanoi. You see the thanoi gruffly grab some wine from a rickety winerack and begin enjoying themselves. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
