You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself at a forge where the ice folk villagers are creating mysterious icy weapons. You see a wise man standing next to the forge, preaching to all who would listen of the fabled polar bear and its merits. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
