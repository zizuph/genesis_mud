You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in Tarshir's House, the Quest Master of Solace. Tarshir looks up from his work, and smiles at you. He says: "Congratulations Seeker, you have finished all of the tours that I had for you. Now I will begin giving you tasks that are a bit more challenging, but not yet dangerous. Let us see if you can prove yourself to me again by completing the first one. Come seek me out and I shall give you more information." Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
