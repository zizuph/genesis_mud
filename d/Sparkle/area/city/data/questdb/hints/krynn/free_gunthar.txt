You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself just outside of Vingaard Keep. You see a noble knight of the Rose order being tied up and dragged away by soldiers of the Blue Dragonarmy, led by a female Highlord. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
