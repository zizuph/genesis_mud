You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself at a forge in the old dwarven caverns southeast of Palanthas. You see some broken hollow blocks lying next to the large forge - a clear sign that someone was forging here recently. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
