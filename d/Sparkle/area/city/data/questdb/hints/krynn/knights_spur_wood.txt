You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a kitchen inside the Knight's Spur near the Vingaard Mountains. You see a thick-waisted woman who is stirring a pot hanging over the fire. She pauses and looks annoyedly at the feeble flames beneath the pot. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
