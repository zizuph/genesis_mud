You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in Tarshir's House, the Quest Master of Solace. You see Tarshir step over to a large box marked 'Tourist Cards' and begin flipping through them. He draws one out, reads it, and smiles in your direction. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
