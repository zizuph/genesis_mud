You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the western part of a minotaur fortress west of Solace. The minotaurs here appear a bit shiftless and lacking in high-spirits. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
