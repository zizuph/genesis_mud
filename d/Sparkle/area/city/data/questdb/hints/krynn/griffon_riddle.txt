You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself on a cliff in the Vingaard Mountains. You see a large nest here and some griffon feathers on the ground. Surely there is something here to discover, but you cannot sense more without finding the place yourself. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
