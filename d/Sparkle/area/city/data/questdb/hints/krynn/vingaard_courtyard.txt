You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in Tarshir's House, the Quest Master of Solace. You see the quest master with a pile of tourist tour cards. On the top tour card you read: Visit the courtyard of Vingaard Keep. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
