You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in an old area of the icy forest in Icewall. You see a powerful yeti, and the frozen corpse of an elf. Something about the corpse triggers a feeling of purpose within you. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
