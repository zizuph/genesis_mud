You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in Tarshir's House, the Quest Master of Solace. Tarshir looks up from his work, and smiles at you. He says: "I know of a gnome who could use your help. Seek me out, and learn more." Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
