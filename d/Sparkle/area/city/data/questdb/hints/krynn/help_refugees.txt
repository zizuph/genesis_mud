You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in stone house of the barbarian chieftain in Que Shu. The chieftain paces back and forth, muttering quietly with a look of anger mixed with concern on his face. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
