You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a prison cell inside the Knight's Spur near the Vingaard Mountains. You see a worn down draconian who has clearly suffered many beatings, hunger and thirst. It doesn't look like he would last another night. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
