You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in Icewall inside a very large kitchen cluttered with all sorts of kitchen utensils. You see short woman working on plucking chickens with lightning speed. She has a note on the counter bearing the seal of the Dragon HighLord, which she glances at nervously. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
