You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself near a boat house in the west part of the Solamnian Plains. You see a large vault here with a large lock on it. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
