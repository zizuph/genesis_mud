You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Strangely, you do not see a clear vision, but instead many images swim before your eyes until two distinct places appear side by side. On your left appears a small elven camp somewhere in the forest of Qualinesti. On your right you see a guard room somewhere in Pax Tharkas. In both scenes, you hear intense discussions about an elvish scout, and you get the impression that you could involve yourself at either place, depending on your alignment. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
