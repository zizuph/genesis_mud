You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself a well-furnished office in Vingaard Keep. You see a noble knight sitting in his chair. A squire is in the midst of reporting to the knight rumors of the location of one of the fabled dragonlances. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
