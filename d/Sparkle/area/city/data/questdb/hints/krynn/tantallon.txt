You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in Tarshir's House, the Quest Master of Solace. Tarshir looks up from his work, and smiles at you. He says: "You have recently aided me in picking an apple from the elusive tree in Solace, but your work is not done. I have three more such tasks for you to perform when you have time. I will await your arrival in my office at Solace." Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
