You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in some sort of cave. You see a lonely gnome, surrounded by weird contraptions. It seems to be a workshop of some sort where one might be able to build something, if it's possible to find anything in the complete mess of different components. Outside the room, busy gnomes go about their business. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
