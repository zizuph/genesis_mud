You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a wooden hut located in a forest in the southern part of Mithas. You see a witch dressed in dirty rags sitting in deep thought. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
