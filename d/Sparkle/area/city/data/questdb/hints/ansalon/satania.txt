You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at what you recognize as a cabin on the Golden Lion sailing vessel. You see a silver-haired elf cursing to himself and hear him mumbling something about a renegade mage. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
