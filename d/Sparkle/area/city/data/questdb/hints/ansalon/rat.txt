You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a large tree full of pigeons right outside the Kendermore Post Office. You see the pigeon keeper searching frantically for something. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
