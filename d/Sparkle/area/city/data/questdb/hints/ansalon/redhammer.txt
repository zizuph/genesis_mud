You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at the 'Hawkstones Taproom' the busiest tavern in Flotsam. You see a cheerful dwarf having a heated discussion with the barkeep over something. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
