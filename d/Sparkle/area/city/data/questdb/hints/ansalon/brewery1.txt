You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the Inn of the Last Home in Solace. A drunken dwarf looks up and complains that the export brew on tap is awful. He wants you to go and make something better for him, and the world. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
