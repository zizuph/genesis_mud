You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in an office on a boat on the Bloodsea. You see four pirate captains dividing and each grabbing a piece of a treasure map just as they leave the cabin. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
