You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in an office just outside Flotsam currently occupied by the Knights. You see an elderly man struggling with the heavy burdens he carries on his back. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
