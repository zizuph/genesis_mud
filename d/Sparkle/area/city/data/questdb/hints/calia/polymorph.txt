A voice booms through the Tower Office, speaking to you of an ancient evil residing on the Moorlands. It beseeches you to seek out Gamalus who will judge if you are worthy enough to attempt to take on a demonic foe.  As the voice fades it whispers to be careful as the demon can easily overpower younger adventurers.
