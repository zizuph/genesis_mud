Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing on a narrow path that closely follows along the base of a tall cliff. You see an unlucky old man fishing in the sea of Calia. You see a fish nibble at the bait then move away multiple times. Each time the old man comments that if only he had his lucky lure, he would have caught that fish already.
