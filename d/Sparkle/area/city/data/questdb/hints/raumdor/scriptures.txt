You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a huge chamber filled with paintings and tapestries. You see the Lord of Drakmere with his most loyal guards. They are talking about something of great value that has been lost. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
