You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a beach outside the western border of a shadowy forest in Raumdor. You see a red-robed occultist contemplating some matters. Suddenly he stops, looking around, and mumbles something about a book. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
