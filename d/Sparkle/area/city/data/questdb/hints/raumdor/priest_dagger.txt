You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at an altar inside a morbid temple. You see a priest getting ready to perform some kind of ceremony. Suddenly he stops, looking around, and mutters a curse. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
