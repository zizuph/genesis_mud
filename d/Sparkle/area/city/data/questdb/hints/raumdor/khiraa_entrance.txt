You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in the Forest of Shadows in Raumdor. You see a large skull on the ground opening its mouth as if begging for something. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
