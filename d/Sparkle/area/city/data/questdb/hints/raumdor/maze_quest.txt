You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a small hut inside the city of Drakmere. You see an old man wearing tattered rags who seems to be studying some figures very closely. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
