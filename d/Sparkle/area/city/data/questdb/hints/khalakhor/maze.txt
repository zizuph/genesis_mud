It has long been rumoured in Nyreese that with the knowledge of one's true name, absolute power over the one who's name you know is also incurred. It is said that an old hermit who has hidden himself away in the maze of a forest knows each and every traveller's true name in the Donut. If you can solve the riddle to the maze, perhaps he will give you your true name so that you will never have anyone control you!
