You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself under the cursed sun of Cirath in a new oasis south of Tyr. You see a halfling chieftain cursing elves, and mumbling about someone helping him. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
