You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive within a fortress built from the black stone native to the area. You see a thirsty dwarf who is sweating profusely due to the hard labor and he looks like he could use a drink. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
