The orb flares brightly and then subsides, pulsing almost imperceptibly. 

You find yourself overlooking a crowded market area in the Bazaar. 

Off to the side, you see an aging woman who is mourning her husband lost at sea. You find yourself wanting to avoid the gaze of the widow, knowing somehow that her story will change your life...

A book wavers in your view, the words blurry. You are swept into the shocking cold of watery depths and search for a dead man's bones in order to bury them where the the book indicated they should rest… 

A final struggle between water and fire as something - or some one - tries to block the burial… 

You are snapped back into reality as the vision passes.
