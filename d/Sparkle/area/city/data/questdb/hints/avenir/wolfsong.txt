The dark fog moves in a twirling pattern, almost making you dizzy.  

You can sense that there are wolf bones scattered throughout the Utterdark and Sybarus, and you feel an urge to gather them up. Something in you wants to sing over them, over their final resting place. But where? You feel pulled through the darkness, emerging into the Source-lit cavern, flying toward the overgrown island known as the Holm. 

Just when you are about to look away you see yourself standing on a dark sand beach, looking straight at an obsidian natural wall. You focus your eyes on the wall and you can make out a strange carving, but before you have time to look at it closely the fog makes everything dark.
