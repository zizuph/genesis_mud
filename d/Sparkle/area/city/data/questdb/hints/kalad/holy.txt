You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in structure dedicated solely to the Sun Goddess, Solara. You see a compassionate woman who works in this sanctuary. She speaks to her followers of an evil that has been unleashed upon the world. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
