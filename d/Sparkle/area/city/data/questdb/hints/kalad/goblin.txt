You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a rocky room in the goblin caves outside of Kabal. You see a kabal guard chained up to the wall. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk,
instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
