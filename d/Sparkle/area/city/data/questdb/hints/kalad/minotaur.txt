You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing in a red carpet covered hall in the castle in Kabal. You see big marble sculpture of a minotaur in the room, which somehow seems compelling. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
