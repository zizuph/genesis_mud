You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a spacious room with a large circular table inside the Trading Company of Kalad. You see a fat trader sitting in his chair who seems to be running things around here. The way he talks to his guards makes you realize that he is in charge of bringing to justice people who have committed crimes against the Trading Company. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk,
instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
