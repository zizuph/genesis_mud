You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in library inside the Trading Company in Kalad. You see a librarian who is sorting and putting away books while he says: It is always the same when the Lord comes to research the object. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
