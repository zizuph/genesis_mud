You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself on the top floor of a house with an old mattress on the floor. You see an old human picking his teeth with his knife. He is constantly muttering about getting back what was taken from him by the guardsmen of the city. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
