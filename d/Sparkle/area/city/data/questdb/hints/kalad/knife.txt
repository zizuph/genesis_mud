You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself travelling on a street beside the bay in Kalad. You see a guardsman who suddenly grabs at an empty sheath at his boot. It appears someone has lifted his weapon from him.
Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
