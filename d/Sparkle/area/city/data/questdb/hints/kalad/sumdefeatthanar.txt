You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing, once again, on the precipice run south of Kalad. You see the same blacksmith standing near his forge. He seems to still be looking for someone to aid him with a second piece of his task. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
