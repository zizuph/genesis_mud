You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a central chamber in a cave system in the desert of Kalad. You see giants guarding a large stone with a great red orb in the middle of it. It seems to pulse with a mysterious and compelling energy. Suddenly your awareness shifts, and you briefly glimpse a ruined tower in the midst of some sand dunes. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
