You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the residence and office of the head shipwright of the Port District. You see a shipwright here working on his ship, grumbling about not having what he needs to finish his work. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
