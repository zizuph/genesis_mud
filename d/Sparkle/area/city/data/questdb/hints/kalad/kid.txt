You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself travelling on a street aside the bay in Kalad. You see a child trying to pickpocket items from people travelling down the street. He seems to have the most luck from people that are distracted. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
