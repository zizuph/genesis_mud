You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing in a museum in the northern part of the city of Kabal. You see an old historian who has an eager expression on his face. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
