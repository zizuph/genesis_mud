You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing on on a dusty gravel road in the farmlands west of Kalad. You see a bruised and bloody dwarven miner, he seems to be looking for someone to aid him. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
