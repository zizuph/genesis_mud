deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in the office of the Council Intelligence Agency in Kabal. A sneaky-looking man is here, a sly look on his face. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
