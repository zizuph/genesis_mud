You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in nomad tent in the desert of Kabal. You see a bedellin elder toiling over some strange work, all the while muttering about the cure for poisons. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
