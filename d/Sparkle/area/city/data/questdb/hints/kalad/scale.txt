You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself at the summit of a mountaintop outside Kabal City. You see an aged dwarf who looks rather sad. A look in his eye communicates that he is waiting to talk to someone who could prove themselves worthy of his time and attention. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
