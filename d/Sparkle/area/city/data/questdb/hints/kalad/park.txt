You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself standing inside a beautiful park in the western side of the city of Kabal. You see a rich noble taking a stroll in the park with his bodyguard, muttering about something important to him. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
