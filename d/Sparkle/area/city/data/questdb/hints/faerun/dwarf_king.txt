You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in an ancient citadel hidden deep within Kryptgarden Forest in Faerun. You see a ghost of a dwarf who looks clearly upset by something. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
