You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself in a large room inside a farmhouse. You see a jovial hard-working woman busy baking some bread. She pauses and frowns, apparently realizing something unpleasant. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
