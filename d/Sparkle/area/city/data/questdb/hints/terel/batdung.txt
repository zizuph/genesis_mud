You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a hovel in the northwestern parts of the Silver Forest of Terel. You see an old witch and her cat. She seems to be preparing a special kind of brew in her pot. The witch is searching frantically through her spices and other ingredients, but cannot seem to find what she is looking for. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
