You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a big garden in Terel. You see an old gardener preparing some sort of bug spray as he mumbles something about finally being rid of certain pests. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
