You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a big garden in Terel. You see an old gardener working in the garden. As he reaches out to nurse one of the flowers, you notice a pale spot on his arm where a bracelet used to be. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
