You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a greenhouse just west of Calathin in Terel. You see a gardener working in his yard. He pauses suddenly, and rubs his dirty hands with a look of pain on his face. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
