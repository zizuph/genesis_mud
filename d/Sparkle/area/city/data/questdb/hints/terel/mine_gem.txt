You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a mining tunnel below the Mansion of Terel. You see metal veins in the walls there appear to be some nuggets to be obtained from here still. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
