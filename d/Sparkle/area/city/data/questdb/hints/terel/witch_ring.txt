You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a hovel in the northwestern parts of the Silver Forest of Terel. You see an old witch and her cat. She is talking to the cat about an old ring of power that belonged to her grandmother, yet it has become lost when her grandmother disappeared. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
