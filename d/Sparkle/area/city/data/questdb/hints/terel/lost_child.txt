You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive before a modest looking house just west of Calathin in Terel. You see a crying woman who repeatedly is calling out for her lost son, Edward. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
