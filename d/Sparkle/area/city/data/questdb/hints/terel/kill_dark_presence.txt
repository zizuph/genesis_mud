You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a Mansion in Terel. You see a dark presence before you, he looks terrifying. You peer at your empty hands, and feel the need for a mighty weapon to strike him down. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
