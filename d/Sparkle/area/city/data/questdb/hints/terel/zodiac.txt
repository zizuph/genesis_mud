You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive inside a room in the Mansion in Terel where everything appears rotten. You see a silver door and a picture of a rainbow above it. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
