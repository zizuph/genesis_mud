You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in a secret room inside a Mansion in Terel. You see a scale here as well as a stack of coins. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
