You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a small stable yard in the southern part of Terel. You see a scarred grumpy elf who is cursing over his lost ring. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
