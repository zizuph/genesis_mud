You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive in the caravan office of Calathin. The clerk appears to be shuffling through some schedules. He talks to an assistant about previous raids on the caravan from bandits in the forest, and how he wishes he could afford more guards. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
