You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of
deep concentration. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into
the black orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a snow covered area
in the northwestern parts of the Ice Mountains in Terel. You become aware of
a bitter blue-haired male human, frozen to the ground he sits upon. He is
shivering violently. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body
with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
