  All entities in the world, be they physical or ethereal, possess natural
  energies unique to their form. Should such form be disrupted, those
  energies are often transformed into raw, unbound power that will
  seek the nearest and most compelling host. When such a host is found,
  and the powers have successfully bound themselves to the new form, we
  refer to this phenomenon as enchantment or imbuement.

  It is rare for enchantment to occur in nature. Typically, an item will
  only become imbued with power when some external and powerful magical
  force has caused the disruption of the form in which the power was
  originally found to reside. The Art of Enchantment is a long-studied
  form of magic in which practitioners of the art become adept in guiding
  the process of form disruption, transfer of energy, and rebinding. The
  basics of this art will be discussed on the next page.
