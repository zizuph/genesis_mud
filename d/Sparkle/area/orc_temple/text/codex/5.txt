  The Art of Enchanting, involving the processes described on page 3 is
  too advanced for all but the most learned scholars of magic. Even so,
  it is possible for the apt student to participate in the beginnings of
  the art by learning to craft their own Enchantments. Before one can
  begin, one needs three things: a host object, imbuement stones,
  and an enchanters forge.

  The host object may be any item of a suitable type (typically, an
  armour or a weapon of some kind) that the owner wishes to transfer
  imbuement energies into.

  Enchantment stones will be discussed in detail on page 6, and the
  enchanters forge on page 7.
