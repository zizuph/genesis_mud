  Should you bring me an enchanted object, and a sufficient number of
  nullstones, I will <transmogrify> the object. The result will be
  imbuement stones that you will be able to collect and use in your
  crafting efforts.

  Specific imbuements result in specific stone types. For example, an
  object imbued with the power to create darkness, when transmogrified,
  will produce a nightstone. Likewise, each specific power has a
  corresponding stone type. It will be up to each individual student to
  learn to recognize each type of stone for the specific powers of
  imbuement it is known to possess.

  Stones have five different qualities: cracked, blemished, ordinary,
  unblemished, and glittering. These qualities indicate the potential of
  the stone. Once you have three stones of a given quality of the same
  type, you can <combine> those three stones to upgrade to a single stone
  of the next highest quality. For example, three cracked nightstones
  could be combined to form a single blemished nightstone.

  The power of a given enchantment will determine the quality of the
  stone that is produced during transmogrification. Most enchantments
  produce cracked stones. However, it is possible to find enchanements
  of greater power that will yield a blemished stone. Only the rarest
  and most frighteningly powerful enchantments will yield a stone of
  ordinary quality. Unblemished and glittering stones can only be
  achieved by combining stones of lesser quality together, and will
  never result from transmogrification.
