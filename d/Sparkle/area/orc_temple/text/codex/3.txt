  These are the basic practices involved in the Art of Enchantment:

  Disintegration     - An Enchanter disrupts the form of some entity,
                       causing its natural energies to drift freely into
                       the surrounding ether.

  Conduction         - An Enchanter transfers the energies from the ether
                       through an intermediary host into the final entity
                       into which they will be bound.

  Imbuement          - An Enchanter binds the energies into the host entity,
                       transforming the item into a new and powerful form.

  Disenchantment     - Similar to disintegreation except that this process is
                       performed on an item that has already been enchanted.
                       The Enchanter siphons the enchantments away from the
                       item prior to disintegration to preserve them for
                       later use.

  Transmogrification - An Enchanter combines the processes of disenchantment
                       and conduction to remove specific imbuements from
                       an enchanted item. The process requires the use of
                       nullstones, which themselves will be transformed by
                       the process once the powers become nested within them.
