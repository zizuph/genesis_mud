  The trained eye will be able to recognize an object that has been imbued
  with the powers of enchantment at a single glance. Most such objects will
  have an "unusual" appearance. Such an appearance suggests that the object
  in question has become host to energies from some disrupted form. Closer
  inspection of the object will likely reveal some manifestation of the
  power held within. As a student of Enchantment becomes more experienced
  they will even be able to recognize specific manifestations as an
  indicator of a specific type of power. It will be up to each individual
  student to keep records of these things as they are able, for such
  details are too important to be cheaply recorded in such pages as these.

  On rare occasions, an object will display "peculiar" characteristics.
  Rarer still will be any objects that appear "exotic" in nature. Any who
  find such objects as these would be well advised to return to me to allow
  me to <identify> them, for these items are among the rarest types one
  can find.

  A further note: The manifestations you may learn to recognize in a given
  imbued object will have slight variations from time to time in their
  intensity. Careful observers of these phenomena will learn to know when
  an item of truly rare power has come into their possession. Again, I
  will always be willing to <identify> such objects for you if you wish.

  **NOTE: The <imbuement> command allows someone to make a specific
          mention to the immortals if you find there is something that
          seems to not be working properly.
