  The Enchanter's Forge is a construct that replicates the most basic
  and low-level acts of Conduction and Imbuement for students of the
  art. Using the forge, students will be able to create their own
  "unusual" items. Items of "peculiar" or "exotic" nature are beyond
  the means of the forge, and can only be crafted by a true master.

  To use the forge, one must <fit> a particular imbuement stone in the
  socket atop the device, and then <insert> the host object. This will
  result in either a successful imbuement, or one of the following:

    the stone turns red   - the host object cannot accept the type of
                            power contained in this imbuement stone

    the stone turns black - the host object cannot accept powers of any
                            kind.

    the stone hisses      - the power within the stone has somehow been
                            temporarily disabled by the immortals. You
                            might want to ask them about it, or just
                            wait and try again in the future.

  The power of the enchantment crafted successfully into a host will
  increase with the quality of the stone. Cracked and blemished stones
  are not powerful enough to craft imbuements, and will first need to
  be combined and upgraded to sufficient levels of quality.

  Final note: While an imbuement will always increase the power of its
              host object, objects that are already supremely powerful
              may experience a less dramatic increase in their power
              than items that are less formidable to begin with.

  I bid you fortune in your crafting endeavors.
