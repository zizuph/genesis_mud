210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, December 17

Karkadelt has grown strange in the last few weeks. I have seen him in
what appears to be meditative prayer, and I sense that he is in some
form of communication with Yog-Sothoth. He will NOT become the vessel
for my master's power! Only I am worthy of this. I will kill my brother
before I allow him to usurp me a second time!
