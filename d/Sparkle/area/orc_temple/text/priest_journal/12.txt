208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 10

I have spent nearly two months among the orcs. I now consider them to be
my own people. My studies and experiments in the temple have added to
their reverence and fear of me, so much so, in fact, that they have decided
to make me their new High Priest. A fitting irony, perhaps!

Kalak, though, is real. My knowledge of the dark arts has made it far simpler
to interpret the signs here than it would have been had I chosen to pursue
pure enchantment as a youth, like my brother. He would be merely
confused by what is happening here. I have much more to discover, but
from what I have already learned, there is a planar rift beneath this
temple. The orcs have no idea what this might mean, but I shall test its
true potentials soon.
