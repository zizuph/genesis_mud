208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 10

Mother can sense something has changed in me. I care nothing for the
cloying advances of Silvette and Karkadelt. My foolish siblings know
nothing of me or my torment, and I will not give them the satisfaction
of knowing even the smallest detail of my deeds. They pretend to care and
to wish me well, but things remain as they always have been. At least
with my sister, the pure-blood scorn is sincere. Karkadelt's opinion
is nothing but a joke. His blood is no more pure than my own, but he
continues to benefit from his fair elven features. Would that he knew
he looks more like our father than he ever dared imagine.
