209th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 30

There have been no further disturbances from outsiders, and we have been
able to settle into a satisfactory regimen. I must train more of the
youth to be effective Runts, however. The next few months we must have
a steady stream of new prisoners. Moreover, the prisoners shall be collected
from a wide region, so that we do not incur the attention of a particular
community again. As much as I do not fear invaders, I DO fear disruptions.
The feeding must not be compromised, even for a short while.
