211th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 18

The efforts were successful. Though we have not been able to locate my
brother, enough prisoners were brought back from Sparkle to feed the
belly of the Demon, sating it for now. We must immediately redouble
our efforts. This time, I am commanding the Runts to move outward to
the north, infiltrating Dwarfheim if necessary to meet the needs of the
feeding. I will continue to work on the matter of enchanting as I am
able, but the hunger of my master is the most important thing at the
present time.

Moreover, Yog-Sothoth has acknowledged these threats to its feeding
that it had formerly taken for granted. It has extended a powerful force
of its presence to all areas of the dungeon now, such that any who it
deems powerful enough to pose a threat shall be driven mad with fear, and
unable to remain within the premesis.

Myself and many of the orcs soon found ourselves fleeing due to our own
strengths. I have been quickly able to counteract the problem by feeding
us all small doses of strength sapping potions. As a result, those of us
who remain to do the work of the feeding are vastly weaker than we once
were, but the fact that none but the very weakest creatures - those
beneath Yog-Sothoth's recognition, will be able to come here in the
future provides us the security we need to continue without further
harassments. I feel quite satisfied with the arrangement - let the foolish
champions come now and feel the full might of Yog-Sothoth's horror!
