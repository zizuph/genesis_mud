208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 12

This day has been fantastic! I awoke to the smell of smoke burning quite
nearby. Tracing the smell, I came upon a clearing off the road where a
small band of orcs had set up a camp. They were taken aback by my boldness
and lack of fear, but despite my brother's claims, I too am a powerful
user of magic. A few simple compulsion spells, and the orcs were ready
to cooperate with me. If only my mother had not protected our villagers
from such manipulation, things would have been VERY different for me as
a child.

Tomorrow, we will journey to their village. I am confident that my
ability to influence these people will not waver.
