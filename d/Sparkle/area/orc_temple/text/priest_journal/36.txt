210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 16

The bone flute does indeed work. Playing it in the prison cells calls
forth the spirits of the dead, which can then be killed to collect their
crystalline tears. My brother insists that these tears are the main
reagent needed to craft my own powerful enchantments to be placed into
the weapons of my choice. He tells me I must collect at least eight
tears to power the process. I work to do this now.
