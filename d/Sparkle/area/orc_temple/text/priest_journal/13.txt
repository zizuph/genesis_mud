208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, October 3

Summer is gone, and the Fall Season is well begun. My fevered work over
the last four months has been invaluable. With the orcs' assistance, I
have been able to contain what I now know to be the DEMON Kalak. Though
it is only a minor demon, this exercise has been a vast learning
opportunity for me. Only a very small pentagram was needed to channel the
forces of planar repulsion necessary to keep the demon present and at bay. 

From Kalak, I have learned much. This demon is only a peon among its kind,
but clearly far more powerful than most advanced mages in our realm. If 
I had not known to take the many precautions I did, it could and would
have destroyed me with ease. As it is, I fear it not, for it cannot
escape my containment field.

Kalak speaks as one of many minor subjects in its realm devoted to a greater
demon who rules their region of existance. This demon, calling itself
Nug, I was able to contact via a ritual of soul immersion, in which I
carefully employed Kalak's soul as a puppet through which to speak to Nug.
Nug has shown me that there is a far greater being - a full
Arch Demon who Nug refers to as a child might to a parent - who rules
over the cosmos of the demon realm. This God-Demon is known as
Yog-Sothoth, the Devourer. Imagine the potential!
