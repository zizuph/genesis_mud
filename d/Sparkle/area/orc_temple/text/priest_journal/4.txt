208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 16

At supper this evening, I pressed Mother for a shift in our roles. Too
long has my brother enjoyed his select status as village Enchanter. I,
too, am gifted with magic, and deserve a chance to prosper as he has.
Pathetic worm that he is, Karkadelt became enraged and accused me of
threatening my own mother! His attempts to hoard the glory in our family
are so very transparent. Silvette employed her usual tactic of silent
acknowledgement. She wishes to copy mother, but her vain attempts to
seem a lofty elf maiden are hollow. She will never be like Mother.
Silvette doesn't care if I live or die. This feeling is mutual!
