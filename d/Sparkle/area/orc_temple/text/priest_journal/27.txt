210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 7

Success! The tribes have risen to the call, and we sent an even mightier
horde into Sparkle this day! Many Runts, Warriors, Shaman, and even
multiple of the Colossus orcs waylaid the city as our strike force
went in for as many women and children as could be returned. It was a
sure victory, for while the diversionary forces were slain, we made
off with sufficient prisoners to feed the demon afresh.
