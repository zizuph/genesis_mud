210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, September 10

My brother has tested my patience too far! He finally claims to have
finished the Forge, but now insists that there is a rare element that will
be required to actually put it to use. Today, I brought Silvette again
before the Pit for torment with Karkadelt forced to watch. To my
astonishment, Silvette managed to break free of her bindings and leap
into the pit! She was immediately devoured, flesh and bone, by Yog-
Sothoth - something I have never witnessed before. The dungeon bucked and
heaved under the deep moans and vibrations that emanated from the demon
then, but this quieted in time. Strangely, Karkadelt seemed calm in
the aftermath, and looked me squarely in the eye for the first time since
coming to these dungeons. I do not trust him! Back to the cells he shall
go until he reveals what must be done with the forge!
