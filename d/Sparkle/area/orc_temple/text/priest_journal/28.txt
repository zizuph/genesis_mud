210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 12

Something most strange has taken place! Unusual phenomenon have begun to
occur around the dungeon. The Jailer is reporting the appearance of
ghosts within the prison cells. I care nothing for this, but am most
highly intrigued by the reports that numerous pieces of armour and
weaponry have been displaying unusual, peculiar, and even exotic
qualities - all of which seem to increase their power! Though I have not
yet had the time to properly test my theory, I suspect that these
phenomena are due to the release of souls when the demon was assaulted
by the elves! I must investigate further.
