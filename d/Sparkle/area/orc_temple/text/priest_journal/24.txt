210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 18

The parade of prisoners brought before me by the Jailer continues to
occasion a face from my past. How pathetic that these people, now,
seeing that I command their destruction, choose to repent their earlier
treatment of me. Bah. They chose their path! Even were I in the
mood to be merciful and forgive, I am but a tool for the great hunger
of Yog-Sothoth now. There can be no mercy - only feeding.
