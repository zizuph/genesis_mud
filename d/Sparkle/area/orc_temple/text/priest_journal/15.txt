209th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 29

Preparations are nearly complete. I have developed a robust task-force
from the orcs of the village, and have enlisted ongoing support from
neighboring tribes, who will replace our ranks as needed. The Runts,
our smallest citizens, will be responsible for capturing and returning
prisoners to the dungeon. The Warriors will see to the security needs
of the dungeon. I have found a particularly boastful fellow named
Blukkmak. He is stupid, but the others fear his size and strength. I
will put him in charge of the prison level and give him reign over its
operations. The orcs in the village who have shown potential with
magic, I have trained to know the ways of priesthood so that they might
assist me in the constant devotions necessary to keep Yog-Sothoth
comfortable and at peace.

Soon, THE SUPREME IT will be among us.
