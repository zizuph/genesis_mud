209th Year of the Fifth Cycle, November 24

The feeding progresses at a satisfactory pace. Yog-Sothoth has been
pleased with my work, and has continued to reward me with knowledge and
power. I do, however, grow concerned that we will need to do even more to
expand our search radius for new prisoners, We cannot maintain this level of
procurement without incurring another angry mob from the local populace.
I will share this concern with Yog-Sothoth soon.
