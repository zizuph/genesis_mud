210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 30

This has been a day full of vindication! Brought before the Pit, my
brother and sister were subject to the full force of my powers amplified
by the might of Yog-Sothoth! Both were reduced to whimpering slaves
as I cast my spells of compulsion upon them, forcing them to abide
by my will. They will spend the rest of their days in my prison, working
as I command! Mother, be proud of your only meaningful offspring!
