210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 15

Karkadelt has proven insolent, and thus I have used Silvette as a lever.
She has been tortured before his eyes, and he now knows that unless he
cooperates fully with me, he will endure more of her torment. It is not
surprising that he has revealed much in a single day. Apparently, a key
to the puzzle is the very ghosts that roam the dungeon. I must harvest
their crystalline tears! Apparently, to kill a ghost is to release their
soul and produce such a tear. But one can only summon a ghost via a very
specific artifact my brother has described as a "bone flute." I will
create this instrument from the bones of former prisoners!
