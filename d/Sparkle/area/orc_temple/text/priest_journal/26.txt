210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 5

Disaster! Unthinkable disaster! The elves ... how I should have moved to
further diversify our targets! The elves rose against us, their time-worn
discipline and wisdom proving sufficient to overcome the innate horrors
of Yog-Sothoth ... they overran our dungeon, slew all of us, and even
made entry into the containment pit of Yog-Sothoth itself! The Demon's
incarnation was nearly slain before it was able to employ its last vestiges
of wrath upon the invaders, destroying most of them, and casting the
remainder from our dungeon in fits of madness. From the Supreme It,
I have learned that mother was among them! I will have to deal
with this disturbing fact another time, though, for Yog-Sothoth's 
need has been unleashed with its power! In nearly being slain, it
released many of its contained souls, and has newfound hunger much akin
to that of its first days among us!

I have summoned all aid from the neighboring tribes. Sparkle again must
be our target if we are to appease the demon.
