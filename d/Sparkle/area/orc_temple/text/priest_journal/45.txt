211th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 15

Great Hell of Hells! Karkadelt has nearly destroyed us all! Somehow he
and Silvette seem to have planned for this, I am sure of it. Today, he
broke free of his bonds near to the Pit, and himself dove into the
very opening, descending into the Containment Field that binds Yog-
Sothoth to this realm. Somehow, Silvette remained there, alive and
yet hidden, waiting for him. Together, they managed to sever the bonds
that tie the demon to this world, nearly killing It, and at the same time
releasing EVERY SINGLE SOUL the demon has ever devoured while in this
plane! I cannot imagine what this will mean! Silvette perished in the
aftermath, and I nearly killed Karkadelt myself. He somehow managed to
escape, however, and fled into the woods. I have commanded my orcs to
find him no matter what!

Yog-Sothoth is calling me. It is weak, and requires my immediate and
full ministry. I must obey! Gods save me from what this may mean!
