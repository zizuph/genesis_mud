208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 22

My research into the insignia born by my father has progressed. Much as
I dislike Harstaff, his pedigree as a well-traveled woodsman cannot be
denied. He recognizes the symbol as one worn by orcs far to the northeast.
I have never travelled so close to Sparkle myself, but perhaps the time
is coming when that will need to change. Mother clearly fears for me and
I can sense her growing concern that I will leave. She is the only reason
I have not already burned this worthless village to the ground.
