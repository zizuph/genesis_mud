210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 30

The forge is still not finished. I do not know what my brother is playing
at, but I have again brought Silvette before him for torment. He seems
very close to madness, but he managed, between his pathetic displays of
emotion, to again promise that he would finish soon. For Silvette's sake,
he had better do exactly that.
