208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 19

I have left Shalewood never to return! I have been betrayed by my entire
family - even Mother! Her tearful pleas were horrible to listen to, but
how can I stay when she herself will not face the truth! She has been
poisoned by Karkadelt! If I ever return, it will be to KILL him. That,
however, I will not do so long as Mother lives. The one satisfaction I
have is to have taken my brother's oh-so-precious Enchanter's Robe. Ha!
Let him ply his pathetic trade in trousers for a few weeks until a new
one can be made.
