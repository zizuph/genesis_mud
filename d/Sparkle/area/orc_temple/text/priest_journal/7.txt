208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 25

I have travelled nearly a week, heading north and east, following the
road that old Bertram assured me would take me toward Sparkle. The woods
and the wild lands are far more comforting to me than Shalewood ever was.
Here, I feel no judgement from the elves and humans. Their self-superior
smugness will not be missed.
