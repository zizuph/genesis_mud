208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 20

I have learned a great many things among the orcs. At first, I assumed
that the worship of the god Kalak was merely superstition from a crude
and uncivilized tribe. It is not so. There is definitely a presence of
considerable power within the Temple. I must learn what this presence
is. Surely, not a God ... but something. I must know.
