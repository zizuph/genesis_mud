210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 24

How amusing! Today, the Jailer brought before me three prisoners I
recognized all too well - Old Bertram and his sons! How satisfying it
was to see those guilty of taking part in my torment as a youth
brought before the Demon for feeding! Did I not predict this would
someday be their fate? Fools!
