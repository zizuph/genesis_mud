208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 3

I met a traveller on the road today - a dwarven merchant who clearly has
a wide trade route. He was not at all concerned by my appearance, and 
seemed interested to know where I was from. I told him nothing, of course,
but was able to purchase a few provisions. I also learned from him that I
am getting quite close to the so-called Orc Forest west of Sparkle. I
grow eager to make contact with these people.
