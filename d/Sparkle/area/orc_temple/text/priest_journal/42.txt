210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, November 6

I have begun my own experiments with the Enchanter's Forge. There are
plenty of spare ghosts to produce the crystalline tears needed for
the enchantment, and I have but to find the correct reagent. I have tried
many different elements, and all have resulted in either no effect or a
brief enchantment followed by a swift decay and dissolution of the
imbuement. Unacceptable! I must find a way to unlock the secrets of
this process!
