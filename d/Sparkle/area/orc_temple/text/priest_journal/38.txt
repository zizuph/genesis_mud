210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 24

Karkadelt works too slowly! I have shown him the ways in which Silvette
can scream for a second time. I think it nearly drove him mad. But he
has promised to finish the Enchanter's Forge in the next few days. I
trust he means it. He has claimed that the delay is due to the fact
that something called a "nullstone" dagger is required to create the
needed binding. He has been creating these nullstone daggers, but I 
suspect it is just a stalling tactic.
