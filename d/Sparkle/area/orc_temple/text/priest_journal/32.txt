210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 25

All too easy! I knew my brother would come like a moth to flame at the
mention of an all-powerful demon unleashed upon the world! Of course, my
story was that I had been foolish, that I had toyed with powers beyond
my control, that I was afraid, and needed my brother's help! HA! Simple
tugs on the strings by the puppetmaster, and my brother has danced
according to my every gesture! He and my idiotic sister Silvette accompany
me even now back to the Orc Fortress. How I long for the moment when both
shall be brought before the Pit!
