209th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 25

Much time has passed since I lifted pen to this account. No longer am I
the self-doubting son of orc and elf. I have risen to a higher purpose!
The Demon Yog-Sothoth is mine - mine to serve! How foolish I was to
imagine that I might have designs on this great and mighty cosmic
master. No ... THE SUPREME IT has all along designed to use ME for its
vast and worthy hunger. The dungeon is constructed now, and the pentagram
chamber above the containment pit secure. In a few months I shall bring
the small piece of Yog-Sothoth's essence that it has allocated to this
realm into being, and the feeding shall begin.
