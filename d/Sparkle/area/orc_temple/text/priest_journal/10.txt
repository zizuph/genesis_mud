208th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 13

The orc village surrounds a crude but still very impressive fortress within
which is a temple devoted to their god, Kalak. Interestingly, the chieftain of
the village seemed startled when he saw me, appearing almost fearful.
I have come to learn that my father was, in fact, a High Priest among
these people. For the first time in my life, I am actually benefitting from
my resemblance to him! I have told the orcs that my father was slain by
my half-orc brother, who could not stand being less than a full elf and feared
that my father would some day reveal his true pedigree. I went on to tell them
how I, being unmistakably orcish by looks alone, was driven from my village
thanks to my brother's cruel influence. As I had hoped, the orcs were outraged
to hear of this. This village feels like home more than any I have ever
known. If only Mother were with me. She found the ability to love my orcish
father. Surely she could come to appreciate these people.
