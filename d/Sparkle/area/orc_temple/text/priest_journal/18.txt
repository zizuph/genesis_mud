209th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 23

The foolish villagers from Sparkle decided to mount an attack against
us in retaliation. The power of Yog-Sothoth was more than enough to
prevent them from penetrating the containment chamber, but they did
manage to kill many Runts and Warriors, and nearly killed the Jailer!
Yog-Sothoth, sensing this as an unnaceptable threat to its hunger, has
decided to grant both Blukkmak and myself the highest possible honour!
We have sacrificed ourselves to its hunger, but it has restored our
souls to bodies it Itself has created. Blukkmak hardly is worthy of
this, but I can agree that we do not have time to train another for his
position should he meet an untimely demise. But I ... I AM NOW AN
IMMORTAL! Karkadelt would tear his own flesh if he knew this! His petty
jealousy would finally be apparent for all to see!
