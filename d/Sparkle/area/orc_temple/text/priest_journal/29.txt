210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 30

Bah! I am certain now that many of our weapons and armours were indeed
imbued with considerable power when the demon was forced to defend
itself. My tests, however, proved unsuccessful and I have destroyed all
of the unusual items in my experiments. These items were powerful! I
must find a way to again generate them, using the demon's natural
forces. If only I could remember more of the ways of enchanting that
I studied as a youth!
