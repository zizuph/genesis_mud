209th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 19

YOG-SOTHOTH REIGNS AMONG US! Two days ago, it was successfuly brought
into the Containment Pit, but I had not anticipated the immediate
savagery of its hunger. Within the first four hours, all of our
prisoners had been expended on its appetite, and I was forced to
sacrifice a few of the Runts as well to prevent a catastrophe! As its
belly was filled with souls, the pace of its hunger slowed enough to
allow me to dispatch an emergency attack force to the nearby town
of Sparkle to bring more prisoners immediately here. I called on the
neighboring tribes who have powerful and strange members of their
species that our village is not accustomed to. Runts, Warriors,
Shaman, odd bloated creatures, and a monstrous Colossus orc were able
to create enough of a diversion that my task forces of runts managed
to carry back many women and children. These will hopefully meet the
demand for the next few weeks. Had I known Yog-Sothoth would arrive
with an empty belly, I would have planned much differently!
