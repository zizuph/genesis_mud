210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 17

Mother's condition has worsened. Her wounds have begun to heal, but she is
not herself. Two separate personalities appear to exist within her now. In
the one, she stares blindly at the sky, and will only speak the word "Thoth"
as if chanting some type of mantra. For very brief moments, she appears to
come out of this state, perhaps to her true person. But these moments of
lucidity are entirely spent in endless weeping. Silvette and I know not what
we can do, but will stay by her side and hope for this to end.
