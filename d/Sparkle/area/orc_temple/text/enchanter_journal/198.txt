220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, September 24

Today, a human named Dracart brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic broken black chainmail that he asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while
one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others
are quite above normal!
