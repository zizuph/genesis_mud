210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 2

Eternal Hells! Mother somehow was able to master herself today, for nearly
an hour of time. In that time, she spoke clearly and with her own true voice
to both Silvette and myself, revealing to us all that has come to pass. IT
IS KERCHAK WHO HAS DONE THIS! This was the secret my mother could not bear to
tell before she left with the attack force. She had sensed that it was my own
brother who had summoned this horror to the world. And what a horror it is!
Mother has spoken of an Arch Demon who calls itself Yog-Sothoth that has been
brought to our world by Kerchak, thereby enslaving not only him, but an entire
region of the orcs to do its bidding. The demon is a devourer of souls, and
has been using the orcs to bring him continuously fresh numbers of victims
upon which to feast.

Mother told of how the army, after successfully breaking through the outer
defenses of the Fortress, made their way into the dungeons beneath. Almost at
once, all of the humans fled in terror of some spirit of horror that fills
that place, leaving the elves alone to continue onward. They succeeded in
slaughtering all of the orcs they found, and thrust their way down to the
lower levels, where they encountered and slew my brother and his priest
minions. Mother would not speak of what happened next, but was again overcome
with long moments of inconsolable weeping.

When she recovered, she spoke in earnest of what must be done. She says that
Kerchak is not dead, for she has kept a part of her mind locked on to
his, and that he has been given a kind of immortality by the demon. She knows
that Kerchak will soon seek me out, and will ask me to come with him. She said
this presents a single chance to defeat the demon, and that it will require
both Silvette and I. I have heard her plan, and it is unthinkable! I would
sooner die than prolong my brothers demoncraft!
