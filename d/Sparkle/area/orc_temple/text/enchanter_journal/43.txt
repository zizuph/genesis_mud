212th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 1

Today, a human named Zestana brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic steel plate helmet that she asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while two of
the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a level of
power that is truly terrifying!
