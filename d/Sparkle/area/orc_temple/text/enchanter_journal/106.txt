215th Year of the Fifth Cycle, November 17

Today, a human named Syrk brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
dirty golden cloak that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while two of
the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a level of
power that is truly terrifying!
