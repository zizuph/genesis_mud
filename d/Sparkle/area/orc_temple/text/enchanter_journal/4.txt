210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 13

First Bertram and now the Sarpenthals! Harstaff returned at midday today
with news that all twenty three of the Sarpenthals have gone missing.
This time, there was no mistaking the signs. Evidence of some sort of skirmish
was present in the yard, and three of the family dogs had been slain. Harstaff
does not know what to make of this. He felt that the footprints and other
markings pointed to orcs, but it is well known that the Fallen Race do not
typically care to take prisoners, and never in such amounts as this. Orcs,
too, would have been likely to kill the women and children and take only the
men, were they in the need for a slave. All are deeply concerned by this,
and talk in the taverns and on the streetcorners was steady on these omens
until nightfall.
