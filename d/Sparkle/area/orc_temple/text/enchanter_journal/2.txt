210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 7

Business has been good. Only three customers came to see me in all of Winter,
but this week alone no less than five of the human villagers have paid me good
coin to enchant their seeds. My stock of mercurystone is quite robust this
year, and it pains me little to earn generous payment from those who did not
plant their annuals in time for the festival. The elven district chuckles at
the competetive nature of the humans. The elves, of course, have the most
beautiful flowers every festival, but it is not in their nature to enter them
for the judging. This means a great deal to the humans, however - and how could
a humble enchanter like myself refuse such an opportunity to profit?
