213th Year of the Fifth Cycle, September 7

Today, a human named Castaneda brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic tempered steel fullplate armour that he asked me to disenchant
contained three separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact
that while two of the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the
third has a level of power that is truly terrifying!
