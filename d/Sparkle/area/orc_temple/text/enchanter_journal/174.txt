219th Year of the Fifth Cycle, September 4

Today, a drow named Poultry brought in an outrageously rare find. The
exotic light thanoi harpoon that she asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three
imbuements are of different levels of power. One is the standard level, one
is quite above normal, and the other is terrifying!
