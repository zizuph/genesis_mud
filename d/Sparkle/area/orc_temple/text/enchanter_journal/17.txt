210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 8

Today, we held a ceremony of remembrance for all the departed, naming them
as we burned the bodies we have, sending their ashes to the heavens. Silvette
claims she felt the presence of orcs in the woods, but if any were there,
they did not choose to disturb us. How I wish that they had, for I would have
slaughtered them all with my bare hands!
