220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, December 20

Today, a minotaur named Zhabou brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic horned iron helmet that she asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of
the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are
quite above normal!
