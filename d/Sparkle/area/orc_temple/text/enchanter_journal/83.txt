215th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 3

Today, a dwarf named Irk brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
ebony spiked club that he asked me to transmogrify contained three separate
imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while two of the
imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a level of
power that is truly terrifying!
