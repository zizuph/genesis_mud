212th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 5

Today, a goblin named Habiki brought in a nearly unheard-of find! The
exotic pair of heavy iron greaves that he asked me to transmogrify
contained three separate imbuements. What is so fascinating is that an
imbuement of standard power is joined here by not one, but two imbuements
of truly terrifying power!
