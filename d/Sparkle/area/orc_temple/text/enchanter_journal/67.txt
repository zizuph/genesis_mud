214th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 23

Today, a human named Freya brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
tempered steel fullplate armour that it asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while
one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others
are quite above normal!
