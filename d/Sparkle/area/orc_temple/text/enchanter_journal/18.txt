210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 15

I am calmer now, and the blindness of grief has begun to ebb. As such, I have
been able to hear Silvette's words more clearly, and am haunted by Mother's
final wishes. Much as I loathe the idea of enduring my brother's presence
without striking him down, I see wisdom in the plan, much as it seems unlikely
to succeed. I must meditate on these things.
