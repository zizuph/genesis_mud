214th Year of the Fifth Cycle, January 13

Today, a presence named Hektor brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic serrated iron scimitar that he asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while
one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others
are quite above normal!
