210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 20

Harstaff's men returned today with an entire company of the elves! Being not
well-travelled myself, I find it fascinating to see such a host of the Fair
People. These are unlike those who have lived among humans in the village.
Their manner and their methods are subtle to the point of almost being 
disturbing. I can see how they have come to be feared among the races who
call them enemy, for there is a death in the eyes of these elves. They claim
to have never feared the Fallen Race before, but there is something that has
changed. Their Seers have all spoken of a great and terrible power that has
come into the region (surely the same that mother has felt!) The elves will
stay among us for a time to make council, to decide what must happen next.
