220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 6

Today, a dwarf named Raelle brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
broken pair of padded bracers that she asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while
one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others
are quite above normal!
