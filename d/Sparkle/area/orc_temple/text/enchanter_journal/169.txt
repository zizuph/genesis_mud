219th Year of the Fifth Cycle, May 7

Today, an imbuement request from a goblin named Syrk yielded an exceedingly
rare find. The exotic blackened mithril lance that he received contained
three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while
one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others
are quite above normal!
