218th Year of the Fifth Cycle, January 9

Today, a human named Kalten brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
twisted wooden staff that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while two of
the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a level of
power that is truly terrifying!
