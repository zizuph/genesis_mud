216th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 15

Today, a dwarf named Irk brought in an outrageously rare find. The exotic
strong spear that he asked me to transmogrify contained three separate
imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three imbuements are of
different levels of power. One is the standard level, one is quite above
normal, and the other is terrifying!
