216th Year of the Fifth Cycle, December 9

Today, a human named Wartak brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
dented steel helm that she asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of
the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are
quite above normal!
