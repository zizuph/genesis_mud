211th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 16

It is done, at the price of six months of torment, the death of both Mother
and Sister, and a great deal of my own sanity. I can only pray that it
has not entirely been in vain. The demon was not severed from our world, but
much was done to weaken it, and I know now of a way to at least undo some of
the damage that is being done.

The constant disintegration of souls by the demon has thrust an unheard of
amount of raw and unbound energies into the ether. These energies have
begun the process of conduction of their own accord, and have begun to bind
themselves to host items that they encounter. The resulting imbuements are
filling the realms with strange new powers that I am sure many adventurers
will wish to make use of. I have come to Sparkle to set up a shop that I
hope will allow me to work with such adventurers so that I can free as many
of these trapped soul fragments as I am able.

What is more, I will enlist the aid of any who are able to keep watch on
the doings of Kerchak, who has now been forced to weaken himself and the
entirety of his orc forces. The demon will suffer no more threats to its
sovereignty, and so I will need to fashion some device by which would-be
invaders can safely venture into the dungeon.
