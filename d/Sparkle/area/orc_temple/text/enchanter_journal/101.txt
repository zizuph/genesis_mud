215th Year of the Fifth Cycle, September 20

Today, a dwarf named Un brought in an outrageously rare find. The exotic
pair of steel gauntlets that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three imbuements
are of different levels of power. One is the standard level, one is quite
above normal, and the other is terrifying!
