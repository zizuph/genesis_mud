211th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 3

Today, a wraith named Etanukar brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic golden-trimmed cloak that he asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while
two of the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a
level of power that is truly terrifying!
