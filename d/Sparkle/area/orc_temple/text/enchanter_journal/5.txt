210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 20

Three more families have been taken. All of Shalewood is in an uproar over it,
and demands have risen for Harstaff to call for aid. He is a proud man, and
does not like the idea of needing help to defend his people. Nonetheless,
today he took council with some of the elders among the elves in the village
to discuss plans to contact their kinsfolk in the southeast. I can sense that
mother is deeply distressed, and not merely due to the disappearances. I
have not seen her this upset since my brother's departure.
