215th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 28

Today, an elf named Staerek brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
charred orichalcum chainmail that he asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while
two of the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a
level of power that is truly terrifying!
