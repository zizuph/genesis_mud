210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 28

Burning Hells! To my shock and horror - MOTHER has gone with the host of
attackers! I was barely able to recognize her as she emerged from our home
in full female elven-plate armour. She strode into the company, and her eyes
contained such a terrible purpose, that none questioned her for an instant,
but immediately (and gladly) accepted her as one of the chief commanders in
the effort. This is not the mother that I have known - I had no idea she
was trained in this way. But then again, I have only lived for the blink of
an eye in her long life. Silvette did not appear surprised at all. I could
tell that there was no use in objecting to her plans, and so when mother
offered me her final embrace before departing, all I could do was to hold her
tightly for what I hope not to be the last time.
