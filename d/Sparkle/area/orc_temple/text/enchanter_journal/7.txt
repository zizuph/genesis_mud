210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 5

Today, I confronted mother, and would not be dismissed. After initial long
periods of silence, I was finally allowed to know a portion of her mind. She
revealed to me that toward the end of Summer she was awoken from her
meditations by a horror unlike anything she had felt in her long life. She
spoke of a fathomless power of evil with insatiable hunger that she felt sure
had somehow come to know of this world. There was something beyond this that
clearly troubled her, but when I pressed her for answers, she only wept
bitterly, and would not speak more of it. I have never seen her shed tears
before, and I cannot imagine what this must mean.
