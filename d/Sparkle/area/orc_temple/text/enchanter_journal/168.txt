219th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 15

Today, a goblin named Raxton brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic light steel greaves that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of
the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are
quite above normal!
