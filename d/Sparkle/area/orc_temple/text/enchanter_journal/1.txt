210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 3

The snows have melted now, and Shalewood is preparing for the Spring Festival
in earnest. My sister has told me of the disappearance of old Bertram, who
lived on the outskirts of the woods. His regular deliveries of eggs and honey
to the market had not been seen for two weeks, so Harstaff went to pay him a
visit and found the farm derelict, with half-starved livestock and no sign of
Bertram and his sons. Harstaff felt the barnyard showed signs of a struggle,
but did not find any conclusive evidence. Silvette claims to have felt the 
presence of the Fallen Race, and is certain there is a connection. I have felt 
no such presence, but my sister will always have the advantage of pure elven 
blood. Mother, as usual, remains silent on the matter.
