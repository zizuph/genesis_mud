219th Year of the Fifth Cycle, May 28

Today, an elf named Valandil brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic elven chainmail that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while two of
the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a level of
power that is truly terrifying!
