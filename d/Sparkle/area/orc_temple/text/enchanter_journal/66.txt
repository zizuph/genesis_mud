214th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 10

Today, a half-elf named Creed brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic chainmail hood that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of
the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are
quite above normal!
