213th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 27

Today, a goblin named Hades brought in an outrageously rare find. The
exotic black helmet that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three imbuements
are of different levels of power. One is the standard level, one is quite
above normal, and the other is terrifying!
