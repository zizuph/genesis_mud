219th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 13

Today, a human named Diri brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
dwarven steel chainmail that she asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while two of
the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a level of
power that is truly terrifying!
