212th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 12

Today, a human named Freya brought in an outrageously rare find. The exotic
black two-handed sword that she asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three imbuements
are of different levels of power. One is the standard level, one is quite
above normal, and the other is terrifying!
