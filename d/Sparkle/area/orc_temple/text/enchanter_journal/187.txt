220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 1

Today, a goblin named Saimon brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic broken blackened mithril lance that he asked me to transmogrify
contained three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact
that while one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of
the others are quite above normal!
