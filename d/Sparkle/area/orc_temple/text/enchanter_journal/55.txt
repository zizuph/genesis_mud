213th Year of the Fifth Cycle, August 3

Today, a hobbit named Bethelissa brought in an outrageously rare find. The
exotic strong iron helm that she asked me to disenchant contained three
separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three imbuements
are of different levels of power. One is the standard level, one is quite
above normal, and the other is terrifying!
