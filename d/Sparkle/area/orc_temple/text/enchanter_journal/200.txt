220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, November 15

Today, a wisp named Garwain brought in an outrageously rare find. The
exotic broken light warped handaxe that he asked me to transmogrify
contained three separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all
three imbuements are of different levels of power. One is the standard
level, one is quite above normal, and the other is terrifying!
