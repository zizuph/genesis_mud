210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 12

Damn the Orcs! Today, less than two dozen of our party returned, most badly
wounded, and all beset by a grim madness! To my great relief, Mother was
among them, but she is by no means well. We were able to tend to her physical
wounds, and she will almost certainly recover from these in due time. But
there is a kind of horror and wild despair in her eyes that I cannot see
beyond, and she seems too afflicated to speak. Silvette and I are working
with all the skill we possess to minister to her needs.
