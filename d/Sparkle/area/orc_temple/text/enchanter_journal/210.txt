221st Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 7

Today, a goblin named Cassius brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic broken bright yellow pair of leggings that he asked me to
transmogrify contained three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes
from the fact that while one of the imbuements is of the standard level of
power, both of the others are quite above normal!
