213th Year of the Fifth Cycle, December 16

Today, a half-elf named Ydred brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic broken studded leather armour that he asked me to transmogrify
contained three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact
that while one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of
the others are quite above normal!
