211th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 12

Today, a gnome named Enigma brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
rough metal shield that he asked me to identify contained three separate
imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of the
imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are quite
above normal!
