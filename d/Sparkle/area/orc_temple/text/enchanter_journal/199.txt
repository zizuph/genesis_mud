220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, October 1

Today, a dwarf named Tor brought in an exceedingly rare find. The exotic
stone club that he asked me to transmogrify contained three separate
imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of the
imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are quite
above normal!
