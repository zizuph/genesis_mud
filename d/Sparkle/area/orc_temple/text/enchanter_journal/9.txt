210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 27

A week has passed with the elves, and it seems all are agreed on the path that
must be taken. An attack has been planned on a great Orc Fortress that is
known to exist far to the northeast near the City of Sparkle. It is there that
the Seers have felt their minds attuned most clearly to the horror of which
they speak. Tomorrow at dawn, a host of more than 100 elves and men will
embark on the five day journey to that place.
