220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, May 7

Today, a drow named Nellnight brought in a nearly unheard-of find! The
exotic broken ghostly veil that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. What is so fascinating is that an imbuement of
standard power is joined here by not one, but two imbuements of truly
terrifying power!
