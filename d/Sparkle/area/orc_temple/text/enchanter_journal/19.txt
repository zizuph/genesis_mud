210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 18

Silvette and I have begun to prepare for the challenge before us. Hers is
the magic of Seeing and the Mind - an art I have never been able to master
beyond the most basic steps. Likewise, she is unskilled in enchantment. But
together, Mother felt our powers could be combined to destroy the link the
demon has with this world. We have much preparation to do, and an unknown
amount of time before my brother comes to call.
