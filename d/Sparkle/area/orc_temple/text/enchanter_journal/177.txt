219th Year of the Fifth Cycle, September 30

Today, a drow named Amberlee brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic pair of heavy iron boots that she asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while
two of the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a
level of power that is truly terrifying!
