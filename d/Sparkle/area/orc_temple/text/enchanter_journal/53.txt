213th Year of the Fifth Cycle, May 21

Today, a half-elf named Creed brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic pair of leather gauntlets that he asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact that while
two of the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the third has a
level of power that is truly terrifying!
