217th Year of the Fifth Cycle, June 29

Today, a wraith named Ethuscuel brought in an outrageously rare find. The
exotic broken gold morgul platemail that he asked me to transmogrify
contained three separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all
three imbuements are of different levels of power. One is the standard
level, one is quite above normal, and the other is terrifying!
