215th Year of the Fifth Cycle, January 2

Today, a goblin named Manglor brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic smelly iron chainmail that he asked me to disenchant contained three
separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of
the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are
quite above normal!
