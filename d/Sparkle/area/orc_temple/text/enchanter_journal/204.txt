221st Year of the Fifth Cycle, January 4

Today, a minotaur named Zhabou brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic long sharp dagger that she asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while one of
the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others are
quite above normal!
