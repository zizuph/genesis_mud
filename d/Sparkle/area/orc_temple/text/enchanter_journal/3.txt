210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, March 12

Today was the Spring Festival. Bertram's absence was strangely palpable. His
many flavours of honey are a favorite of the festival every year, and there
was much talk of what has become of him. To add to this, the Sarpenthal
family was unexpectedly absent, leaving the horse-training tournament bereft
of nearly a quarter of its expected entries. Following the festival,
Harstaff took a few of his men to call upon the Sarpenthal ranch to make sure
all is well.
