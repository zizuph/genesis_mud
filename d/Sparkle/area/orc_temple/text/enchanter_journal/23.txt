211th Year of the Fifth Cycle, February 18

The Magistrate of Sparkle has welcomed me into the city, and I have purchased
a derelict structure in the northern parts of the Old Town. Using a great
deal of mercurystone, I have made quick work of the place, and it is now
servicable for my purposes.

I have opened my shop for business, and the business is brisk indeed. I
will now use this journal to keep a record of the more interesting items
that are brought to me by my customers.
