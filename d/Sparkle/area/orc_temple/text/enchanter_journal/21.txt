210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 22

It has come to pass just as Mother spoke. This morning, Kerchak entered the
Shalewood and called upon Silvette and I. There is no question about it - he
is utterly changed. There was never great love between my brother and I, but
the demon has torn his mind, and he is clearly not the same person at all.
He spoke with a simpering humility, feigning sorrow, regret, and the need
for help. His performance was not even remotely convincing, but Silvette and
I did as well as we could to act as if it was. To make it seem as if we are
not too strangely eager to go with him, we have told him that we need the
night to speak together to decide on our course of action. In the morning, we
will accompany him back to the Orc Fortress, and make our best attempt at the
plan. I pray that we will not both be destroyed as Mother was.

This will be my final entry in the journal until the ordeal is over. I dare
not risk it being found by Kerchak, lest he know of our plans.
