220th Year of the Fifth Cycle, May 11

Today, a goblin named Cassius brought in a nearly unheard-of find! The
exotic broken battered seax that he asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. What is so fascinating is that an imbuement of
standard power is joined here by not one, but two imbuements of truly
terrifying power!
