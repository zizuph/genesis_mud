212th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 19

Today, a goblin named Bromen brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic antique mother-of-pearl short sword that he asked me to transmogrify
contained three separate imbuements. What is most surprising is the fact
that while two of the imbuements are of the standard level of power, the
third has a level of power that is truly terrifying!
