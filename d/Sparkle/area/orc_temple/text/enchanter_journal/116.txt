216th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 10

Today, a wraith named Emraht brought in an outrageously rare find. The
exotic curved orc scimitar that he asked me to transmogrify contained three
separate imbuements. Stranger still is the fact that all three imbuements
are of different levels of power. One is the standard level, one is quite
above normal, and the other is terrifying!
