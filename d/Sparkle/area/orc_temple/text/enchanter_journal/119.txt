216th Year of the Fifth Cycle, July 7

Today, a hobbit named Johnny brought in an exceedingly rare find. The
exotic pair of spiked boots that it asked me to transmogrify contained
three separate imbuements. The rarity here comes from the fact that while
one of the imbuements is of the standard level of power, both of the others
are quite above normal!
