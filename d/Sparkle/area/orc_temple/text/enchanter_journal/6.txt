210th Year of the Fifth Cycle, April 2

The reports have come back from the elves to the southeast. Their losses
would seem to have been far worse than our own. Entire villages of the
elves seeming to vanish overnight, with telltale signs of orc-involvement
strewn about the village - but no bodies! Harstaff has sent representetives
to the Fair Peoples to coordinate a response to this ongoing threat. Mother
has almost entirely withdrawn. I grow deeply concerned.
