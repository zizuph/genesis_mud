| Genesis Tutorial Chapter 22: Using Weapons                                | |
|                                                                           | |
| Weapons are one of the most important things you can own in Genesis as    | |
| they make a huge difference in the amount of damage you can deal in       | |
| combat. They are often available for purchase in shops, but can also be   | |
| fairly easily found by killing enemies and taking their loot. Obviously,  | |
| the more skill you have trained in a certain weapon type, the more damage | |
| you do with that kind of weapon. Once you own a weapon, you can use these | |
| commands:                                                                 | |
|                                                                           | |
|   <wield>    - Equip the weapon for combat. Some weapons are designed to  | |
|                be wielded in just one hand, while others will require two.| |
|   <unwield>  - Unequip the weapon you are currently wielding.             | |
|   <appraise> - Display the properties of a weapon, and try to judge its   | |
|                value. Do <help appraise> for more details.                | |
|   <compare>  - Using this command you can sometimes get useful insight    | |
|                into which of two weapons is better. Beware, however, that | |
|                low skill levels in "appraise object" can result in very   | |
|                wrong information when you use <compare>. When in doubt,   | |
|                the more expensive weapon is typically the best. (note:    | |
|                you can't compare weapons listed in the shop, only those   | |
|                in your inventory or on the ground.)                       | |
|                                                                           | |
| Warning: Wielding two weapons at the same time REDUCES your effectiveness | |
|          in combat unless you have two-handed combat skill, which is not  | |
|          offered in the tutorial.                                         | |
| Also:    Know that at beginner levels, unarmed combat tends to do more    | |
|          damage than low-level weapons. It is recommended that you max    | |
|          your unarmed combat skill and fight without wielding anything at | |
|          first.                                                           | |
