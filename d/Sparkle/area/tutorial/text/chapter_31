| Genesis Tutorial Chapter 31: Save, Armageddon, and Recovery               | |
|                                                                           | |
| Saving is an important thing to do if you have just done something in the | |
| game that you feel is important and needs to be immediately saved to disk.| |
| Typically, it is a good idea to type <save> when you complete a quest.    | |
|                                                                           | |
| The room you are standing in is a special room for your race that can be  | |
| selected as a start location. There are a few special circumstances about | |
| start locations that are worth noting. Once in a while, a being named     | |
| Armageddon will restart the game. When he does, you will be forced to log | |
| out after a short period of time. Armageddon will give you the option to  | |
| be teleported back to your start location when he arrives. From your      | |
| start location, you can use the <save> command for another purpose. In    | |
| your start location typing <save> will give you a list of which items in  | |
| your inventory are "glowing." Glowing items will stay with you if you     | |
| type <quit> when you are at your start location. Then, when you log       | |
| back in, you will recover the glowing items that were in                  | |
| your inventory when you quit. Be sure to sell any non-glowing items       | |
| before you quit to get some much-needed money.                            | |
|                                                                           | |
|   <start here>    - set this room to be your start location from now on.  | |
|   <save>          - Save to disk your current character. If typed from a  | |
|                     start location, print a list of your glowing items.   | |
|   <help recover>  - Get comprehensive information on item recovery.       | |
|   <help armageddon> Get comprehensive information on Armageddon.          | |
