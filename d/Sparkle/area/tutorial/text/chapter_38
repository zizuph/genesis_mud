| Genesis Tutorial Chapter 38: Herbs                                        | |

| Herbs are one of the most useful things in the entire game. Though small  | |
| and unobtrusive, they offer benefits beyond count to those who take the   | |
| time to harvest them. Not only does finding herbs give you general        | |
| experience to increase your statistics, but herbs (like coins) remain in  | |
| your inventory over multiple logins. To successfully find herbs, you will | |
| need to first spend some money training your herbalism skill back in town.| |
|                                                                           | |
| Throughout Genesis, many outdoor rooms are the sorts of places that herbs | |
| like to grow. To see if there are any herbs that you can find in a room,  | |
| you can <search here for herbs>. You might find something! If you do, you | |
| will find a herb that is described by its general appearance. Only by     | |
| using the <exa> command can you get more information on what you might    | |
| have harvested. If your herbalism skill is high enough, you might get     | |
| detailed information on the specifics of the herb. Some herbs have        | |
| helpful properties, while others might harm you. Herbs may be eaten just  | |
| like any other kind of food. But beware! If you do not know what you are  | |
| eating, you might find yourself not liking the result.                    | |
|                                                                           | |
| Herbs tend to grow in the same places over and over again. If you found   | |
| a certain type of herb in one room, you might be able to find it there    | |
| again. If your herbalism skill is high enough, you might even be able to  | |
| search for that specific herb (e.g. <search here for herbname>).          | |
