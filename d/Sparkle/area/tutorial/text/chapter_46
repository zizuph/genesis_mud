| Genesis Tutorial Chapter 46: Grinding - A Necessary Evil?                 | |
|                                                                           | |
| You might be wondering a few things about now. Why do I suck so much at   | |
| combat? Why can't I swim across the river? Why do fights take so long?    | |
| These questions can all be answered simply by stating that your skills    | |
| need to be trained. To do this, you will need money, and *lots* of it.    | |
| The tutorial is designed to give you a feel for what it is really like to | |
| play Genesis. A huge part of the game when you start out is training your | |
| skills higher. With better skills, everything becomes easier and you are  | |
| able to achieve your goals faster.                                        | |
|                                                                           | |
| Basically, this means grinding. Grinding is the practice of killing things| |
| in a certain area over and over, collecting their loot, selling it,       | |
| training your skills higher, and repeating the process. As you do so, you | |
| get the added benefit of improving your statistics, which also play a big | |
| role in combat. The most powerful players in the game have spent a vast   | |
| amount of time grinding to get their skills and stats higher.             | |
|                                                                           | |
| You may have noticed that you seem to fight worse with a weapon. This is  | |
| actually true at low levels! It is recommended that you first grind your  | |
| way up to maxing out your "unarmed combat" and "defence" skills, which    | |
| will then make it far easier to earn money for the skills you need like   | |
| "swim" and "climb" to advance to more areas in the Tutorial. Later on you | |
| might want to switch over to a weapon-based combat skill.                 | |
