| Genesis Tutorial Chapter 8: Statistics & Racial Abilities                 | |
|                                                                           | |
| Statistics or <stats> are used to determine how successful you are at     | |
| many different things. Below is a short summary of what the six stats     | |
| mainly affect:                                                            | |
|                                                                           | |
|   Strength:     How hard you hit and how much you can carry.              | |
|   Dexterity:    How easily you score and avoid hits in combat.            | |
|   Constitution: How much damage you can take before you die (hitpoints).  | |
|                 Also determines how much you can eat and drink.           | |
|   Intelligence: How potent your spells are and how big your mana          | |
|                 pool is (spellpoints).                                    | |
|   Wisdom:       How potent your spells are and how quickly you            | |
|                 regenerate mana.                                          | |
|   Discipline:   How good you are at hitting with and avoiding spells.     | |
|                 Also determines which enemies you dare attack.            | |
|                                                                           | |
| The different races in Genesis are all equal when it comes to stats,      | |
| however, their different racial abilities set them apart. Here, in the    | |
| library, you can <exa>mine each statue to get a sense of how each race    | |
| in Genesis is distinct. To learn more about races and racial abilities,   | |
| please check out <help races>.                                            | |
|                                                                           | |
| The priest of regrowth here can help you change your body, which means    | |
| that you get to reselect your race, gender, racial abilities, and how     | |
| you look. Simply <ask priest change> to start the process. In the         | |
| tutorial this is done without penalty, but once you leave the tutorial,   | |
| changes like this require dying. Death will take experience from you,     | |
| and choosing a new body outside of the tutorial will also cause you to    | |
| lose half of your skills.                                                 | |
