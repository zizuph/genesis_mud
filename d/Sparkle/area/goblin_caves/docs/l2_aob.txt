Hi

I am finishing a new area in Sparkle.

There are two items that I want to approve in sense of balancing:

Lets start with more simple item.
I have very deadly spider in my area.
Size: 250+random(50) in every stat.
Specials: depends on random, it may have poison, stun or damage special.
It also blocks exit.
Sounds like a dead trap. But there is a easy way out: player can cut web and spider will fall into water.

After killing this spider. Player may tear two mandibles from corpse.
I want to make it poisonous dagger:
Hit/pen: 35+random(5)
3 poisons for 20 strength time 60 interval 10. (I'd love your advice if it is not too weak).


Second item is magic resistance amulet
I have some shamans in the area. Shamans have a aura that block hits that are coming from player of specific alignment:
Black aura -> no damage from evil players.
Grey aura -> no damage from neutral players. (-400..400)
White aura -> no damage from good players.

Main shaman has aura that blocks hits from all players of the same alignment as tanking player.
That will require team of two players that have different alignments.

Main shaman will have an amulet with following perks:
The amulet provides resistance according to gem inserted.
The gem dissolves after some time and amulet starts to shine
After amulet stops to shine, player will be able to insert another gem
If no gem inserted for some time, amulet itself will dissolve

Times:
From gem inserted to warning about dissolve: 2:50 hours
From warning to gem dissolve: 0:10
From gem dissolve to light is out: 1:00
from light is out to amulet dissolve: 2:00

Gems and resistances:
I think it is easier to explain it by code:
		if(gems[gem_index] == "ruby" && (prop == MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE || prop ==  MAGIC_I_RES_LIFE))
			return ({ 30, 1 });
		if(gems[gem_index] == "sapphire" && (prop == MAGIC_I_RES_COLD || prop ==  MAGIC_I_RES_WATER))
			return ({ 30, 1 });
		if(gems[gem_index] == "emerald" && (prop == MAGIC_I_RES_POISON || prop ==  MAGIC_I_RES_ACID))
			return ({ 30, 1 });
		if(gems[gem_index] == "diamond" && (prop == MAGIC_I_RES_DEATH || prop ==  MAGIC_I_RES_AIR))
			return ({ 30, 1 });
		if(gems[gem_index] == "topaz" && (prop == MAGIC_I_RES_ELECTRICITY || prop ==  MAGIC_I_RES_EARTH))
			return ({ 30, 1 });

Probably should add illusion and identify but I am not sure that these are used (maybe alexandrite)

I don't want to have this item cloned as unique because it fades away in six hours if left in racks.

I'd like to have your opinion on these times, power and gem/resistance mapping
