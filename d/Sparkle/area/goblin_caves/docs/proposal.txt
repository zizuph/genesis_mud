Hi

This proposal for change of Sparkle goblin caves

Overview
Goblin caves is small rarely visited area that need reinnovation.
My idea is to create multi-level area that will be challenging to 
many levels of mortals: from newbies to teams of myths.

Story
Goblins are back to caves near Sparkle and reinnoviting their caves.
There is a rumour goblin king is gathering an army to attack Sparkle
and Faerie.

Main purpose of first level
First level of goblin caves will be area where low levels can 
sharpen their combat skills on small skilless goblins.
Also area will contain small quest.

Layout of first level:
    |
a-b-c h k-l~m
  |   | | |
d-e-f-g~i-j  
  |
  
a - sleeping room
b - board room
c - Entrance to level 2. There is a door that will be open when 
knocked after three conditions done: Below mentioned quest done
and mortal level of apprentice.
d - storage room
e - entrance room
f - bare corridor
g - training adventure guild
h - shop
i,j,k,l - goblin training cave
m - goblin leader level 1
"-" - obvious exit
"~" - hidden exit

Population:
About 10 easy goblins in caves
12 a bit tougher goblins in training cave
Goblin leader - bigger mob with weak special and probably decent
non-magic sword/armour
  
Quests of first level
Find lost armour 
Quest master: Goblin trainer
Reward: minor XP, 1 platinum coin
Story:
Goblin trainer (room g) lost his armour somewhere in caves.
Armour will be in one of following locations:
chest near beds in sleeping room (room a)
crates in storage room (room d)
under a table of goblin leader (room m)
Once quest is done at least once per reboot trainer will be
able to train defence skill to superior layman.

Challenge measurement
novice - impossibly hard
beginner, Cadet - challenge
wanderer, Cadet - easy

Future extensions
Level two will be done for mortals: apprentice -> great 
adventurer
Level three will be done for mortals: great adventurer -> hero
Level four will be done for mortals: hero -> legend
Level five will be a challenge for team of two-three myths
