GENESIS TO SPARKLE MOVE (TECHNICAL)
-----------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to outline the technical issues
that need to be solved to get the Sparkle domain up and running.

07/12/09 Arandir        Polished to see where things stand


o Preloading

  There are some rooms preloaded in /d/Genesis in preload.c,
  preload.data and domain_link.c. This needs to be checked
  and adjusted as necessary.


o Boards

  Boards need to be moved. Unlike code, boards get updated,
  which means they need to be moved fast. Also, MBS needs
  to be updated.

  - Some boards are not of our concern
    as they are not in our rooms:

    - COMMON BOARD
        /d/Genesis/obj/board
    - TOWER ENTRANCE BOARD
    - TOWER ADVANCED BOARD
    - TOWER WIZAPP BOARD
    - TOWER IDEAS BOARD

  - Some boards we might want to check:

    - PLAYERARCH OFFICE BOARD
    - DONATION OFFICE BOARD

  - Some boards certainly need moving:

    - DWARFHEIM BOARD


o Quests

  Quest bits must be copied. There are quests in Sparkle,
  quests in Faerie, guru quest for Monks. Mrpr agreed to help.

  A list of quests is kept in open/BITS.

  Special macros have been coded that allow porting of quest
  bits, see the QUEST_PORT definitions in sys/quests.h. All
  quest bits should be handled using macros !


o Players

  Saving items
  Souls and shadows
  Starting locations

  Need to be moved in player files.

  Probably grepping through the player files and
  then creating a set of rewrite rules should work.

  Movers for rooms, objects, shadows have been coded, see lib/mover.


o Databases

  Some O files save object or function names that include paths. This
  has to be checked, luckily there are not so many O files involved.

  Since all guilds have been moved and the Tower of Realms is not
  included in the move, this is probably done as well ...


o Links

  A grep across all domains for inherited or included code should be done.

  Several places are known to connect from the outside:

   - Events Mvsevm
   - Dragon Army Dragon Landing
   - Pretty Much All Ships That Exist
