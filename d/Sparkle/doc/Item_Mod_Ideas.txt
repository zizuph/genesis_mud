Random Weapon/Armour Modification Ideas:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These ideas are my proposal for going about implementing a random element of
to the normal weapon drops in the game. 

  - When cloned, there is a 1% chance that any weapon or armour will have
    mods added to them. If this happens, there is a 10% chance that the
    weapon will have an additional second mod. If this happens there is a
    further 10% chance that the weapon will have a third and final mod.
    We do not allow more than 3 mods. But, the chance that a weapon will
    clone with three mods is quite low:

        with 1 mod  = 1 in 100 items
        with 2 mods = 1 in 1000 items
        with 3 mods = 1 in 10000 items

  - I don't have a good way to actually add the mods. Shadows probably?
    I'll let the code gurus thinktank this issue.

  - Many mods will be of the type that will allow weak/average/strong
    quality. So, we will use this as much as possible. For example,
    if the mod adds poison resistance to the user:

        weak    = 10% resistance
        average = 20% resistance
        strong  = 30% resistance

    We should find a way to set the potency of the mod in the standard
    code (function?) that is used when a mod is added.

  - Mods will each have a unique subloc that they add to the description
    of the item. This will allow players to know they have found something
    with a mod on it at a glance. It will also allow people to build up a
    database of what the various sublocs mean. For example:

        "You notice that it is emitting a low-pitched ringing sound."
        "You notice that it is emitting a dull ringing sound."
        "You notice that it is emitting a high-pitched ringing sound."

    These are potential descriptors to describe weak/average/strong
    sublocs added when something is cloned with a mod that does double
    damage to gnomes.

List of potential mods:

  - Human hating (double-damage)
