Description: Tier 5 spell
                 Targets: 1 weapon
		 Temporarily enchants the chosen weapon with the
		 power of fire. The downside to using this is that, if
		 the caster wishes to fight with this weapon, he will
		 lose most of his effectiveness as a caster as all
		 offensive spells require that the caster have both
		 hands empty.

Requirements:
    SS_ELEMENT_EARTH
    SS_FORM_ENCHANTMENT
    Dagger
