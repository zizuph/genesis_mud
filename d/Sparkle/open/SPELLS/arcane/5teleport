Description: Tier 5 spell
                 Targets: N/A
		 This spell is used to transport the caster back to the
		 Seeker's guild hall. It is a fickle and unreliable spell at
		 best. It can be cast from anywhere, but the results
		 are varied, and sometime dangerous. The caster may
		 end up transported right to the very entrance of the
		 guild, or to various locations in the Sparkle domain if
		 he is powerful and lucky. However, there is a chance
		 that the caster will only transport himself to some
		 other location within the lands from which he is casting,
		 or may even be transported a completely different
		 domain! He may even find that he fails miserably and
		 is transported no where. For any cast, failure or
		 success, there is a chance that the caster will have
		 his life force drained from him, most likely more so
		 with a grievous failure.
