Description: Tier 5 spell
                 Targets: N/A
		 This is a damaging and stunning spell. This spell is
		 very inaccurate, and as such, the caster is unable
		 to target any specific enemy. Rather, the spell calls
		 forth an earthquake that damages and stuns (briefly)
		 anyone within the immediate area of the caster (in
		 the same room), that includes any enemies, _and_
	         friends or bystanders. Can not be cast outside of
		 combat.

Requirements:
    SS_ELEMENT_EARTH
