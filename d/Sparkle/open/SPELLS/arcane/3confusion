Description: Tier 3 spell
                 Targets: 1, specified target required
		 Makes the target confused. Creates a spell effect
		 object in the target, which, for a short duration of
		 time, causes the target to randomly perform actions
		 from a list of predefined actions. This will not be
		 nearly as extreme as the old Mystic version, where
		 players might have been invoked to 'drop all'. The
		 actions would range from 'drop <random number> item'
		 to 'eat/drink all' to walking in spurts of random
		 directions, to speaking/shouting random phrases and
		 performing random emotes.
