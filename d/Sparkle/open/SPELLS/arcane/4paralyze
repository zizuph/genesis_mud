Description: Tier 4 spell
                 Targets: 1, unspecified defaults to current enemy (if
		              currently in combat)
		 Stuns the target for a brief period of time with a 'shock'
		 from lightning. After getting over the initial shock of being
		 struck, the target is somewhat dazed, meaning that their
		 combat speed has been reduced. Clones a spell effect
		 object in the target that adds the stun prop. After the
		 duration of the stun is over, removes the stun prop and
		 temporarily reduces speed.
