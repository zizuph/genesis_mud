Description: Tier 0 spell (default)
                 Targets: N/A
		 Has a chance of detecting any non-obvious exits
                 from the caster's current room. Sometimes it reports
		 all non-obvious exits, sometimes not all, sometimes
		 not any. For any case, the caster is not informed if
		 the result really means they have found the all of
		 the exits (if any). Example: standing in a room that
		 has 3 non-obvious exits, the caster might see any
		 number of them, or none, but if any are shown, they
		 would see: "You sense that it might be possible to
		 travel south and east from here."
		 Also, for some castings, it might not only fail to
		 detect, it might report non-existing exits.
