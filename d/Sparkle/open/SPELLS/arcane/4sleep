Description: Tier 4 spell
                 Targets: N/A
		 Causes the caster to fall asleep, increasing the
		 rengeration rates of health, fatigue and mana. The
		 amount of sleep time is variable, and the cost of mana
		 for casting the spell is rather high, so there is a chance
		 that the caster will in fact lose mana as a result of
		 this spell. This spell can not be cast in combat, and the
		 caster, once asleep, can not move or use any commands.
		 If the caster is attacked, the regen benefits cease, and
		 the caster becomes essentially 'stunned' until they fully
		 wake up.
