Refresh proposal
================

This is a refresh proposal based upon the assumption that players will travel
to Sparkle, when the city functions as a game hub, in order to refresh their
tired bodies. I do not take into account the possible artefacts, healing
magic, healing guilds or other healing facilities or places that may exist
elsewhere in the game. This is just about Sparkle and only a proposal to get
our minds spinning. ;)

Cheers, Styles.

Healing, refreshing or regeneration of any kind may be divided
into three categories.

 1. Portable healing.
 2. Stationary healing.
 3. Stationary restoration.




1. Portable healing
===================

Gained by: Misc types of alcohol, potions, herbs, pills etc.

Affects: Hitpoints and/or Mana.


Pro: Cheap, readily available.
Con: Encumbering, low efficiency.


Notes:
These portable items can readily be bought in pubs, magic shops, from
herbalists or any type of similar establishment. You can bring your
beer with you and drink it when the need or craving arise.




2. Stationary healing
=====================

Gained by: Praying in church, tended to by NPC.

Affects: Hitpoints and/or Mana

Pro: Free at low levels, Cheap at mid levels, High efficiency.
Con: Expensive at higher levels, Once per hour, Ceremony takes ~90 seconds. 


Notes:
A good way to keep the newbies alive at no charge. A affordable way for the
mid level players to refresh themselves, and for the high level players
(who would have to drink barrels of beer) it is a very time efficient way
to get those points back. A risk however is that fewer will sit down for
a few pints in the pub. The sanctity and peace of mind gained by donating
a heartily sum to charity is also not to be forgotten.




3. Stationary restoration
=========================

Gained by: Specialist care somewhere in Sparkle.

Affects: Combat stats, Fatigue, Panic value, Luck, Poison, Jinxes and Curses.


Pro: Efficient. Unique service. Rare bonuses.
Con: Very Expensive. Once per game day. Not always advertised.


Notes:
Very specific specialist treatments. A few treatments are standard but
some may be submitted by the domains. If one domain code a curse of some
kind, they may also submit to the hub team how to get rid of it.
The specialist might also be able to do some surgical improvements but
at a almost unaffordable price. Such an improvement could be kept until
the next reboot and the cost could be relative the real game time left.
