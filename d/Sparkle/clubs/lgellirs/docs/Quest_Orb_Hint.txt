(Minor - The Fire and the Folk -- Gellirs of Lars Introduction Quest)

You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, concentrating deeply as
you do so. You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black
orb. Like stepping out of a portal, you find yourself present in a dense forest
of ash trees. You are free from thought, innocent of deed, cold and naked and
surrounded by many like you. There is a flash... which comes and goes inside a
heartbeat... but leaves behind a bright dancing thing. You and those around you
gather to it. Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a
jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
