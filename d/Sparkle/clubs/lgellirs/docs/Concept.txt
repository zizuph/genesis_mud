====CONCEPT===================================================================

----------------------------------------------------
CONCEPT DOCUMENT for a CLUB by Vitwitch, August 2022
----------------------------------------------------

----NAMES:

The Gellirs of Lars
Larsgellirs

----NOTE: 

This is a much simplified concept based on the ILLUMINATED of LARS
proposal put forward by Vitwitch in September 2021. That club concept
is abandoned as being too complex for actual game-play in practice.

----GOALS: 

1. Provide an alternate growth activity to combat alone, that rewards 
   wide exploration, discovery and appreciation of the room and
   room item descriptions already in existence.

2. Give more agency to new and/or smaller players -- who prioritise
   roleplay over 'power playing'.

3. To exploit the inherent word-based play environment of Genesis; in
   contrast to games based in video environments.

4. To *not* affect skills, ability and guild balance *at all* -- to be
   open to all without limitation.

5. To weave into backstory a narrative reason behind the game-mechanic of
   player-characters always returning after death -- making a narrative
   distinction between player-characters and non-player characters.

----JOINING REQUIREMENTS:

None. All races, guilds, sizes and alignments are welcome.

Players can join and leave the club as many times as they wish
without penalty. Accumulated unclaimed benefits remain in place
even if a player leaves the club. They can be redeemed if the
player chooses to rejoin.

----PREMISE:

LARS is sometimes called The Implementor... (eg. /d/Genesis/std/death_room.c)
players typically only come across him in death... he is all powerful but 
it is notoriously hard to otherwise attract his attention... so....

The Larsgellirs muse upon words found in Lars's works of Creation to form
and bind chants (galdrar) to their essence. When they die, these galdrar
can be yelled in the hearing of Lars to attract his attention and
favour.

By finding and using words of power (kraftords) of particular rarity, they
give their galdrar greater ability to attract the attention and favour of
Lars. At the end of each Armageddon cycle, Lars chooses the Gellir who
caught his attention most effectively and for the longest time and grants
them a great boon of creative growth (experience points).

----ABILITIES and BENEFITS:

1. No skills or combat abilities of any kind are provided.

2. Gellirs have the ability to <muse> words from room and room-item
   descriptions. These words, and only these words, can be used to
   <form> a simple magical chant (galdr) involving formatted text and ascii
   art (if desired, without game effect) -- all of the player's choosing.
   A gellir can <bind> such a chant to themselves, so that when they
   next die, this chant can be <yell>ed in the hearing of Lars.

3. The effectiveness of the bound galdr depends on the rareness of the 
   <muse>d adjectives and how early before Armageddon it was heard. Rareness
   changes dynamically with use and non-use by gellirs from one Armageddon
   to the next -- encouraging a continual search for fresh words to create
   more effective bound galdrar. Those gellirs who participate more actively
   will be better aware of the current state of rareness of <muse>d adjectives,
   and will have the associated galdrar heard earlier to accumulate a higher
   effectiveness score.

4. Each Gellir who <yell>s in extremis in the hearing of Lars, is eligible
   to be granted a prize (boon) of general experience after the Armageddon
   in which the hearing occurred. This boon is the total of all combat/general
   experience lost by all gellirs heard since the previous Armageddon. The 
   gellir with the highest effectiveness score wins this boon and is
   notified by mail to redeem it in a special club-room (the Larsether).
   When a gellir redeems a boon as general experience it is increased to
   offset the gellir's guild taxes -- the rationale being that tax has
   already been paid on all the lost experience that makes up the boon. 

5. Passage through the special club-room, the Larsether, provides the
   experience bonus, full recovery of mana, health and fatigue, a snapshot
   of the adjectives (only the adjectives) of all the players awake at the
   time, a unique magic-map experience, and a splash-down at a random
   location in Sparkle harbour. 

6. All (3) club locations are non-teleport, non-blocking, non-scrying
   outside rooms. One of these rooms is also open to non-members, and is
   the destination of an introductory quest.  

----TAX / COSTS / GAMING:

1. There is no direct tax on experience.

2. However, each Larsgellir must die for their Larsgaldr to be in the hearing of
   Lars and so be eligible to win the boon at the next Armageddon. In effect,
   each gellir is wagering the experience cost of that death against that
   of all other gellirs heard in the same period.

3. All but one Larsgellir will *not* win the experience boon. So the cost in
   experience is usually significant.

4. Obviously, players who choose to aggressively pursue wins as a Larsgellir
   will die more frequently. They will tend to be both smaller and more aware
   of the current state of rareness of words than players who seldom
   participate.

5. All large players will likely become Larsgellirs and <bind> galdrar so
   that they have a chance of winning and not losing as much combat/general
   experience if they happen to die involuntarily -- like an insurance policy.
   However, these players will not know the current state of rareness of the
   words which go into Larsgaldrar (except perhaps through small seconds) and
   will not likely have died early in the cycle to accumulate a competitive
   effectiveness score.

6. Still, even infrequent Larsgellirs who die, with a bound Larsgaldr, have
   a chance of winning the boon and mitigating the cost of involuntary
   death and experience loss.

7. More often, the death of infrequent (large sized) Larsgellirs will swell
   the experience point prize (boon) pool won by a devoted (small sized)
   Larsgellir.

8. The extreme archetype of a Larsgellir is a player with much quest
   experience (but with many many scars and not much accumulated
   combat/general experience) who fearlessly explores the big wide world.
   Such a player likely has a considerable pool of unclaimed boon points
   that they are saving (subject to 5% decay Arma-on-Arma) until they
   retire from active Larsgelling. Perhaps if they win big one Armageddon
   they may claim all their boons, grow big and go do other things... or not.

----GOVERNANCE:

There is no Council. All club functions, including all galdrar judging, are
fully automated.

Larsgellirs are, in effect, in friendly competition with one another.

----DEVELOPMENTAL STATUS:

All code and supporting documentation has been written.
It has been comprehensively alpha-tested as of 5th August 2022.


====REFERENCE MATERIAL=========================================================

see separate FIRE_AND_FOLK backstory file

----MECHANICS:

1. Club members (GELLIRS) use their club object (LARSREYKR) to <muse> upon
   words from room and room-item descriptions in the rest of the game,
   collecting them for later use.

2. They use these collected words to form magical chants (GALDRAR) which
   are bound to their essence and are yelled into the hearing of Lars in
   the after-death-before-life place (called Extermis by gellirs). Only
   <mused> collected words can be used. It is not enough to know a words
   exists, it must be found.  Word collecting (<musing>) is like a normal
   search in duration, and appears as such to onlookers.

3. Immediately after death, between Death and returning to life, GELLIRs
   <yell> their bound GALDR in the hearing of Lars, borne on their LARSREYKR.

4. At the end of each Arma cycle, all heard GALDRAR are compared in terms
   of POWER x TIME. POWER is determined by the rarity of the rarest adjective
   (kraftord) in each galdr and TIME is the length of time between the 
   hearing of the galdr and Armageddon. The Gellir with the greatest
   POWER x TIME score is the winner.

5. That Gellir is awarded a 'boon' of points equal to the pool of non-quest
   experience points lost by all Gellirs heard in that Arma cycle. This boon
   can be redeemed at any time as general experience. The boon DOES NOT need
   to be redeemed immediately. Awarded boon points accumulate if they are not
   redeemed as experience. Unredeemed boon points decay at a rate of 5%
   per Armageddon cycle.

6. Active Larsgellirs will die a lot (in order to be heard early and with 
   powerful galdrar) over successive Arma cycles and so pretty quickly will
   only be losing general experience equal to what they have amassed in a
   given cycle... with the hope of winning the pool of experience lost by
   all gellirs. Many will choose to defer redeeming their boons as experience
   to avoid that experience being subject to death-losses. This will keep
   these players small until they decide to stop being active gellirs. They
   will need to weigh the trade-off of defering experience redemption against
   the decay of boon points due to the 5% tax they attract each Armageddon.

7. If large players want to reliably win the experience pool -- with no actual
   interest in searching out rare words and forming strong galdrar and
   having those galdrar heard early and on purpose -- they have some obstacles:

   a) Active gellirs will know where all the currently rarest adjectives
      are to be found and will be keeping them a secret in order to win
      the experience pool for themselves. It takes time and diligence
      to find and use these words -- especially since using them actually
      decreases their rarity. A large player will not likely be an
      active gellir.

   b) Active gellirs will try to have their best attempt at a powerful
      galdr heard as early as possible after Armageddon -- involving dying
      on purpose after binding that galdr. This is so that galdr accumulates
      a lot of TIME (see 4. above) as well as possessing much POWER.

   c) Large gellirs risk more experience when dying than do small gellirs.
      All deaths with bound galdrar, no matter the size of the gellir, warrant
      a hearing by Lars.

8. To prevent griefing of active gellirs by non-gellirs, there are these
   considerations :

   a) Active gellirs don't mind dying... since they are going to have to
      do so anyway. Any death they suffer with a bound galdr will contribute
      experience points to the pool, which they hope to win at the end of
      the current Arma cycle.

   b) Gellirs are not obvious to onlookers. Their club object is invisible,
      and their actions are indistinguishable from normal actions. To <muse> 
      appears like an ordinary <search>. To <form> a galdr appears as 
      writing a message. To <bind> a galdr gives no outward indication.
      Gellirs become obvious when they die and their bound galdr is heard
      by all present in the room of their death.

9. Given all of the above, a dynamic and shifting competition will exist to
    find and use and keep-secret rare kraftords. This will encourage closer
    attention being paid to rooms and room-items in the Realms; competitve 
    interplay between club members and cooperative interplay between club
    members and non-members in social groupings.
   

----KRAFTORDS:

1. Kraftords are adjectives collected among all the words from room and
   room-item descriptions in the Realms by <musing> with the invisible
   club-object (larsreykr).
   Musing has the same paralysis duration as a search. Larsgellirs can
   <examine> descriptions like anyone else.  If they see words they want,
   they can <muse> that room or room-item and collect all those words for
   later use.

2. The rarity of the rarest adjective (kraftord) used by a gellir among all
   the description elements determines the 'power' of their Larsgaldr. The
   gellir with the greatest POWER x TIME summed over all their galdrar 
   heard in the current Arma cycle, is awarded the pooled experience losses
   by all gellirs heard in that cycle, at the start of the next cycle.

3. Kraftord eligibility and rarity is determined from a read-only mapping of
   english language adjective frequency (covering 4300 words) -- modified
   by actual usage in hearings, changes being made each Armageddon.  If a
   rare kraftord is used in a galdr hearing, it becomes less rare by the
   amount of time between its hearing and Armageddon. This makes it
   proportionally less powerful after that Armageddon. The rarity of words
   increases when they are not used cycle on cycle -- so their 'power'
   slowly recovers to their english-language base frequency with time. 

----SETTING:

1. The club's in-realm rooms are accessed from a single outside room in
   the northern forest of Sparkle.

2. Apart from joining, leaving and redeeming boons, all other club functions
   do not require presence in the club rooms.

3. The club does not provide food, accommodation, notice board nor member lists.
