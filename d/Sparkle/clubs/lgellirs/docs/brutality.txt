The intent of staging delivery of the general experience win is to allow the
player's brutality to function normally. Currently the number of delivery stages
is 9, but this can easily be increased up to 36 with just a change in the defs.h
file. Delivery occurs in a period of about 36-40 seconds.

The delivery of general experience to the winning member occurs via calls to
 ... std/living/savevars.c/add_exp_general( exp )     (line 1106 of savevars.c)

This function uses brutality to reduce the actual experience gain (stat_exp)
  of the player down from the input experience (exp)
 ... query_brute_factor()                        (line 981 of savevars.c)
 ... update_acc_exp(stat_exp, guild_exp)         (line 1146 of savevars.c)

-----

The club code makes calls to add_exp_general at:

Code: daemon.c
Line 1715:  plyr->add_exp_general( (gxp % nstages) );

Code: room/larsether_base.c  
Line 91:  ob->add_exp_general(gxp_incr);

The first call delivers the integer remainder of (experience / nstages)
and the second delivers the per-stage experience increment.

------

So high-brutality players will actually get very little of the experience prize.
Apparently, < 10% of each increment once past 'violent'.

Low-brutality players will get significant amounts of the early increments, but
for large prizes they will not get much from the later increments, because their
brutality will have gone up in the normal way with each successive increment.
