------------------------------------

ASKELUND -
    ASKR (Old Norse) - ash tree... [sacred tree of Odin... Lars]
    LUND (Swedish) - grove
    The small surviving remnant of the ASKVEROLD, a small grove 
    of deathless evergrowing ash trees, beside the LITILLGAP. The trees are
    cut by the WOODSMAN and burned in the FIRE, tended by VOLVASKR in
    accordance with the COVENANT. No mortal blade or agency can cut or
    mark the ash trees of the grove. The Askelund is in high forest of
    northern Sparkle.

ASKVEROLD -
    ASKR (Old Norse) - ash tree... [sacred tree of Odin... Lars]
    VEROLD (anglicized Old Norse) - world
    The original Creation of Lars, the early world covered in an evergrowing
    deathless ash forest. The Askverold was split in two by the MIKILLGAP.
    The endless press of growth caused all trees and wild innocent creatures,
    pushed to the edge, to tumble into oblivion in the Mikillgap. Creation
    and growth, the province of Lars, was always separate from destruction
    and oblivion, the province of Death. This was changed by the coming of
    the FIRE and the concluding of the COVENANT.

BOONS of LARS -
    A gift of growth bestowed upon a GELLIR by LARS in the remaking of the
    world after Armageddon. LARS finds favour in gellirs according to the 
    power and duration of their of their LARSGALDRAR. DEATH makes no 
    objection to these boons of growth since they invariably lead to
    the FOLK who receive them being ever more powerful agents of
    destruction in the WORLD. If DEATH were to ever chuckle, he might
    do so over this fact.

COVENANT, the - the unbreakable binding agreement between LARS, DEATH and
    the FOLK. Under the COVENANT, the FOLK -- conscious of independent
    thought and action -- became agents of creation and destruction
    across the WORLD. Carrying the fire of this agency before them,
    they changed all the world and themselves beyond all recognition.
    This swept away the long dull ages of the ASKVEROLD and MIKILLGAP,
    where Creation and Destruction were held separate and apart in 
    their own Domains -- the provinces of Lars and Death respectively.
    By way of the Covenant, Lars and Death find the choices and actions
    of mortal folk somewhat amusing compared to what came before it.
    For example, the Folk have invented the concept of Good and Evil;
    which Lars and Death do not comprehend but enjoy the ructions it
    seems to cause -- endless opportunities for growth and decline.
    It is under the terms of the Covenant, that members of the Folk
    who die are restored to life again by Lars and Death (sometimes
    grudgingly) so that the amusement can continue.

DEATH - Lord of Destruction. Necessary and indispensable counter to LARS
        and Creation. In contrast to Lars, Death plays close attention to 
	all things in the world -- holding sway over mortal things in 
	accordance with the COVENANT. Prior to the COVENANT, there were
	the countless long ages of the ASKVEROLD and the MIKILLGAP. Death
	has many avatars; including the WOODSMAN in the ASKELUND.

DONUT, the - the World in the shape of a Great Torus. It is not clear if 
       it had this same shape in the Ages of the ASKVEROLD and MIKILLGAP.
       As ever, it is shrouded in the chill turbulence of the LARSETHER.

EXTREMIS - the name given by Larsgellris to the room between Death and
       returning to life -- familiar to all FOLK, whether gellirs or not.
       Extremis is the only known place where Larsgaldrar can be yelled
       so they reach the hearing of LARS.

FIRE, the - the first fire which was sparked in the ASKVEROLD by a lightning
      strike from above. Those innocent wild creatures who were gathered about
      it, tended it and became conscious of their thoughts and actions and
      became the FOLK. The WOODSMAN appeared to cut more wood for the Fire
      from the trees of the ASKVEROLD, and the TWO RAVENS flew down to warm
      themselves by the Fire and teach the Folk. The COVENANT was concluded
      between the Folk, and LARS (represented by the Two Ravens) and Death
      (represented by the Woodsman). The Folk then took fire with them 
      wherever they went across the WORLD and changed it forever. The TENDERS
      remained behind to tend the Fire in the ASKELUND. Inspiring the smoke
      of the Fire -- the LARSREYKR -- it is from these folk that the first
      LARSGELLIRS emerged. The Fire remains tended to this day. Its burning
      symbolises the COVENANT.

FOLK, the - All mortals possessing freedom of thought and action bound by
      the COVENANT with LARS and DEATH -- ie. player characters. The Folk
      were those innocent wild creatures which gathered about when the FIRE
      first came to the ASKVEROLD. They tended the FIRE, became conscious of
      thought and action, were visited by the TWO RAVENS and the WOODSMAN,
      were made party to the Covenant and made their way with fire to cover
      all the world and change it forever. From the original singular race
      of SPARKLINGS, the Folk have spread and changed into all Races in the
      world. Few among the Folk still know of the Covenant -- even though
      they are bound by it. Fewer still recognise the common origin of all
      Races.  Almost none refer to themselves as being of the Folk, with
      the exception of regular TENDERS of the Fire.

KRAFTORD, KRAFTORDS
     KRAFT (Swedish etc) - power, strength
     ORD (Swedish etc) - word
     A word of power is one which describes all the many parts of the Creation
     of LARS. They are mused upon by LARSGELLIRS and used by them to form and
     bind LARSGALDRAR. Kraftords of particular rarity and fineness have the 
     most power to gain the fickle attention of Lars when galdrar are carried
     into his hearing. The attention of Lars is captured momentarily by the
     celebration in chant of his Works in these words. He does, however,
     quickly lose interest in kraftords which are too often used to capture
     this attention.

LARS - Lord of Creation. Original creator of the WORLD. Now distant, distracted
       and absent-minded. It is notoriously difficult to get his attention.
       He is usually only seen by FOLK when he intercedes at the time 
       of their death in the face of DEATH in accordance with the COVENANT.
       Prior to the COVENANT, their were the countless long dull ages of the
       ASKVEROLD and the MIKILLGAP. Lars has many avatars; including the 
       TWO RAVENS in the ASKELUND.

LARSETHER
    ETHER - The substance filling the upper regions of the atmosphere above
            the clouds, in particular as a medium breathed by deities... 
	    ... [the chill turbulent medium which lies above mortal air of
	         the world, encircling the great Donut]
    The Larsether can sweep up and transport LARSGELLIRS from atop the
    LITILLGAP around the world, splashing down in a nearby watery remnant
    of the MIKILLGAP -- Sparkle harbour. When journeying through the Larsether,
    gellirs get a glimpse of all FOLK on the surface of the Donut in terms of
    their personal KRAFTORDS and those in their immediate surroundings. The 
    Larsether is a place of mortal replenishment and the granting of BOONS.

LARSGALDR, LARSGALDRAR
    GALDR, GALDRAR (English borrowed from Old Norse) - An ancient form of
    shamanic chanting, an improvisational magical song, especially for a
    protective effect... 
    Larsgaldrar are yelled in EXTREMIS after death by LARSGELLIRS. They are
    borne on the LARSREYKR into the hearing of LARS. Those galdrar which
    contain great KRAFTORDS gain favour with Lars. Those gellirs who
    gain the greatest favour are remembered by Lars as he remakes the WORLD
    after Armageddon and are granted BOONS. It is notoriously difficult 
    for mortals to gain the attention of Lars; it seems that he is never
    seen except for at the point of death, in accordance with the COVENANT.

LARSGELLIR, LARSGELLIRS
    GELLIR, GELLIRS (Icelandic) - yeller, one who yells...  [to LARS]
    Those of the FOLK who stayed to tend the FIRE -- the TENDERS -- were
    taught by the TWO RAVENS of LARS and Creation. Inspiring the LARSREYKR
    and hearing the words of the Two Ravens, the first LARSGELLIRS emerged.
    First among the Larsgellirs is VOLVASKR, an ancient SPARKLING, become
    immortal by way of her LARSGALDRAR down through the ages. VOLVASKR 
    welcomes and guides new gellirs from all FOLK across the world.

LARSREYKR
    REYKR (Old Norse) - smoke... 
    Smoke from the FIRE -- the burning of wood from the trees of the ASKELUND,
    left over from the original Creation of LARS. The Larsreykr and the Fire
    are associated with the COVENANT, by which the FOLK spread out across the
    WORLD as conscious agents of simultaneous creation and destruction. 
    LARSGELLIRS emerged when mortals inspired the Larsreykr. It is the Larsreykr
    which streams from their essence in EXTREMIS to bear their LARSGALDR to Lars.

LITILLGAP 
    LITILL (Old Norse) - small
    GAP (Old Norse) - empty space
    The small surviving remnant of the original abyss of Death, the MIKILLGAP.
    The vast majority of the Mikillgap filled with water and widened to become
    all the lakes and seas and oceans of the world. The Litillgap is a narrow
    fissure beside the ASKELUND in the high northern forests of Sparkle. Like
    the Mikillgap of old, the Litillgap is bottomless. LARSGELLIRS often use the
    top of the Litillgap as a leaping off place. Some are swept up by the
    LARSETHER while others fall to their death in the abyss to meet again with
    DEATH and LARS.

MIKILLGAP -
    MIKILL (Old Norse) - great
    GAP (Old Norse) - empty space
    The Great Abyss bisecting the original creation of Lars (ASKVEROLD).
    The Mikillgap was Death's counter to the evergrowing deathless forest. 
    The endless press of growth in the ASKVEROLD caused all trees and wild
    innocent creatures, pushed to the edge, to tumble into oblivion in the
    Mikillgap. Creation and growth, the province of Lars, was always separate
    from destruction and oblivion, the province of Death. This was changed
    by the coming of the FIRE and the concluding of the COVENANT. The vast
    majority of the Mikillgap filled with water and widened to become all
    the lakes and seas and oceans of the world. Only the narrow LITILLGAP
    retains the character of the original great abyss.

SPARKLING, a -
     A member of the original race of the FOLK present when the FIRE was
     sparked from above by a lightning strike. All other races emerged from
     the Sparklings over long ages. Few, if any, remain of this original form.
     Even VOLVASKR, who survives to this day tending the FIRE, has been much
     changed by her choices and actions. Perhaps some true Sparklings remain
     hidden in modern Sparkle, but this is unlikely.

TENDERS, the - those of the FOLK who still tend the FIRE, the original fire
     which burns in a clearing in the ASKELUND. Tending the Fire commemorates
     the COVENANT between LARS and DEATH and the FOLK. One of the very first
     Tenders, VOLVASKR, has seen all the Ages come and go. The WOODSMAN cuts
     the wood of the Askelund for the Tenders to feed the Fire. The TWO
     RAVENS tought the Tenders of Lars and Creation. Inspiring the LARSREYKR
     and hearing the words of the Two Ravens, the first LARSGELLIRS emerged.
     First among the Larsgellirs is VOLVASKR.

TWO RAVENS, the - heraldic avatars of LARS who frequent the ASKELUND. The
     Two Ravens came shortly to the ASKVEROLD after the FIRE was first lit
     by a lightning strike. They watched as the innocent wild creatures
     saw the Fire and tended it and became the FOLK. The Ravens were the 
     agents of LARS who concluded the COVENANT with the Folk and DEATH
     through his agent (the WOODSMAN). Later, they taught those of the
     Folk who stayed to tend the Fire -- the TENDERS -- the ways of
     Lars and Creation. Inspiring the LARSREYKR and hearing the words of
     the Two Ravens, the first LARSGELLIRS emerged from these folk.

VOLVASKR
    VOLVA (English derivation from Old Norse) Female practitioner of magic
    divination and prophecy.
    ASKR (Old Norse) - ash tree... [sacred tree of Odin... Lars]
    Volvaskr is the oldest known surviving TENDER of the FIRE. She was one
    of the SPARKLINGS present when the Fire was first lit in the ASKVEROLD
    by a bolt of lightning from above. She was present when the COVENANT was
    formed. She was the first to heed the TWO RAVENS in the ways of LARS,
    inspire the LARSREYKR, and become a LARSGELLIR. She has grown so much
    over the ages that she is no longer mortal. She has devoted herself to
    welcoming and guiding other mortals who wish to become gellirs and
    have their LARSGALDRAR carry into the hearing of Lars. Through tending
    the Fire and becoming immortal through countless boons of growth, Volvaskr
    has changed much from the original sparkling form. She has taken on aspects
    of the Fire itself and the trees of the ASKELUND which surround her and it.

WOODSMAN, the - the functional avatar of DEATH in the ASKELUND. The Woodsman
   came shortly to the ASKVEROLD after the FIRE was first lit by a lightning
   strike. He watched as the innocent wild creatures saw the Fire and tended
   it, becoming the FOLK. He wielded his axe and cut the otherwise deathless
   ash trees of LARS, so that wood could be given to the Folk to tend the
   Fire. No mortal blade or agency can otherwise mark or cut these trees;
   not then nor now. The Woodsman was the agent of Death who concluded the
   COVENANT with the Folk and LARS (through his agents, the TWO RAVENS). It
   was the Woodsman who afterwards cut the trails from the Fire's clearing
   outwards, so that the Folk could make their way in the WORLD, carrying
   fire before them. To this day, the Woodsman provides the wood for the Fire
   in the Askelund -- from which the LARSREYKR rises and provides inspiration
   for LARSGELLIRS.

WORLD, the - surface and air above in which all creatures crawl, swim, run,
   fly and so on. Those of the FOLK and other more simple creatures inhabit
   this place. The World is known by the wise to possess the shape of
   the DONUT.
