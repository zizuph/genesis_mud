The Fire and the Folk -- Introductory Quest for the Gellirs of Lars
===================================================================

In this quest you must find the ancient ash grove in the north of Sparkle
where the original fire still burns and tend the fire. All that is required
is to explore a little bit and to follow the direction of the NPC present
by the fire.  The intent of this quest is to introduce players to the (club),
the Gellirs of Lars. The action <tend the fire> reveals exposition for an
origin story and directions on how to join the club. The NPC also provides
supplementary information to fire-tenders. Joining and leaving the club
occurs in the destination location of the quest. All races and alignments
are free to join the club without restriction.

Reward: 100 XP + awareness of the Gellirs of Lars
