 ||                                                                 ||

 ||     This is the thing that troubles me, for I cannot forget     ||
 ||     Carcosa where black stars hang in the heavens; where the    ||
 ||     shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon, when   ||
 ||     the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will  ||
 ||     bear for ever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray gods    ||
 ||     will curse the writer, as the writer has cursed the world   ||
 ||     with its beautiful stupendous creation, terrible in its     ||
 ||     simplicity, irresistible in its truth--a world which now    ||
 ||     trembles before the Great Old One 'Hastur', aka the King In ||
 ||     Yellow.                                                     ||
 ||                                                                 ||
 ||     I saw the lake of Hali, thin and blank, without a ripple    ||
 ||     or wind to stir it, and I saw the towers of Carcosa behind  ||
 ||     the moon. Aldebaran, the Hyades, Alar...glided              ||
 ||     through the cloud-rifts which fluttered and flapped as they ||
 ||     passed like the scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow.    ||
 ||                                                                 ||
 ||     I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the       ||
 ||     heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in    ||
 ||     the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the lake of     ||
 ||     Hali; and my mind will bear for ever the memory of the      ||
 ||     Pallid Mask.                                                ||
 ||                                                                 ||
 ||     I was immediately under the threlldom of the Yellow Sign,   ||
 ||     enlightened by the wisdom of He who should not be named, for||
 ||     there was no truer purpose, no truer form!                  ||
 ||                                                                 ||
