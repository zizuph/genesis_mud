In reviewing the skill limitations of both the rogue classes,
(rangers and thieves) it has become patently clear that they are
considerably disadvantaged due to the practical requirement of
needing alien skill types to be functional, resulting in
thematic skill sacrifices which are ultimately undesirable from
guild uniqueness and diversity point of view.
It is proposed the way skills are capped and taxed for guild
styles is changed slightly as described below.

INTRODUCING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SKILL TYPES
The type of skills a guild can train without penalty as an alien
skill are referred to here as as 'primary' skills, and is
determined by guild class.

For the guilds on the polar end of the skill spectrum (fighter,
mage, cleric) skills alien to the guild style should be offered
only in a very limited way. Skills alien to the guild style count
twice towards the sum of levels which the guild may offer *above*
the limits in 'man skills' (you do not apply this penalty to the
taxation of the skills which are alien).

Note that while SS_BACKSTAB is a mudlib skill for the purposes
of taxation it is consider in the same way as a 'special skill',
with its combat aid taxed as outlined in the standardised backstab
special /d/Genesis/specials/std/backstab.c. While skill points do
not count towards a guild's skill maximum, layman guilds should
not offer more than 60 levels in this skill.

Also note that awareness will now be a thief/ranger specific skill,
no longer a general skill meaning fighter/mage/cleric classes will
need to factor this in as an alien skill to their skill cap.

Occupational:
The maximum amount of skills such a guild can offer is 550 taxable
slots. In other words, only skill levels which exceed the maximum
listed in 'man skills' are counted towards this maximum. All
non-taxable skills fall under the restrictions of the adventurer
guild maximum.

The maximum teaching level in mudlib defined skills is 90. Higher
levels can only be taught after a difficult quest has been completed.
Occupational Rogue classes (thief/ranger) have a bit more
flexibility in accessing alien skills due to the utility importance
of combat and magic skills in Genesis. They can train 'secondary'
skills up to a maximum without a penalty counting towards their
total skill points:

Secondary Skill                 Style      Unpenalised skill max
================================================================
SS_WEP_SWORD           (0)      Ranger             75
SS_2H_COMBAT          (20)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_BLIND_COMBAT       (22)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_PARRY              (23)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_DEFENCE            (24)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_SPELLCRAFT         (30)      Ranger             75
SS_ELEMENT_*          (xx)      Ranger             75
SS_FORM_*             (xx)      Ranger             75
SS_HERBALISM          (36)      Ranger/Thief       70
SS_ALCHEMY            (37)      Ranger/Thief       70

In the past, the ranger class would have access to all skill types
up to 75, and then a 4x skill penalty for all skill levels over
75. That is no longer the case. While they have few primary skill
types, they have access to a large range of secondary skills,
and only suffer the standard 2x alien skill penalty.

For rogue class skills (those that are a 'thief/ranger' or 'thief
only' primary skill) only half of the skill levels count towards
an occupational thief/ranger guild skill cap (so for 80 points of
pick pockets, only 40 would count towards the 550 cap).

Further, to support the 'jack of all trade' philosophy of the
ranger class only half of the points from 'general' skills count
towards a ranger's skill maximum cap.
