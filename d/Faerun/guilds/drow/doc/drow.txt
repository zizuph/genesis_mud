The Drow of the Underdark
-------------------------
The Drow of the Underdark is a racial elf guild. It is neutral aligned so
all elves may join it.

The drow are historically chaotic evil and follow the Spider Queen, Lolth. She
demands the drow follow her absolutely. Most of them do, but there are some who
have broken free from her and follow their own hearts, and some are even good
aligned. These renegade drow follow other deities.

The drow are a matriarchal society where males are considered inferior and
female elves rule absolutely. The guild is set up this way. The guild is broken
down into houses which are ruled by female player.

When elves join the guild, they choose what house they are from, what deity
they will worship, and if a female, which house to rule over if there are
available houses.

After joining, the drow must apply to join a house. The leaders of the houses,
Matrons, can decide to accept or reject applicants. The Matrons rule their
houses as they see fit and have the final say in what happens there.

Matrons may elevate or demote drow in their house to different ranks. They
are:

    * First Daughter
    * House Patron
    * Weapons Master
    * Noble Daughters
    * Noble Sons
    * Commoners

When elves leave the guild, there is a waiting time of about 30 days before
they can rejoin. There is no other penalty since this is a racial guild other
than the special items they purchased no longer work or they have access to
them when they quit.
