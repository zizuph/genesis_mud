GUIDELINES & GAMEDESIGN for the FAERUN DOMAIN
==================================================================
 - By Nerull, 1/8-2910.
 
 
A guiding principe in good gamedesign entails gamecontent that 
is fair and functional for all players, so one should strive
to ensure gamecontent is playable, and available for all.
Naturally, deviations may occur due to thematic reasons, but 
one should still strive to ensure counters are created to ensure 
balance parity(if possible). 

This document will go through the most common and regular 
game content that is usually created by wizards, and proper guidelines
to ensure nobody create items, or challenges entirely blindfolded.



WEAPONS & WEAPONRY
==================
All weapons created in Faerun shall follow the described rules as
written. Please 'man weapon' to update yourself on the current rules
for game weaponry.

Magical weapons should be added in:
/d/Faerun/info/magic/weapons.txt



ARMOUR & CLOTHING
=================
All weapons created in Faerun shall follow the described rules as
written. Please 'man armour' to update yourself on the current rules
for game armors & clothing.

Magical armours should be added in:

MISC ITEMS

/d/Faerun/info/magic/items.txt



NPC & MONSTERS
==============
The general guideline for monsters and npcs in general that 
reward xp upon killed should follow the current CHALLENGE RATING
table as desbribed below. Deviations may occur, but one must
ensure that the npc that rewards x xp must also be y challenging.

    DEFINITIONS

    - CR        = Challenge rating

    - Size Avg  = Minimum average size, with up to 20% variance of
                  stat distribution
                
    - Min H/P   = Monster/ npc must have weapons (armed or
                  unarmed, depending on thematic nature)
                  the mininum hit and pen at this value.
                 
    - Min AC    = Monster / npc must have atleast this amount
                  of AC on every hit location. May be through the
                  use or armor, or natural / supernatural means.
                 
    - CB.Skills = Minimum relevant combatrelated skills.
    
    - Coin      = Max value of coins/gems dropped, or moneyitems 
                  dropped by monsters that are sellable.

              Challenge rating table
  --|----------|---------|--------|-----------|------
  CR| Size Avg | Min H/P | Min AC | CB.skills | Coin
  --|----------|---------|--------|-----------|------
  1 |  10-50   |  5-25   | 15     | 10-30     | xx
  2 |  51-80   | 20-40   | 25     | 30-50     | xx
  3 |  81-120  | 30+     | 30     | 50-80     | xx
  4 | 120-150  | 35+     | 35+    | 90+       | xx
  5 |*151-200  | 35+     | 35+    | 95+       | xx
  6 |*200+     | 35+     | 35+    | 95+       | xx
  
  * Npcs and monsters at CR rating 5 and above should have a 
    special attack, using the following formula:
    
    
    SPECIAL ATTACK EXAMPLE:   
    /*
     * Function name: special_attack()
     * Description  : Randomly triggers the special attack
     * Arguments    : Enemy = the enemy of the object
     */
    int
    special_attack(object enemy)
    {
        object *ob;
        object *enemies;
        object kill_enemy, enemy;
        int i;
        int did_push;
        int pen;
        object me;
        mixed* hitresult;
        string how;
        me = this_object();
        
        enemies = query_my_enemies();
        
        if (sizeof(enemies) == 0) return 0;
        
        /* This decides if we shall do anything more... */
        if (!random(3))
            return 0;
    
        enemy = me->query_attack();
        
        /*We want this to be hard. So they randomly switch targets*/
        if (!random(5))
        {   
             enemy = enemies[random(sizeof(enemies))];
             kill_enemy = enemy;
             command("kill "+kill_enemy->query_real_name());
        }
        
        pen = query_pen_by_stat(this_object()->query_average_stat());
        
        hitresult = enemy->hit_me(query_pen_by_stat(this_object()->query_average_stat()) 
        + random(600));
        
        switch (hitresult[3])
        {
            case 0..20:
                how = "without effect";
                break;
            case 21..50:
                how = "softly";
                break;
            case 51..80:
                how = "hard";
                break;
            case 81..110:
                how = "very hard";
                break;
            case 111..140:
                how = "extremely hard";
                break;
            case 141..170:
                how = "smashingly";
                break;
            default:
                how = "smashingly";
                break;
        }
        
        me -> catch_msg("You strike your opponent in the stomach, "+how+"!\n");
        
        enemy->catch_msg(QCTNAME(me)+" strikes you "+how+" in your stomach!\n");
        
        MIR_DEBUG("Pen " +pen+ ", hitresult: "+hitresult[3]+ ".");
        
        tell_watcher(QCTNAME(me)+" strikes "+QTNAME(enemy)+" "+how+
            " in the stomach!\n",enemy);
            
        if (enemy->query_hp() <= 0)
        {
            enemy->do_die(me);
            return 1;
        }
        
    }/*special_attack*/
    
    
    
 
  
AREAS, CITIES, DUNGEONS & GRINDERS
==================================
The gamemap is perhaps the most fudamentai game 
element necessary to design/complete at the 
earlier stage of a project. It is important that
the area coded thematically fits along with its
gamecontent such as items, puzzles, monsters and
npcs. Each area is designated with the range of
npc/monsters with a CR range.


   TOWN / CITIES
   --------------
   Usually major population areas with the majority
   of the inhabitants being peasants, traders, guards
   bandits, thieves. Usually supports the player with
   quest givers, shops and services.
   
   Suggested CR ratings:   1-4.
   
   
   
   WILDERNESS
   ----------
   Roads, swamps, mountain ranges, forests. Usually 
   larger outdoor areas and fields that are more
   challenging and dangerous than population centers.
   
   Suggested CR ratings:   2-5.
   
   
   DUNGEONS & GRINDERS
   -------------------
   Dungeons & Grinders are isolated limited areas of
   greater danger, but also greater rewards. They serve
   as typical quest objective locations, magical item
   dispensers and primary xp / loot areas. 
   
   Suggested CR ratings:   2-6+
   
   -When designing a grinder, it is important to keep
    size or number of factors rewarding xp/loot to
    a sober level. The XP / LOOT footprint is 
    measured in (x maximum number of monsters) x 
    average xp value, and similar with loot / coins
    generated by cleaning the dungeon.
    
    A typical good range of a grinder / dungeon in 
    terms of size / rooms are the 30-60 rooms.
    
    
    
LOOT & XP FOOTPRINTS
====================
Areas with x npcs / monsters add a total "footprint"
for xp and loot. This means the total worth of xp
from all combined monsters in x area, and same for
loot.

After cleaning an area, it is possible to maximally earn
x amount of xp, and y amount of platinum.

This should be calculated and mapped, prefereably in 
advance before building the area / dungeon if the 
area is intended as grinders. Too much of each
in a single area is not good and will probably not
be tolerated by the AoD / AoB.
