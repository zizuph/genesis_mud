Faerun is the primary setting of the Forgotten Realms. It is home to a number of non-human creatures of varying degrees of civilization or barbarism. Among these are several different races of dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and  elves. There are also goblins, orcs, lizardmen, ogres, various giants, and even dragons. 

The land Faerun is varied, containing everything from forests to grasslands to deserts, and even ice lands. Great cities dot the land such as Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Calimport, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and more.

Then there is Underdark, the realm of the Drow.

The common factor in Faerun is magic, which permeates everything.

The timeline we are using is around 1484, also known as the Year of the Awakened Sleepers.
