Faerun is based on the theme provided in the many fantasy books written 
for the Forgotten Realms series.

Faerun is easiest described as a large mainland of Abeir-Toril. The 
different regions of Faerun ranges from ice cold mountain ranges of 
Icewind Dale, coastal regions like the Sword coast, lush forest areas,
dale lands, deserts and moors. Many rivers flows across the continent 
and large tradeways forms a net to support the important trade between
the different regions. Underneath the surface lurk the drows...among
others.
