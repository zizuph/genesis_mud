BITS - Listing of bits used
---------------------------
This file should contain a table with three columns: 
    
    * The group number
    * The bit numbers
    * The experience (if it is a quest) 
    * A very brief description of what the bit is used for.

If quests are binary coded, please explain the levels in the binary coding. Since this doc is for bit-listing, do _not_ add long quest descriptions here. Those should be in the QUESTS directory.  The ideal BITS file should have _one_ line per bit.
