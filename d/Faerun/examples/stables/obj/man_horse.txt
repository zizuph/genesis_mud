Bree Steed Help File

Last Updated Feb 9, 2003

Thank you for renting a Bree steed. Our steeds are high quality Rohan-bred
animals. With proper understanding of how to use and take care of your steed
we know you will have a most pleasurable riding experience.

Note: I use the word 'steed' in this document, which you can use instead of
'horse' or 'pony' in any of the commands.

Your new steed understands several commands and and can do several emotes,
controlled by you.

Your steed will have a different set of commands and emotes, depending on
whether you are leading or riding the steed.


Riding and Leading Your Steed
-----------------------------
To mount your steed, simply use:

mount <steed>

To get off your horse:

dismount
or
dismount <steed>

<steed> Can be 'horse' or 'pony', depending on which you rented.

To lead your steed use the same format:

lead <steed>

To stop leading your horse:
unlead <steed>

If you are leading your horse you may also:
mount <steed>

This makes you unlead, then mount your steed.

In general you will want to stay mounted, as opposed to leading your steed,
in most situations. Your steed is not very fond of water, so you must be
mounted to cross rivers.


Boarding Ships
--------------
When you board a ship you must be mounted, not leading. Our steeds don't
particularly enjoy water so they won't be led onto a ship.

Your steed does not ride for free (Except the Circle Line). To make boarding
and purchasing tickets easier, you have the 'hboard' command. This simply buys
two tickets and boards the ship.

Disembarking a ship with your steed works the same as if you had no steed.
Simply 'disembark' or 'leave ship'.


Feeding and Watering Your Steed
_______________________________
A happy steed is a well-fed and watered steed. Your steed is a hearty eater
and enjoys hay, oats, apples and of course sugar cubes. To feed your
steed, simply:

feed horse/pony with <food>

Example:
feed pony with apple

To make your steed drink, simply:

hdrink from <water source>

Basically any room that has a water source that you can drink from,
your steed can too. So if you can 'drink from river' yourself, you can
make your steed drink too with 'hdrink from river'.

Try it in the Bree Stables. The east yard has a water trough.


Using the Bree Saddlebags
_________________________
Your new steed isn't just your best friend. Its also a fantastic pack
animal. With the saddlebags in the Bree Tack Shop you can carry quite
a load on your steed. The saddlebag doubles as a regular pack also.

After purchasing a saddlebag you'll want to put it on your steed:
strap saddlebag on steed

To fill your saddlebag with whatever is in your inventory:
fill saddlebag on steed

To empty the contents of the saddlebag:
empty saddlebag on steed

To close your saddlebag on the steed:
close saddlebag on steed

To open your saddlebag on the steed:
open saddlebag on steed

To take the saddlebag off your steed:
unstrap saddlebag on steed

To view the contents of your saddlebag:
hpack

Note: Only the person riding can see the contents.


Automount / Autodismount
-------------------------
Some indoor rooms allow steeds inside, but you have to be leading, not mounted.
In this case, if you have typed 'autodismount', you will dismount your steed
and lead it into the room.

If you have 'automount' set you will automatically mount your steed when you
lead it back outside.

Some indoor rooms do not allow steeds at all and autodismount will not help
you. You will have to manually dismount or unlead your horse.


Galloping or Trotting
---------------------
You can make your horse gallop or trot.

To make your horse gallop:
hgallop on

To make your horse trot:
hgallop off


Horse Behavior
______________
You can set your horses agressiveness towards others
with the 'hnice' command:

To make your horse friendly:
hnice on

To make your horse bite people when touched:
hnice off

Bree Stables can not and will not be held responsible if your steed bites
someone. Use at your own risk.


Emotes
------

List of emotes:

hsnort
hscrape <adverb>
hnuzzle <player>
