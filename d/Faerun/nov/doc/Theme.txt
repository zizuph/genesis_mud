              NECROMANCERS OF VILE DARKNESS
              =============================

"I shall laugh as I place my head on the block, laugh at 
them all as the raven jeers at the gallows or the worm mocks 
the grave. It took the Prince's most powerful knights to 
bring me - shackled in cold iron - before my earthly liege,
but not before I had slain a hundred of his retainers, twisted
the insides of his beloved wife, cursed their only son with 
ravening madness eternal. 

I have lain among the rat-gnawed bones of the oubliette 
and accepted the iron maiden's cruel embrace, but 1 am 
not alone, and I feel no pain. The slaadi still comfort me
with their infernal melodies, and my invisible familiars 
still inform me, bringing news in the clammy darkness from
my lord Thasmudyan. I shall have eternal life for my 
devoted service; the baatezu lord has promised me this final 
boon. 
  
I will survive, of that I am certain, but my next evolution
may not remember all of my secrets, all the cryptic mysteries
of the Art. I shall bid the shadows to write them down, inscribe
them in a book so that I may remember all that I knew before 
I died: And then I shall depart this earthly realm and walk on
farther shores, undreaming and unbidden, until I stand once 
again in the ivory court of Thasmudyan."


                       INTRODUCTION
                       ============ 
                    
"Over thirtyfour year has passed since the Lich Thasmudyan 
vanished from our floating temple in the negative material 
plane. His fate is uknown but it is believed that he found 
a way to achieve the status of demilich.

Thasmudyan left the temple in order, most of his tomes where 
left in place in the libraries, but his phylactery was nowhere 
to be found. I was left alone to manage the few students to 
continue the research of over life and death and to manage the 
order, as the vile darkness of Necromancy had to be further 
tapped into, as we might discover what Thasmudyan once learned 
about the rituals to lichdom." 
   
                             
                          THEME
                          =====
   
To early man, the spectre of death was an ever-looming shadow 
on the horizon, be it from war, starvation, disease or from 
the elements, death was man's greatest mystery, and thus his
greatest fear. 
           
These are the mortals who have turned to the dark arts to seek 
escape from death or power over death by tapping into the raw
negative forces to do their bidding through heavy researching 
of the tomes of Thasmudyan the lich, but in so doing, they 
risk to be shunned and hated by all of normal society if their 
nature is discovered, because they study the most feared and 
maligned school of magic, an ancient form of death worship that 
pre-dates recorded history by thousands of years....Necromancy -- the 
mere word strikes terror, disgust, and a dark curiosity in the 
hearts of mortals. Yet, there are those who fear not the Magic 
of Death but accept its embrace willingly, for it is their chosen
path, they are the Necromancers, speakers to the dead, conjurers
of Entropy, and disdained by those of the mainland.


The Necromancers have a temple in the nether that is floating in the
cold space of negative energy. Within, protected from the 
lifedraining forces on the outside, members of the Necromancer
order works combined to research the mysteries of Thasmudyan's
tomes which is located in the libraries. What is important is
the research, each member have to research their own spells by
spending time reading hundreds of books in the different libraries.

In addition, they can craft magical runes depending on how skilled
they are in runecrafting. A rune can be imbued into a weapon or 
armour by a smith (player smith, in the smith's forge) to create weapon
or armour with an magical effect. This means, 2 layman guilds can create 1 
limited magical weapon or armour, thus giving the guild something 
extra to do than just killing monsters.

To get to the temple, you must teleport, and to get from the temple
you have to use one of the portals that pops up in their portal
chamber.

The order has a council organ labeled High Maguses. High Maguses can
accept new students right away, punish members etc, as its main function
is to make sure the rules are followed. Players who are not invited can
join by themselves through a week long quest.
