                      The Past
                      --------
Lord Soth was a true and noble knight of Solamnia. But he was an 
intensely passionate man, lacking in self-discipline, and this 
was his downfall. 
Soth fell in love with a beautiful elf maid, a disciple of the 
King priest of Istar. He was married at the time, but thoughts of 
his wife vanished at the sight of the elf maid’s beauty. Forsaking 
both his sacred marriage vows and his knightly vows, Soth gave to 
his passion. Lying to the girl, he seduced her and brought her 
to live at Dargaard Keep, promising to marry her. His wife 
disappeared under sinister circumstances. 

The elf maid remained true to the knight, even after she 
discovered his terrible misdeeds. She prayed to the Goddess 
Mishakal that the knight be allowed to redeem himself and, 
apparently, her prayers were answered. Lord Soth was given the 
power to prevent the Cataclysm, though it would mean sacrificing 
his own life. 

Strengthened by the love of the girl he had wronged, Lord Soth 
left for Istar, fully intending to stop the King priest and 
restore his shattered honour. 

But the knight was halted in his journey by elven women, disciples 
of the King priest, who knew of Lord Soth's crime and threatened 
to ruin him. To weaken the effects of the elf maid’s love, they 
intimated that she had been unfaithful to him in his absence. 

Soth's passions took hold of him destroying his reason. In a 
jealous rage he rode back to Dargaard Keep. Entering his door, 
he accused the innocent girl of betraying him. Then the Cataclysm 
struck. The great chandelier in the entryway fell to the floor, 
consuming the elf maid and her child in flames. As she died, she 
called down a curse upon the knight, condemning him to eternal, 
dreadful life. Soth and his followers perished in the fire, only 
to be reborn in a hideous form. 

                    The Present
                    -----------
Once, the Gods punished the world of Krynn with the Cataclysm and
the sinking of the eminent city of Istar. It fell under the flaming 
mountain of lava and blazing coal after which bards made to legend 
and stories. Hundreds of years later, in the loneliness of his own 
neglected domain, a mysterious being sat alone. His unseen face, so 
hideous his own mother would reject him, remained covered by his 
thick armour. Still, out living his mother by at least a hundred
years, he thought nothing of his past. Only the repugnant memories 
of his sins lived with him. Since his face was ravaged and beaten 
by his own misjudgement which caused him to live past the days of 
the cataclysm, he elected to conceal his form within a helm. The 
helm was also charred and blackened by the flames which caused his 
family's death, but still nothing worse than what lies within the 
armour. 

The blood moon, the malicious moon which the dark wizards 
paid homage to, casted its attention to the godforsaken Dargaard 
Keep, the home of Lord Soth. The monotonous beams of the blood moon 
reflected, colourlessly, from Lord Soth's obsidian like armour. The 
faded symbol of the Knights of the Rose became visible, but still 
buried within the soot. Words of his late elven wife still plagued 
his mind. His beaming red eyes stare through the picture that hung 
above him, a picture of the Soth of old. This was before the 
Cataclysm, when he prided himself as a noble knight of good, a 
Knight of Solamnia. Many things have altered Lord Soth's life 
since. He has gained a rabid hatred for the Solamnic Knights, and 
any other symbol of good for that matter. Studying the picture 
again, he thought of his elven wife, the woman that caused his 
suffering. He remembered the words she cursed him with as he refused 
to save their only so from the inferno of the Cataclysm. He often 
whispered the words to fill the emptiness of the keep. "You will die 
this night in fire, even as your son and I die." The lonely man 
whispered through his blackened helm. His words echoed through the
hollow Dargaard Keep, with no one to answer to them. "Nevertheless, 
you will live from every life your folly has brought to an end." 

Many people, including the wise, true Clerics of Mishakal, believed 
that the King priest, an entity in his own mind, was responsible for 
angering the Gods, thus causing the cataclysm. Then, some believed 
it was all in the hands of Lord Soth, now renamed the lord of the 
undead or the lord of evil.

Even now, as Soth sits in his study, nobody truly knows who caused
the Cataclysm, but just like every fault, there must be someone to
blame.
