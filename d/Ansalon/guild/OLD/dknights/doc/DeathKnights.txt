Hello.
Here it is. A new guild in the Krynn domain, I've talked to Boron and Milan
about it, and they basicly only need your permission for me to continue my
work with the guild. Some of the abilities that the knights can have might
seem to hard to balance, but let me know because I'm always open for
suggestions.

Cheers
Elmore.

DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.
-----------------------

Type: Fighter / Magic
Slots: Occ and Layman guild

     Crown  - 33 %
     Sword  - 34 %
     Rose   - 36 %

History
-------
(The history of the Death Knights of Krynn is placed in
 the file /d/Ansalon/guild/dknights/doc/history.txt)

                     Death Knights
                     -------------
If a player wishes to become a death knight, they must first
solve the entrance quest for the guild. But before that, they
must first be allowed to solve it. This is done by a vote in
the council and by using the following number of votes:

   Head of Council   - 2 Votes.
   Council member    - 1 Vote.
   Council member    - 1 Vote.
   Council member    - 1 Vote.

This also means that if one of the council members or the head
of the council is inactive, the remaining council can still
vote new members in.
If the player gets three or more votes in his favour, he will
be allowed to solve the entrance quest. The quest can be started
by one of the council members. (See the EntranceQuest.txt file
in the /d/Ansalon/guild/dknights/doc dir).
The new member will enter the role of one of the loyal knights
that Lord Soth commanded when he was a solamnian knight. Even
loyal in death, the knights within the keep was cursed as well
when the Keep burned and therefore they are cursed to an
eternal life as an undead.


Rules of the Death Knights
--------------------------
All death knights were once proud and able warriors, and their 
statistics reflect this. Even the most inexperienced death 
knight must have had some ability before it died, or it would 
not have been made a death knight in the first place. As a 
result, death knights always have some rules that must be 
followed, these are listed below.

- All death knights are evil in alignment. (Alignment < -500,
  if a death knight goes above this alignment, they will be 
  banished from the guild).
- A death knight must still uphold his code of honour. 
  Therefore a death knight may never attack an unarmed enemy, 
  cowardly flee from battle or anything else that should 
  question their honour.
  (I would like to leave this up the each player, their character
   might still uphold their honour while others might prefer
   to ignore it).
- They hate all that reminds them of their previous glory as
  true solamian knights. 
  (I would like to leave this up the each player, their character
   might still accept them while others might not).
- No tattoos. The death knights are undead, they barely have 
  any skin left on their decaying bodies. Therefore the 
  members may not have any tattoos at all.
- Correct eyes/hair/skin. The council must make sure that the
  members stay 'in character' this means that a member may 
  not get crystal blue eyes, green skin etc. They must 
  follow the 'real' ideal for a true death knight.
(See rules.txt for more information)

Abilities
---------
Here are the abilities that the death knights have. Each of 
these abilities depend on their level within the guild and 
their skills.

  * Each death knight gains a magic resistance equal to their
    occ guildstat / 2. To a maximum of 75%.
  * No death knight can eat or drink nor use any item that
    must be ingested, since it has no natural bodily functions
    and cannot eat, drink, or breathe, even if it desired.
    This also means that a death knight can not become exhausted
    like a normal mortal.


Special
-------
The death knights have two special attacks. They can only
perform one of these at a time, so I will only tax the one
with the highest tax.


Name: Reap
Requirements: 3 mana.
Desc: This special will reap the lifeforce of a living being, 
      and therefore it will not work on any object that has the 
      prop LIVE_I_UNDEAD. The special will add 50% of the 
      damage to the death knight as hp.
Special time: approx once every 5 combat rounds.
Chance to hit: cb_tohit value is 95 (84% chance to hit).
Combat aid: 
Tax:
     hitres = target->hit_me(F_PENMOD(
             (attacker->query_stat(SS_WIS) +
              attacker->query_stat(SS_INT)) /4,
              attacker->query_skill(SS_GUILD_SPECIAL_REAP)),
              MAGIC_DT, attacker, -1);

     Considering skills and stats of 100 the max pen will be
     336. The following formula is used to calculate combat aid. 
        
     combat aid: (20% * 336/280) * 84% = 20.16% combat aid.

     I'll add 50% tax because it heals the death knight 50% of the damage given.
     Total reap tax = 20.16 / 6 = 3,36 * 1,5 = 5,04 %
                                               =======
      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Assault
Requirements: 3 mana.
Desc: This special uses one or both of the weapons that the death
      knight is wielding, to stab or crush the enemy. The special
      can not be used if the death knight isn't wielding a weapon.
Special time: approx once every 2,5 combat rounds.
Combat aid: 80.4%
Tax:
    hitres = target->hit_me(F_PENMOD(
            (attacker->query_stat(SS_DEX) * 1,5 +
             attacker->query_stat(SS_STR) + (weapon_damage * 2)) /2,
             attacker->query_skill(SS_GUILD_SPECIAL_DASSAULT)),
             weapon->query_dt(), attacker, -1);

     Considering skills, stats of 100 and a weapon with 35/35 the max pen will be
     670. The following formula is used to calculate combat aid. 
        
     combat aid: (40% * 670/280) * 84% = 80.4% combat aid.

     Total reap tax = 80.4 / 6 = 13.4 %
                                =======


Titles
------
The death knight title system, doesn’t just require enough 
guild stat. It uses the same system that the Solamnian Knights
have. Everyone starts out as a squire, after some time, the
squire will be allowed to enter the Crown Order, later on
they will be allowed into the Sword Order and lastly they
will become a member of the Rose Order.
The titles that the death knight can get:

Squire:
    Dark Squire of Dargaard Keep
    Ashen Squire of Dargaard Keep
    Blackened Squire of Dargaard Keep

Crown Knight:
    Knight of the Iron Crown
    Death Warrior of Dargaard Keep
    Lord Death Warrior of Dargaard Keep
    Lord of the Iron Crown

Sword Knight:
    Knight of the Burning Sword
    Ashen Clerist of Dargaard Keep
    Black Clerist of Dargaard Keep
    Lord of the Burning Sword

Rose Knight:
    Knight of the Black Rose
    Death Knight of Pain
    Death Knight of Dargaard Keep
    Lord Death Knight of Dargaard Keep
    Lord of the Black Rose


Spells
------
Every death knight will have the option of gaining spells, 
these spells will depend on the level of the death knight. 
The successrate will increase depending on the level of the
Death Knight.

Squire       : Cause Fear
               Detect Magic

Crown Order  : Symbol of Pain
               Symbol of Fear

Sword Knight : Fireball
               Wall of Ice

Rose Order   : Power Word Stun
               Power Word Kill
               Power Word Blind
  
If the target has enough magic resistance, the spells will 
reduced their damage or fail.
(See the tax doc for each spell in the dir
 /d/Ansalon/guild/dknights/doc/spells/)
                     
Skills
------
Using the basic skills from the Knights of Solamnia, I have 
constructed the list below that the death knight can get.
Once the death knight enters the Crown Order he or she will
have the chance to select club instead of sword skill.

Leaving The Death Knights
-------------------------
If a player wants to leave the death knights, he or she must
seek out the desecrated altar of Paladin in Dargaard Keep.
The player can here 'pray for forgiveness' and Paladine will
grant the player his wish of mortal life and therefore 
killing the player and thowing him out of the guild.
