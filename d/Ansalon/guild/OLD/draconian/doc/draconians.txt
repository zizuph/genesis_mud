Draconians of Krynn
-----
Type: Race (possibly layman as well)
Location: Neraka, Ansalon
Alignment: Neutral

Background
----
The Priests of Takhisis created a process to corrupt good metallic dragon eggs into draconians
underneath their temple in Neraka. Using this theme, the players are able to become transformed
into draconians by selecting one of the different types below here (except Baaz). The guild
fits well into the current time and theme of Krynn, and would improve the roleplay of the
guilds in Krynn/Ansalon. The guild is not meant to be immense powerful, but instead each 
draconian type will have a single spell that could give an advantage in battle or might be 
helpful in another way.

The draconians consists of 5 different types.
Baaz.  Smaller draconians (foot soldiers), doesn't have any special skills or abilities. 
       Turns to stone when killed.
Kapak. Assassin draconians, can either coat their weapons with poisoned saliva or use the
       saliva to heal themselves. Some sources state that it’s only the female ones that can
       heal using the saliva, and the male ones can coat their weapons with poison. Turns into
       a pool of acid when killed.
       I'm not sure, if I'm going for just one special ability here or to separate them into
       two depending on the player’s gender.
Bozak. Considered to be the magic-users of the draconian race. Can cast magic missiles, and
       the create will explode when killed.
Sivak. The only draconian type that can fly, they have the ability to shape-shift into their
       latest kill.
Aurak. The larger and more powerful draconian type. They can use mental attacks (in this case
       I'll just use the standard confusion spell and modify it). When killed the draconian
       will go berserk (add some temporary stats to the player), and after a few seconds it
       will automatically die.

Skills
----
Some minor weapon skills that fits the theme of the current draconians in Krynn
and magic skills that support their spells. The skills can be trained to level 40
since I would like the players to be able to improve their spells (to a lesser degree)
with their occ and layman slot.

Abilities
-----
All spells that uses the new magic skills will be have skill/stat cap. All of them will be
logged for further analysis.

Kapak draconian
  Spell 'Minor regeneration' or 'Minor weapon poison' - still undecided.

Bozak draconian
  Spell 'Lesser magic missile'
  Just a standard damage spell, minor damage and with the ability to resist it with
  magic resistance.

Aurak draconian
  Spell 'Confusion'
  Based on the new spell system, this spell can cause some random effects on a target.
  The spell should be able to be resisted based on magic resistance of the target and
  its int/wis.

Sivak draconian
  Spell 'Shapeshift'
  Based on the new spell system, this spell allows the caster to change farm into their
  latest kill. The spell doesn't grant any combat aid, but could still be an interesting
  abilities that can confuse in player fights or disrupt 'robotic' behavior.

Concerns
----
Dragon-slaying items works quite well on draconians, since they are dragonkin. I'm not
sure if this restraint can help reduce the tax slightly. Nevertheless, it might cause
some interesting episodes with player vs. player interactions. 

An alternative implementation could be to create the draconians with spells as race/layman
guilds and create the basic baaz draconian as a purely race guild with no extra abilities or
skills.






For every 6% of combat aid, 1% tax has to be charged.
A race guild may give up to 25% combat aid (4.2% tax).

  - guild abilities:
  o trip             100
    A special attack which will prevent the enemy from
    fighting for up to 60% of the time = 60% combat aid,
    since it uses a skill 50% tax reduction               5.0
  o see              100
    A special ability which allows players to see an
    enemy in the next room = little combat aid, 50% tax
    reduction for skill required                          1.0
  - extras:
  o a shop in the guild head quarters which uses the
    average of guild stat and trading skill as trading
    skill for guild members                               1.0
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Tax reductions:
    If a guild imposes heavy restraints on the guild members tax
    reductions are possible. This does not include restraints that
    balance special features, but restraints that handicap a guild
    member considerably compared to other players. Possible examples
    might be to make guild members incapable of drinking alcohol or of
    making it impossible for them to wield anything but non-magical
    knives while the unarmed combat skill is set permanently to 0.
    The maximum possible tax reduction is 2%, all in all. The tax
    reduction has to be documented in an aptly labelled file in the
    directory /d/<Domain>/open/GUILD/.
