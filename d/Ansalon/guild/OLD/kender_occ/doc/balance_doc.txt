COMBAT SPECIALS
===============

  SLING
  ~~~~~
    Files: /d/Ansalon/guild/kender_occ/sling.c

    This damage dealing ability requires a hoopak, pebble and proper
    wimpy to use.
    
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    The sling has been set to a maximum of 65% combat aid, but if it
    is used at the same time as dodge, then it is decreased to 48%.
    
    Frequency
    ---------
    The ability prep time has been set to 3 seconds and cooldown time
    has been set to 4 seconds, this should give the sling an average
    performance of once every 7 seconds.
    
    Hit chance
    ----------
    Tohit is set to be 90. This is calculated to be 82% hit chance
    according to 'man cb_tohit'.
    
    Penetration
    -----------
    The skill weight set for the sling is 51 dexterity, 28 wisdom and
    21 strength. The damage type has been set to bludgeon.
    
    Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
    
    
  DODGE
  ~~~~~
    Files: /d/Ansalon/guild/kender_occ/dodge.c
           /d/Ansalon/guild/kender_occ/dodge_obj.c
           
    This evade ability requires a proper wimpy to use.
    
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    The dodge has been set to 95% combat aid, but is lowered if used
    simultaneously as sling. The modified combat aid is 48%.

    There is an additional modification to the combat aid, if shields
    are worn or if not wielding a hoopak. The formula for shield deduction
    is sizeof(shields) * sizeof(shields) * 5 and not wielding a hoopak is
    penalized by 20.
    
    Frequency
    ---------
    The prep time for dodge is 30 seconds and no cooldown time has been
    set.
  
  TAUNT
  ~~~~~
    Files: /d/Ansalon/guild/kender_occ/taunt.c
           /d/Ansalon/guild/kender_occ/taunt_sh.c
    
    Taunt lowers all the defensive and weapon skills of an enemy, and
    sometimes forces that target to attack the taunting kender. This
    ability changes slightly depending on which other abilities are
    active.
    
    Hit chance
    ----------
    The success of the taunt is determined by a TASK_ROUTINE matching
    the kenders SKILL_AVG, TS_OCC, TS_WIS, SKILL_END, SS_TAUNT_SPECIAL
    against the enemy SKILL_AVG, TS_DIS, TS_INT, SKILL_END.
    
    Frequency
    ---------
    The taunt adds a value to the target depending on its success.
    The maximum result from a single taunt results in 13, and minimum
    being 5.
    
    The value determines the time of the taunt, as the value is
    decreased by 1 every 2 seconds, meaning it will at its peak expire
    after 26 seconds and the least being 10 seconds.

    The taunt has an ability cooldown time of 25 seconds and prep time
    of five seconds.
    
    Skill Effects
    -------------
    The aforementioned value is also the amount of skill levels lowered,
    with a minimum cap set to 5 and maximum cap set to 50.
    
    This ability can be stacked should there be enough kenders present
    to do so, and thus a maximum cap has been set. The more stacks you
    have, the less each new taunt applies.
    
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    The best case scenario has an 87% uptime, resulting in an average
    of 6 skill levels decrease and the worst having an uptime of 33%
    which results in an average of 1,5 skill decrease.
    
    Taunt + Dodge: While dodging a taunted targets attack, you have a
    chance (!random(value)) to increase the value by 3. This appears
    to keep the taunt value averaged at 7.
            Combat aid estimate: 5%
    
    Taunt + Sling: Has a chance to increase the damage done by a party
    members "did_hit" attacks to the taunted target by 25%. The formula
    bases the chance on the size of the team and amount of active taunts
    from slinging kenders.
    The formula is random((sizeof(team) * 10) / sizeof(kenders)) < 10.
    I have rated this ability to 20% combat aid (This is likely around
    14% caid increase while solo, but can potentially go up to 25% if
    the team is composed of enough kenders) and the skill decrease is
    estimated at 4% combat aid.
            Combat aid estimate: 24%
    
    Taunt + Sling + Dodge: No additional bonuses.
            Combat aid estimate: 4%
