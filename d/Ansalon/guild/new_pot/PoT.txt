NEW FEATURE:  ASPECTS OF THE PRIESTS OF TAKHISIS
Cleric guilds are traditionally classed as healer guilds. However healing guilds
without good offensive abilities are notoriously poor at gaining experience 
through combat in Genesis.

For the purpose of balance, having a guild that can heal, debuff, damage and
cast self-buffing spells would be either considered overpowered or incredibly
diluted ability-wise. It is the latter the Priests of Takhisis are currently
considered as.

To address this, it is proposed that the Priests of Takhisis and above are able to 
choose a "state" when they first enter the realms which allows them to focus their 
spells towards being effective at either healing or damage. They will be able
to choose an "aspect" of their goddess that reflects how they wish to play...
either the aspect of the Dark Warrior - focused on offensive abilities, or the 
aspect of the Dark Lady - focused on healing and debuffing abilities. Depending
on what aspect they choose, their spells will be modified accordingly.

ASPECT OF THE WARRIOR - positioned more for solo play with a melee combat focus
pCurse: cannot cast in Warrior Aspect
pHeal: -80 combat aid (70 combat aid max)
pEyes: cannot be cast on others
pSlow: unaffected
pScourge: unaffected
pBlind: increased cast time (x2)
pRestore: cannot cast in Warrior Aspect
pBless: unaffected (50 caid defensive spell)
pHammer: can cast in Warrior Aspect
pTalon: unaffected (250*/200/150 combat aid harm spell)
ppain: cannot cast in Warrior Aspect

ASPECT OF THE LADY - positioned more for group play with support and debuff focus
pCurse: unaffected (30 combat aid)
pHeal: unaffected (150 combat aid base / 250 if not using pBless)
pEyes: can be cast on others.
pScourge: unaffected
pSlow: unaffected
prestore: can cast in Lady Aspect
pBless: +50 caid (100 caid defensive spell)
pHammer: cannot cast in Lady Aspect
pTalon: -100 combat aid (150*/100/50 combat aid harm spell)
ppain: can cast in Lady Aspect
pBlind: unaffected

* 250 combat aid for ptalon is in the defence of Neraka. Classed as a 
  "special feature" that won't be counted towards the total combat aid
  cap.

       (deleted PDRAIN, PIMPRECATE, PMIRAGE)

The Priests of Takhisis are split into three main levels,
Cleric (CL), Priest (PR) and High Priest (HP) and a lot of sublevels
of no concern to this document.

Priests have a 'standing' with their goddess, ranging much like alignment
between -1200 and 1200. Higher standing influences the maximum combat aid
of healing and damage spells, while low standing results in spells being
set as HARD or FORMIDABLE.

Guild occupies both OCC and LAY slots which are both of clerical nature
