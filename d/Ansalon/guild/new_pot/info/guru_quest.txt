Priests of Takhisis guru quest (Arman, October 2018)

When a PoT reaches the 'priest' rank they will be able
to begin their guru quest, which gives them an extra
possible 10 levels in spellcraft.

'Possible', due to the skill scaling that occurs in
the PoT, progressing past superior master skill
essentially requires them to be of High Priest rank.

The guru quest starts in the Great Hall of Audience
in the Temple of Neraka,
/d/Ansalon/taman_busuk/neraka/temple/altar.c

Here a PoT may 'favour' a particular Dragonarmy and
support them in conquering the warfare battlefields
of Krynn.

At priest level, those who pray here will be provided
a vision of the five headed dragon - the Queen of
Darkness. One of the heads of the dragon will then
speak to the priest, commanding them to 'favour' that
army and conquer a random warfare location in that
armies name.

This needs to be done for each of the five armies.
A priest can change their favoured army at the Great
Hall at will.

Upon completing the fifth conquest, the Priest is
notified they may now access guru training.

This aspect of the quest is found in the guild
shadow, /d/Ansalon/guild/new_pot/shadow/occ_shadow.c

The bit set for this quest is Ansalon 3 19.
