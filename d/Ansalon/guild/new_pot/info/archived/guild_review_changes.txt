For the review and recode of the Priests of Takhisis (PoT), the 
following changes have been incorporated:

SKILLS:
Unchanged, with the exception of conjuration skill being increased
from a maximum of 25 to a maximum of 70.

TAX:
Updated spells, and the inclusion of combat aid tax have resulted in
tax increasing for the PoT from:

                     CL       PR       HP
Old tax:             13       20       22
New tax:             15       32       35

REMOVED FEATURES:
battle maneuver - an ability in the PoT shadow that allowed priests to
automatically move behind dragonarmy soldiers when in team with them.
Has been replaced with a recoded pMirage (now a blink base spell).

Mana-replenishing spells have been removed (pdrain) or recoded (pgem)
to provide different benefits.

NEW FEATURES:
PoT now use the new magic system and inherit the magic mana shadow.

When they reach PR rank a Priest may "specialise" in an aspect of the
Queen of Darkness - either the aspect of the Dark Warrior - focused on 
offensive abilities, or the  aspect of the Dark Lady - focused on 
healing and debuffing abilities. See "aspects" doc for more details.

** note - for opening all combat aid values listed below have been
** reduced by 10%.

SPELLS:

possible. The following is a summary of the changes to their spells:
