*Note: At the moment the maximum a clan member can improve
his axe skill is to superior master. I am not too keen on
giving them a higher axe skill, but have decided to have
that option open to me if my mind changes later.
 
** Once a member reaches the level of warrior of the clan,
they have the option of specializing in club rather than axe
at their trainer. If this option is taken, all axe skill
levels are removed, and the member then only has up to 30
levels in axe to train. Their club skill may then be trained
up to 90 (100).
 
Following the new tax system of multiple weapon styles, with
100/30 axe/club skill, the guild is taxed as follows:
 
     (70 / 60 * 1.5) + (0 / 60 * 0.5) * 2
               = 1.75 (which is what it is anyway)

CHOP SPECIAL ATTACK
====================

For all conditions, the cb_tohit value is 85 (78% chance to hit).
 
When under normal conditions, the dwarfs chop special is:
PENMOD((str/2 + wep_pen * 2) /2, chop_special_skill)
with the dwarf being able to do this approx once every 5 combat rounds.
 
    With a strength of 100, max-pen axe, and max chop skill, it would
    have a PENMOD(65, 100)
    = 426 penetration.
    combat aid: (20% * 426/280) * 78% = 23.73% combat aid. 
 

    Under conditions where the target is a racial enemy (eg goblin, troll,
     giant)
    the PENMOD changes to:
              
    PENMOD((str + wep_pen *2) /2, chop_special_skill)
    which with str->100, pen->40(max non magical axe pen), and chop skill->100
    
    PENMOD(90, 100) = 596 penetration.
    combat aid: (20% * 596/280) * 78% = 33.2% combat aid.
 
    For taxing this special we use the larger combat aid value of 33.2%,
    with the tax coming out as 33.2 /6 = 5.53 % tax

 
BATTLERAGE
==========
 
Some dwarven warriors are trained to take hits far more
effectively than other warriors. This tried and trained
technique is often fearfully referred to as 'battlerage'
by those who have seen such dwarves in battle.
 
Battlerage has two forms, one raises the AC of the player,
the other increases the offensive ability of the player
while decreasing their defensive capacity.
 
                        ---
 
The first is 'battlerage fiercely', where the dwarf shrugs
off attack after attack while battling an opponent. This
 benefit gives the dwarf an AC raise of:
 
((special_skill + constitution) /2) /20 + shield(if any)/10. With the 
highest (non-magical) ac value for shields being 40, and with maxed
skills, and 100 con, this gives an average raise of AC of 9.
This lasts 30 seconds, and it takes the warrior 10 seconds
to recover.
 
Tax for this:  with an increase of 9, and taking 40 as the
average ac, this gives the warrior a 22.5% combat bonus
(9/40). As it lasts for 30 seconds and takes 10 seconds to
recover this bonus is reduced to 16.88% (22.5 * 30/40). 
 
This works out to be 2.82% tax.
 
                        ---
 
A third battlerage option has been added:
'battlerage aggressively'.
When used, the dwarf takes a fully offensive posture,
throwing himself into the battle with a wild abandon. This
in effect decreases the time it takes to reset a chop from once 
every 5 rounds to once every 5 - (battlerage/50) rounds, so with
a maxxed battlerage skill, it drops to once every 3 rounds.

This changes the maximum combat aid of chop to:
(33% * 596/ 280) * 78% = 55.2% combat aid
                       = 9.21% tax

The increase in tax is 5.53% to 9.21%, an increase by 3.68% 

 
Only a battlerager or above may use this special (~90 guild
stat), and by using it they cannot make use of the defensive
abilities of the other battlerages. On the contrary, by
battleraging aggressively, their defence skill drops by
battlerage skill /3.  For this disadvantage, i have reduced
the tax of this special by 1%, making the tax 2.68%.
 
Note: Every time this special is used, the dwarf is drained
con/6 fatigue points.
 
The total tax for the battlerage specials is 5.50%

As only one of the two battlerage options can be used at once,
I have reduced the total tax for these specials by 1%, it
totalling at 4.50% tax.
 
DISADVANTAGES:
The specials are designed so that members of this guild use
axe (or club) and shields. As such this guild is disadvantaged
 if the members wants to use a two-handed axe (battlerage
become less effective), or the member wants to use a weapon
other than axe or club (unable to use chop/crush). Members
are thus restricted to the equipment they can use.
 
Another disadvantage of this guild is that they will be unable
to join any lay or racial guilds classified as magic-users
(note: This does not include clerical guilds).
 
TOTAL TAX:
Skill tax + chop special tax + battlerage =
8.58% + 5.53% + 4.50% = 18.61%
Clan member tax payed = 19%
