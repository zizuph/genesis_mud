Dwarven Doomseekers of the Hill Dwarves
========================================

BACKGROUND
==========
Dwarves are a proud people, and do not always cope well with failure
or personal tragedy - no matter how small or potentially insignificant
as perceived by tall people.

The loss of a single family member or a hoard of treasures is inconsolable
to a dwarf, a fate that can seriously unhinge their obsessive minds. Even
moreso, an act of cowardice or dishonour is a shame few dwarves can live 
with and end up being a burden far too heavy to bear - resulting in the 
only possible redemption being through forsaking all and seeking nothing
more than an honourable and glorious death - expunging the shame that has 
driven him to the path of a Doomseeker, and to be remembered in the saga's 
of his people for all time.

A Doomseeker is a dwarven clan member who has taken a death oath and dedicates 
the entire fibre of their being to the hardest and most destructive life of 
battle that they can possibly find. They travel into treacherous wilderness 
and deliberately seek out mighty battles, fearsome foes and overwhelming odds.

They forsake all armours and defensive special abilities, and enter battle with 
a frenzy that is fearsome and deadly.

JOINING AND LEAVING
===================
To become a Doomseeker a dwarf of the Neidar Clan must make a pilgrimage to the
Tree of the Ancestors south of the Tharkadan Mountain Ranges near the entrance
to the mountain dwarf kingdom of Thorbardin and carve their solemn death oath
into the tree (/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/rooms/ancestor_tree.c)

Any guild member can carve their name in the tree, although to access Tharkadan
they need to have completed the Disks of Mishakal quest and Rescue Prisoner
quest, so are likely to need to be of a minimum player size of at least hero.
If the dwarf is an Elder or Thane they need to forsake their leadership claims 
before taking the oath.

Guild stat gets reset to zero, and they start progression up a new title system.

Upon death, they revert back to a 'normal' Neidar member, guild stat again being
restored to the value they had upon joining the Doomseekers. Their deeds are
recorded on the Tree of Ancestors, and if they so choose they can again take
the death oath and return to being a Doomseeker.

This is handled in the existing Neidar Clan guild shadow 
(/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/shadows/occ_shadow.c) and the guild admin object 
(/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/lib/neidar_member_manager.c)

ABILITIES AND SKILLS
====================
Skills remain largely the same as those offered by the Neidar Clan
(/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/docs/docs.txt), with the exception being that two 
handed combat can be trained to 90 at the Tree of Ancestors.
(/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/rooms/ancestor_tree.c)

However abilities change dramatically.

                       -= ARMOURLESS (ALMOST) =-
Doomseekers are ineffective when they wear armours with the exception of 
robes/cloaks, and accessories (boots, earrings, breastpins, bracelets, rings, 
belts, necklaces). None of their offensive or defensive abilities will work
while wearing protective armours (except robes/cloaks).

The armour types banned are listed in /d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/guild.h under the
DOOMSEEKER_BANNED_ARMOURS define and managed through the check_valid_action
functions in the specials.

This makes them very susceptible to damage. This is a substantial disadvantage
of approximately -100 caid (based on 40 ac standard) but more realistically up  
to around 160 caid.

It also means that they can't wear shields, making their membership to 
Shieldbearers valueless.

Noting that a number of quests may require the wearing of specific armours,
we do not ban the wearing of armours outright. While wearing banned armours 
however specials do not function and Doomseekers feel a sense of heightened 
anxiety, resulting in an increase in panic and loss of mana through mental 
stress through the /d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/doom_regeneration_obj.c 
object, meaning armour-wearing would only be done in rare circumstances.

            -= CANNOT BATTLERAGE STUBBORNLY OR FIERCELY =-
Doomseekers can't make use of their defensive battlerages fiercely or 
stubbornly.
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/battlerage_fierce_dam_mod.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/battlerage_stubborn_dam_mod.c

Nor do they have access to the other defensive abilities of the Neidar:
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/defence_master_evade.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/armour_master_dam_mod.c

The only battlerage they can use is battlerage aggressively, which increases
chop/crush caid by 10% and making them more susceptible to damage through
    set_dam_mod_absorb(0) (a setting of zero apparently increases damage).

While Doomseekers have quite a few substantial disadvantages, they do have
some substantial strengths that balance out the defensive fragility:

                   -= ENHANCED CHOP/CRUSH =-
For 'normal' Neidar, chop/crush provides up to 45 caid (50 caid against racial
enemies) with a slow 10 second prep and cooldown time (total 20 second special).

Doomseekers have a much faster chop (5 second prep and cooldown time) that 
provides much greater combat aid that scales up the more damage they have
taken.

The base combat aid of chop is approximately doubled, and scales upwards as
a Neidar takes damage, modified by racial hatred and battlerage aggressively.

This is handled in /d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/doom_chop.c through the
query_combat_aid_modifier() function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Realistically the maximum caid outlined above can only happen when the
Doomseeker is at zero hitpoints, i.e dead, so will never actually be 
realised. Most combat aid will be realised at the 25% health or higher.

                   -= ENHANCED HEALTH REGENERATION =-
Doomseekers gain a benefit of a health regeneration buff, based on the 
standardised formula /d/Genesis/specials/std/regeneration_obj_base.c

The passive health object is loaded in the guild shadow upon logging in:
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/doom_regeneration_obj.c

This passive special relies on the BATTLERAGE_SKILL and TS_CON stat, and
provides 94 caid benefit.

Normally a cap is put on such regeneration specials of 25 caid, as it
becomes quite powerful when stacked with high armour. However considering
Doomseeker's wear no/little armour, this restriction has been lifted -
making them viable at taking damage (health tank), although not a 
good tank!

If any banned armour is worn, the heal benefits are blocked in the
query_regeneration_valid function of the special object, and instead
the player has a 1 in 6 chance every 4 seconds of having 20 panic added 
and mana reduced by 10 (half a harm spell mana cost).

                            -= FEARLESS =-
Immune to dragonfear through the addition of the property 
LIVE_I_NO_DRAGONFEAR to the shadow.

Also fearless in who they attack, with their desire to kill or be slain
by the mightiest of opponents, they also have the NPC_I_NO_FEAR property
set in their shadow.

These benefits are taxed at 0.5%.
