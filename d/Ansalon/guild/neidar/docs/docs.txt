** Once a member reaches the level of warrior of the clan,
   they have the option of specializing in club rather than axe
   at their trainer. If this option is taken, all axe skill
   levels are removed, and the member then only has up to 30
   levels in axe to train. Their club skill may then be trained
   up to 90(100). Note that since you can only train axe or club
   we only tax for one of them.

Tax calculation of skills: TAXABLE * TAX_MOD / 60 = TAX

Battlerage 
==========
Battlerage files located at :
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/battlerage.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/battlerage_fierce_dam_mod.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/battlerage_aggressive_dam_mod.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/battlerage_stubborn_dam_mod.c

Some dwarven warriors are trained to take hits far more
effectively than other warriors. This tried and trained
technique is often fearfully referred to as 'battlerage'
by those who have seen such dwarves in battle.
 
Battlerage has three forms, one raises the AC of the player,
another increases the offensive ability (improves chop/crush)
from the cost of losing some of their defensive powers.
With the last form they show the true sense of stubbornness,
standing their ground, focusing only on taking hits, doing
no offensive damage.
                         ---

The first battlerage form is 'battlerage fiercely', where the dwarf shrugs
off attack after attack while battling an opponent.

This benefit transfers 10% of the combat aid from the chop/crush attack to
a damage absorbtion effect offering extra 10% aid in defense. 
This makes up 0% aid total, and 0% tax.

The second battlerage form is 'battlerage aggressively', where the dwarf
works himself up to a point where he only cares about hurting the enemy,
and forget about protecting himself intensively.

This benefit gives the dwarf an increase in combat aid for Chop/Crush with 10%,
and make him more receptive to damage by -10%. 
This gives a total of 0% aid, and 0% tax.
The -10% loss is done by damage absorbtion but giving negative effect instead.

The third and last battle rage form is 'battlerage stubbornly', where the
dwarf plants his feet firmly in the ground, and put all his will power into 
taking hits from the enemies, and do not cause any offensive damage.

This benefit is meant to be used for 'super-tanking', where the dwarf himself
loses the chop/crush attack special, their offensive powers swinging a weapon.
For this they get 150% combat aid that goes to defending themselves.
This yields 0% combat aid, and 0% tax.

Combat Endurance
================
Tireless files located at :
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/shadows/tireless_sh.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/tireless_obj

These dwarven warriors are not unfamiliar with hard labor, and are therefore
uneffected by fatigue from combat.
When they are not in combat they will feel the fatigue drain like everyone else.
The combat aid for this ability is set to 0%.
The tax for this ability is set to 1%.

Neidar Stubborn
================
The Neidar Stubborn files are located at :
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/stubborn_dam_mod.c

This ability is always on.
Every 5 seconds they are in combat, they get more power to this ability.
The ability is a damage absortion, it doesn't prevent people to hit them 
(like evade or ac), but it reduce the pen of the hit. (less damage).

If they remain in combat for 90 seconds, they reach their full potential,
 which is 15% combat aid to the damage absortion.
15% Combat aid yields : 15/6% = 2.5% tax. 

Defence Master
==============
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/defence_master.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/defence_master_evade.c

The ability makes the dwarf able to boost his defence with 40% combat aid
with an evade. This lasts for 30 seconds, after which there is a 4.5 minute cooldown.

Since it lasts for 30 seconds, and have a cooldown of 4.5 minute, it yields a combat aid of:

280 per 5 seconds = 100% aid.   (maybe not the correct numbers)

280/5 = 56 hp per second. = 100 aid.

56 / 100 * 40 = 22.4 hp per second = 40% aid.

22.4hp * / second = 40% aid

4.5 minute = 270 seconds.

22.4 * 30 = 672 hp per 30 seconds.

Average hitpoints damage over the 270 seconds:

672 + 0 hp
------------  = 2.49 hp / second.
 270 seconds

Since 56 hp /s = 100 aid,

Our aid is then: 100/56 * 2.49 = 4.45% aid.

Tax : 4.45/6 = 0.74% tax.

Neidar Block
============
Neidar Block files located at :
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/effects/neidarblock_evade.c
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidar/specials/defend.c

Neidar block is an evade that gives 20% combat aid.

It can be used on the dwarf himself (20% aid) or to defend someone else 
with 10% aid.

20% aid yields: 20/6% = 3.33% tax.

Full Armour Bonus Protection
============================
Armour bonus files located at : 
/d/Ansalon/guild/neidars/specials/effects/armour_master_dam_mod.c

The dwarven warriors gain a defensive bonus from wearing a full set of armours.
A full set is defined as: helmet, body armour, leg protection, arm
protection, and a shield.

The bonus for wearing such as set is: 10% combat aid.

10% aid yields: 10/6% = 1.67% tax.

The neidars can obtain a maximum of: 50 + 15 + 4.45 + 20 + 10% combat aid = 99.45% ~ 100%

Tax from Combat Aid : 16.67%
Tax from Skills     : 10.25%
Other Taxes         :  1.00% (Tireless).
----------------------------------------
Total Tax           : 27.92% ~ 28%.
