 Because the shield slam was mastered by Neidars first, there will
 be a significant difference  in how it works for them and others.

   The special will be incorporated in the Neidar Clan specials
   ie. Neidar warrior will be not able to use chop or crush and 
   slam at the same time. Because of that the slam special will
   be more effective for them:

   - damage made by shieldslam performed  by Neidars will be a bit 
     more than damage caused by others  ( due to maximum trainable
     shield slam skill, which is for them 85),
   - The stun effect of a shieldslam performed by non Neidars will
     apply after reaching by them a certain guild stat (75), as it
     is much harder for them to gain effectiveness of a true 
     battlerager.

  Non Neidars may use shieldslam at constant rate.

  The stunning effect will work only against humanoids. 


  Damage formula for the shieldslam:
  ---------------------------------
  penet =  SS_STR + SHIELD_AC + ( SS_APPR_MON  * 100 ) / 60
  penet += MIN( MAX_GUILD_STAT_MOD, SS_LAYMAN )
  penet = ( penet * 5 ) / 3
  penet = ( penet * SHIELDSLAM_SKILL ) / 100
  penet = MIN( 800, penet )

  Where:    MAX_GUILD_STAT_MOD = 150, 
            SHIELDSLAM_SKILL   = 100 max for Neidars,
                               = 85  max for non Neidars
            SHIELD_AC          - armour class of a worn shield
           
  The special has 75% chance to hit and may be used approximately every 
  seven combat rounds.
