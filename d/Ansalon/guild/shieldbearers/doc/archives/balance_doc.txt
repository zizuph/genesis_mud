Guild Overview and Purpose (Taken from original draft proposal)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The guild idea of the Shieldbearers  is to be a layman option for
the Neidar dwarves.  It is commonly known that the most favourite
fighting style of the Clan members consists in using an axe (or a 
mace) and a shield.   While the most  people use shields only for 
defending themselves, dwarven warriors have mastered the skill of 
bashing their opponents to gain adventage in combat. 
However,  while the Clan creates quite tight structure, open only
for their own kin, the Shieldbearers sometimes teach the trick to
their good and trusted friends  and it is not rare sight to see a
gnome or even a kender (!)  running with  a shield slung over his 
back.

JOINING
=======================
The Neidar Clan member may become a Shieldbearer  at  any time he
wants, without the application process.  If it goes about others,
non-Neidars, gnomes and kenders, this is more difficult. One must
prove himself to be a real Neidar friend, what may not be so easy
especially for kenders.  The Thane and his Elders will surely not 
allow Mountain dwarves even to enter the village not saying about
teaching abilities to them so it is clear the dwarf, who wants to
join the guild, can not be a krynnish Mountain dwarf. After being
given a dwarven rune of friendship, the person may start the 
training.

Only dwarves, gnomes, kenders and hobbits are allowed to join.

TRAINING
=======================
The real warrior can not use a shield alone, because some enemies
may not be vulnerable to bashing.  Most of dwarves are skilled in 
using axes or clubs,  but kenders and gnomes often are not a true 
weapon masters.  That is why they will be trained in using an axe 
at the basic level (superior layman). Members will be also taught
how to appraise their enemies.
However, the main ability gained by new members is the shieldslam 
special.

    Axe              :  30
    Appraise Enemy   :  60
    Shieldslam       : 100 (85 for non-Neidars)

    This special attack was first used a long time ago when a dwarven
    warrior  dropped his axe in a battle with an ogre. Having nothing
    else to use,  he improvised,  slamming his wooden shield into the
    ogre and  dazing him long  enough for him  to pick up his axe and
    chop  the bugger to pieces.  Since  that day the shield  slam has
    been refined  and  improved on,  until  it  has  become  a rather
    effective  attack used by the hill  dwarves.  For slam to work, a
    shield must be worn by the attacking dwarf. The better the shield
    is, obviously the more effective the slam will be on an opponent.
    If the dwarf puts enough muscle behind it,  it usually produces a
    favourable result, that being the target seeing many tiny dwarves
    with shields running around their head.

    Reaching  the effectiveness of a true battlerager  is much
    harder for members who are not Neidars.  That is why they have to
    spend  more time  on training  before their  slam works with full
    strength (if ever).
    
    Shieldslam also has the possibility of stunning the opponent. The
    combat aid for the stun has been set to 22%. It is using the standard
    stun library. The cycle for the stun changes depending on the
    hardness of the hit. But it doesn't change the combat aid given. We
    actually set the aid in the file to 29%, because slam only connects
    75% of the time. So we have to adjust the stun aid accordingly in
    order to match the times in which they don't end up stunning the
    opponent.
    
    Power Slam
    ----------
    An option was added after further review of the Shieldbearers which
    allows them to optionally slam an opponent so powerfully that both
    the slammer and the target are stunned. Both are stunned at 100%
    combat aid for both parties (netting no difference or additional
    gain in combat aid). A stun of 100% combat aid means approximately
    half the stun cycle in stun time. Because both the power stun and
    the regular slam stun are applied on the target, the slammer
    will recover shortly before the target, giving it a very nice
    effect.
    
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
    and all other calculations are set. Slam has been set to a combat
    aid of 28%.
        
    Frequency
    ---------
    Shieldslam has a long reset time, partly because of its stunning
    effect. The frequency for slam has been set to the average of
    34 seconds.
    
    Shieldbearers will have the option of shortening their slam times,
    with a similar reduction in damage output and stun time. Thematically
    this has to do with charging a longer distance, versus charging
    a shorter distance. The shortened time will be 23 seconds. Combat
    aid is not affected by this.
    
    Hit chance
    ----------
    Tohit is set to be 80. This is calculated to be 75% hit chance
    according to 'man cb_tohit'.
    
    Penetration
    -----------
    Penetration is calculated using the person's strength, and
    guild stat stats portion, and the Appraise Enemy skill for the
    skill portion of it. Of course, penetration also depends on the
    weapon's pen. Finally, the Shieldslam special skill adjusts
    the ability downwards if they don't have sup guru skill.

    Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
