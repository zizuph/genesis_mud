Guild name : Shieldbearers of Iron Delving
Guild type : layman
Guild style: fighter

GUILD IDEA
=======================
The guild idea of the Shieldbearers  is to be a layman option for
the Neidar dwarves.  It is commonly known that the most favourite
fighting style of the Clan members consists in using an axe (or a 
mace) and a shield.   While the most  people use shields only for 
defending themselves, dwarven warriors have mastered the skill of 
bashing their opponents to gain adventage in combat. 
However,  while the Clan creates quite tight structure, open only
for their own kin, the Shieldbearers sometimes teach the trick to
their good and trusted friends  and it is not rare sight to see a
gnome or even a kender (!)  running with  a shield slung over his 
back.

JOINING
=======================
The Neidar Clan member may become a Shieldbearer  at  any time he
wants, without the application process.  If it goes about others,
non-Neidars, gnomes and kenders, this is more difficult. One must
prove himself to be a real Neidar friend, what may not be so easy
especially for kenders.  The Thane and his Elders will surely not 
allow Mountain dwarves even to enter the village not saying about
teaching abilities to them so it is clear the dwarf, who wants to
join the guild, can not be a krynnish Mountain dwarf. After being
given a dwarven rune of friendship, the person may start the 
training.

Only dwarves, gnomes, kenders and hobbits are allowed to join.

TRAINING
=======================
The real warrior can not use a shield alone, because some enemies
may not be vulnerable to bashing.  Most of dwarves are skilled in 
using axes or clubs,  but kenders and gnomes often are not a true 
weapon masters.  That is why they will be trained in using an axe 
and how to defend themselves at a journeyman level. Members will 
be also taught how to appraise their enemies.

However, the main ability gained by new members is the shieldslam 
special.

SHIELDSLAM
=======================
This special attack was first used a long time ago when a dwarven
warrior  dropped his axe in a battle with an ogre. Having nothing
else to use,  he improvised,  slamming his wooden shield into the
ogre and  dazing him long  enough for him  to pick up his axe and
chop  the bugger to pieces.  Since  that day the shield  slam has
been refined  and  improved on,  until  it  has  become  a rather
effective  attack used by the hill  dwarves.  For slam to work, a
shield must be worn by the attacking dwarf. The better the shield
is, obviously the more effective the slam will be on an opponent.
If the dwarf puts enough muscle behind it,  it usually produces a
favourable result, that being the target seeing many tiny dwarves
with shields running around their head.

Reaching  the effectiveness of a  true true  battlerager  is much
harder for members who are not Neidars.  That is why they have to
spend  more time  on training  before their  slam works with full
strength (if ever).

TITLES
=======================
The Neidar warrior, who decides to become a Shieldbearer will not
receive an additional title. Others will be presenting themselves 
with the following titles:

             Novice Shieldbearer of Iron Delving
             Shieldbearer of Iron Delving
             Trained Shieldbearer of Iron Delving

             Accepted Guard of Iron Delving
             Guard of Iron Delving
             Advanced Guard of Iron Delving
             Dedicated Guard of Iron Delving
             Famous Shieldbearer of Iron Delving
             Feared Shieldbearer of Iron Delving

             Elite Shieldbearer of Iron Delving
             Shieldwall Commander of Iron Delving


GUILD EMBLEM
=======================
As a guild emblem,   the Shieldbearer  receives a  buckler shaped
brooch.  The material,  the brooch is made of,  changes  with the
guild status of the member - from the wood, through brass, copper,
bronze, iron, silver and gold, steel to dwarven-steel.

LEAVING
=======================
Anyone,  who no longer wishes to be a Shieldbearer may return his
insignia ( buckler shaped brooch ) to Gorrthar.  He will lose any
experience that has gone for raising his guild stat. He will also
lose the ability to slam enemies with a shield.

There  is also possibility that non Neidars are not longer trused
by the Clan.  In this case,  Thane may remove rune of friendship,
and such person will soon find herself without the Shieldbearer's
insignia.
