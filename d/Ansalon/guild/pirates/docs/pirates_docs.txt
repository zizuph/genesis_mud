INTRODUCTION
------------
The Pirates of the Bloodsea is a small society that
has taken up residence in an underground cave system
on the Isle of Mithas. The pirates can, from their
headquarters, spread their corrupted operations
further into the Lands of Ansalon, plundering and
killing as they move forward. The pirates ultimate
goal is to completely gain control of the Bloodsea
and the port cities that surrounds the sea.


BECOMING A PIRATE
-----------------
Becoming a pirate is fairly easy. One must be voted
into the sociaty by the guild leader and if he/she
thinks you are worthy, you'll be invited to join.
The pirates are considered neutral since they both
attack dragonarmy ships and innocent merchant 
ships. This means that it's up to the persons 
OCC guild to decide weather he or she can join 
(Of course a neidar might have some  difficulties
joining since they are proud and noble warriors 
unlike the ruthless mercenaries of the Dragonarmies
or the mad gladiators of Athas).


TITLES
------
Since the Pirates don't really care about age or
wisdom, but instead respect brute force, their
titles in the society depends purely on your layman
guild stat. However the guild leader will get the
special title 'Legend of the Bloodsea'.


LOCATION
--------
The guild is hidden. In order to find it one must
first search the floor of an old warehouse. The player
will then notice a way down, that'll take him to the
sea beneth the pier of Nethosak. The sea there only
consists of 2 rooms. In one of the rooms, the player
can examine some stones or rocks, and he'll discover
a small cave, that he can enter, which will take him
to the underground pirate cave.
A non-pirate player will only have access to the
first two rooms of the pirate cave. Once he becomes
a member, they will be allowed to enter the rest of
the cave system. This will give them access to a 
droproom, a board, a shop, a training room and a
room where they can collect a free parrot, once
each day.
