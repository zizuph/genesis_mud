New camp of Kurinost
 
General background:
in 2010, Navarre and I discussed areas that might need an update and I was allowed to work on a replacement for the Kurinost Draconian Camp. The general idea was to redo the entire camp area and spice it up with a few small quests.

 
Location:
Silvanesti, eastern part, coastline, a few miles from the elven city Kurinost.


Situation:
Draconians from the Green Dragonarmy have invaded the coast and prepare to invade the Elven lands of Silvanesti. They have made a crude camp and generally poluted the area immensely with their waste, but they have not managed to enter Silvanesti. A huge and seemingly magical hedge has surrounded the forest and several patrols of draconians have already been lost in the forest.


Area:
Coastline, Camp, Forest.
The general area is made for smaller players. Originally it was to be made for larger players, much like the current (2015) camp of Kurinost, but my quests and the mobs I have created for this area are better suited for a smaller player.
 
The area is devided into three main areas. The coastline is a rough cliffside with a narrow trail leading up towards a pass. It is possible to find bushes with edible fruits/plants and in various places it is possible to climb up or down from the trail to find nests with eggs. These nests are guarded by nasty birds. On the trail it is possible to climb around a near invisible bend and climb down a ledge to a hidden shore on the coast. On this shore is a small dark cave in which the players can find a hobgo
 
Beyond the pass the player enters the dragonarmy camp that has been built around an old broken elven tower. In the center of the camp are large piles of refuge and waste. Further out there are small camps with tents and guards. On top of the hill is the broken tower, in which the players will be able to find Tyberus and some stronger guards.
The camp is manned by smaller draconians, Baaz, Kapaks and a few Bozaks. It is also manned by hobgoblin guards of my own creation, but fitting the theme and they will end up being about as strong as Kapak draconians.
Inside the camp will be a hobgoblin quartermaster, who will buy and sell equipment (maybe even draconian/hobgoblin items?  - see quests below), sour wine and stale bread/lumps of meat. There is a gnome locked up in a cell/cage, who will exchange your coins, but not deposit or withdraw (exception - see quests below).
 
South of the camp is a small passage down the hillside towards the forest of Silvanesti. There is little to find here yet, but it may be a place for future expansions. There will be a small draconian patrol guarding the hedge.


Quests and tasks: 
The quartermaster had employed a hobgoblin to transport supplies from the coats to the camp, but these supplies and the hobgoblin deserter are both lost. He wants the player to find the deserter and the supplies.

The deserter is hidden in a cave somewhere on the coastal cliffs. He claims innocense (of course) and also claims that he does not have the supplies, and he asks the players to gather some new supplies for him. These supplies are then delivered to the quartermaster for a reward. Supplies include berries, capers, cactus fruits, freshly killed rabbits (all found in the area).


Second task
The second task is to find a map for the quartermaster. You do not need to get the quest from the quartermaster to be able to find and deliver it, so you can actually find it before solving the first task. But the quartermaster does not give this quest until he has found his supplies. This second task may be a possible two-part quest, 1) find map for quartermaster, then 2) deliver it to Tyberus in tower).
 
Subsequent tasks
After the first quest is done (supplies), the hobgoblin deserter offers further smaller area-quests (find more supplies, kill # of draconians or hobgoblins in the camp (revenge!), bring a certain item to him, etc.). He will give the polayers a small sliver of steel as a reward (valuable currency on Krynn - Steel). This sliver can be used at the quartermaster to sell  draconian equipment or at the gnome banker to deposit coins. One sliver is enough to stay "friendly" with these two until logout.
These tasks are repetitive and if the player does not want to use the slivers they have a small silver/gold value and can be sold. They are dropped after the player quits from Genesis.
