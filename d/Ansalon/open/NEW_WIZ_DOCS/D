D. Area Coding in Ansalon:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Do NOT put rooms in your home directory, except your workroom. You are
   allowed a test room and/or a /temp directory for work-in-progress; the
   /private directory is for documents and code which you do not intend to
   implement for mortal use. If possible, area coding should be done in the
   proper subdirectory.

2) All areas should have a MAP doc in the appropriate subdirectory. The
   detail of the map is up to the coder, however all rooms of particular
   importance (ie: where a quest item may be found, hidden exits, etc)
   should be clearly marked in the map. A second copy of the map
   should be placed in ~Ansalon/doc/map/.

3) The file ~Ansalon/common/defs.h contains some useful definitions for
   Ansalon and Krynn. It is usually included in the <local.h> file 
   explained below.

4) Each area directory should contain one <local.h> file, perhaps more, if 
   there are additional subdirectories. These files should contain #include's 
   and #define's that are used within the area. This is where you place the 
   'connections' from the area to other areas in Ansalon or Krynn. In 
   addition, this file is used for the convenience of easily changing 
   pathnames in the event that directories are moved for some reason.
