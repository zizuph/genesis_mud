I. Wizard Second Characters:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Careful thought has gone into the formation of these rules. A sincere
attempt has been made at providing a guideline for wizard second behavior
that both the Admin of Genesis and the Wizards of this Domain can live
with. Ansalon's rules on wizard seconds are more lenient than those of some
Domains. This is because I believe that the Wizards of Ansalon are trust-
worthy. Should I be proven wrong, however, the rules will be revised.

1) Let me know who your second is. 
   -All seconds must either be listed with the 'second' command or
	listed in a file called "seconds" in your /private directory.
   -If you opt to use the file in your private dir, you must
	notify myself and the AoP (Player Arch) whenever you
	create or modify that file.
   -I would prefer that you had only one, but two are allowed.
2) Keep a low profile with your mortal.
   -Minimize posting on boards.
   -Stay out of guild politics.
   -No mortal second may be on a guild council.
3) Absolutely no Player Hunting.
   -Your mortal second may not attack another player.
   -You may 'assist' a teammate, however if they are attacked.
   -Your mortal second cannot be used to hunt or chase other players.
      Even following a player one room is considered an infraction of
      this rule.
4) Do not reveal to a mortal that you are a Wizard second, nor as a
     wizard, reveal the name of your mortal.
5) Do not discuss quests with other mortals.
   -Do not lead mortals through quests.
   -If pressed, you may give very broad (non-specific) hints, though in
      most circumstances it is best to say "I don't know" or "I don't
      remember".
6) You may -not- have your mortal and your wizard characters logged in at
     the same time.
   -This includes having one or the other 'link-dead'.
   -This does not pertain to your 'jr' characters. You may have both of your
      junior characters and your wizard logged in (at the same time) for
      testing purposes.
7) You may not use your wizard character to aid your mortal character in
     any way. Doing so will likely result in erasure of all your characters.
   -Do not tell mortals where to meet your mortal character.
   -Do not read quest documents with the intention of doing them with your
     mortal character.
   -Do not explore any area or feature of the game with your wizard
     character with the intent to gain information for your mortal character.
   -Do not create or use items or monsters for your mortal to sell or kill.
   -Do not use your wizard character to check the stats of your mortal
     character.
8) Your mortal may not be a member of any guild in Ansalon.
9) You may quest in Ansalon, but it must be done alone.
10) I reserve the right, as your Liege, to request that you play your mortal
   character(s) less frequently (or not at all).
   This would usually occur if:
   -You have left a coding project unfinished for an extended period.
   -Your code output is not satisfactory.
   -Your mortal has become too 'visible'.
   -The amount of time you spend logged in as a mortal is disproportionate
    to the amount of time you spend as a wizard.
11) You must notify me whenever a mortal character reaches wizard stats.
     In Krynn and many other domains, mortal seconds must stay below
     wizard stats. However, I will consider each case individually
     and decide if you will be allowed to play with such a high level
     mortal second.

If you have any questions about these rules or the reasoning
behind them, ask me.
Exceptions to these rules are possible, though not very likely.
Infringements are taken very seriously, with demotion and possibly
expulsion or erasure as punishments.
