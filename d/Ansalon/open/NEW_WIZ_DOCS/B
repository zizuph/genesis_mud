B. Manuals and Editor:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) The Genesis Administrators have manuals containing the rules which you
   (the coder) must follow, and which I (the liege) must enforce. Required
   for reading and occasional review/refreshers are:

         /doc/man/general/INTRO,  /INTRO_RULES, and /README

2) Manual and Source Code Manual.
   Man displays information from the different chapters of the reference
   manual section of the documentation library. A chapter, when given,
   applies to the keyword that follows it.
         For more information on the 'man' command, try 'help man'.
   Sman is used to access information on functions in files in the standard
   mudlib. Sman can be used to search for a specific function in a number
   of files, possibly by only giving part of the function name. Sman can
   also be used to locate a function in the source and list the appropriate
   part of a file.
         For more information on the 'sman' command, try 'help sman'
3) Editor.
   Many people do their coding at home and ftp (help ftp) or cut-and-paste,
   and use 'ed' for debugging and polishing purposes. The reason is that ed
   is a basic line editor, nearly identical to, and cryptic as, the UNIX
   ed.
        ed <filename>
        h   at the : prompt while editing a file gives helpful information
        .   exits an append (a) or other similar command resulting in a '*'
               and gets you back to the : prompt
