G. Wizard Tools:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  The following is a very usefull cmdsoul:
        ~mrpr/mbs/mbs
            -The main reader for boards in Genesis. "mbh mbs" gets you
                started on this one.
            -A few boards are mandatory reading:
                news, common, admin, ansalon.p, ansalon.d, krynn.d,
		lpc, idea, discuss, gamedriver, and tools.
            -If you have time, other <domain>.d boards can give useful
                info, as do the various guild boards

  These are the wizard toolsouls that I find useful:

        ~mrpr/ka/ka
            -Mainly for admins:
                "dtell <mesg>" is used for tells to all wizards within Avenir
                domain. This reduces the use of the wizline ("wiz <mesg>").
                "gmail" will clone a mailreader to you, enabling you to avoid
                going to a post office.
        ~caution/open/extra_soul
            -Has features useful in debugging and searches.
        ~mortricia/open/kit
            -A kit with useful conveniences; "help kit" for this.

    To obtain a toolsoul, type 'toolsoul <filename>'. Don't forget
    the 'newhooks' command to make the new commands available for
    you. Also, typing 'allcmd' will show you the commands associated
    with each soul.
