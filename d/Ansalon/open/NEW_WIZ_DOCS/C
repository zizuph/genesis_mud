C. Code Requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As Lord of Ansalon, it is my job to be sure that all code implemented in the
domain meets the regulations and standards set by the Administration. In
an effort to make reviewing code easier for me, and to maintain and hope-
fully improve the balance and quality of code in Ansalon, everyone is asked
to follow the rules outlined below:

1) Though it may not seem important to you, it is vital that everyone in
   the Domain, including you, is able to _read_and_understand_ the code you
   have written. Months after code has been completed, anyone should be able
   to review it and understand what it was that you did, and why. Changes to
   to the gamedriver, standard inherits, etc can require changes in Domain
   files; thus the insistance on clear, readable, documented code.

2) It is not required that you to fully document everything you code, but
   explanations of difficult/novel functions are highly recommended.

3) Put /* <your name> and <date> */ in all files that you create. This gives
   you the satisfaction of having made your mark, while at the same time
   showing who created what later on. The date of the most recent update/
   modification is recommended, but not mandatory.

4) Finally: Do not open a newly coded area to mortals unless I have reviewed
   and approved it. Keep me up-to-date with new additions/modifications to
   your area once it is open, so I won't have to break out my always useful
   demoting-machine.  :-)
