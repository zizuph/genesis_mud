E. Npc and Object Coding in Ansalon:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) All objects and npcs should be placed in directories associated
   with the dir structure and geography of the region (ie: 
   ~Ansalon/<area>/obj  and  ~Ansalon/<area>/npc), NOT in your
   home directory.

2) All npc's which you code that are humanoid in form (those
    with 2 arms, 2 legs, hands, etc.) should inherit M_FILE.
    All non-humanoid npc's (wolves, dragons, snakes) should
    inherit C_FILE. M_FILE and C_FILE are included in 
    /d/Ansalon/common/defs.h which should be included in the
    npc file.

3) There are specific rules on certain types of code in
   '/doc/man/general/*'. If, after referring to them, you are
   uncertain if it is legal to code something, ask me about it,
   or mail me.

4) Examples of everything from armours, to mobiles (npc's) to weapons
   are in the directory /doc/examples/* . In addition, feel free to
   look at anything in Ansalon (or Krynn if you have access) for 
   examples.

5) The directory /sys contains the main #include files. You should
   definately look at /sys/stdproperties.h . This helps you to make
   very specific and diverse objects by adding properties to them.

6) Be sure to 'man armour_guide' and 'man weapon_guide' to see what
   different types of armours and weapons are being used in the game.
   See ~Shire/open/npc_guide for help with coding monsters.

7) Every item coded in domain Ansalon will be consistent with the
   Administrative rules and in balance with the rest of the game.
   Magical and super-powerful objects will be kept to a reasonable limit.
