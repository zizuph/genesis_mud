---===WARRIORS OF THE NEIDAR CLAN===---

The main idea behind this guild is so that players can have
a chance to roleplay a typical dwarven warrior character,
something you can't really do at the moment. Also, giving the
races more meaning other than what stat bonus' they offer is
something else myself and a few others would like to see
added to the game.

Anyway, the guild idea comes from the dragonlance novels and
sourcebooks, a clan of dwarves that live throughout the plains
and hills of Ansalon, wandering the realms trying to make a
living in a harsh land.

For specific details about their skills and abilities, seek out
