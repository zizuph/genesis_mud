INTRODUCTION
============
The Pirates of the Bloodsea is a small society that
has taken up residence in an underground cave system
on the Isle of Mithas. The pirates can, from their
headquarters, spread their corrupted operations
further into the Lands of Ansalon, plundering and
killing as they move forward. The pirates ultimate
goal is to completely gain control of the Bloodsea
and the port cities that surrounds the sea.


BECOMING A PIRATE
=================
Becoming a pirate is fairly easy. One must be voted
into the society by the pirate King/Queen or one of
the recruiters, also known as Press Gangers.
If one of these persons think you are worthy, you'll
be invited to join.
The pirates are considered neutral since they both
attack dragonarmy ships and innocent merchant 
ships. This means that it's up to the persons 
OCC guild to decide whether he or she can join 
(There are of course some guilds that you could 
imagine will not allow their members to join, such
as the shadow union that can not drink alcohol,
but the code doesn't prohibit them joining if they
seek a roleplay challenge.)

TITLES
======
Since the Pirates don't really care about age or
wisdom, but instead respect brute force, their
titles in the society depends purely on your layman
guild stat. However the guild leader will get the
special title 'Legendary Pirate King/Queen of the Bloodsea',
and the recruiters get "Press Ganger".


LOCATION (/d/Ansalon/guild/pirates)
===================================
The guild is hidden. In order to find it one must
first search the floor of an old warehouse. The player
will then notice a way down, that'll take him to the
sea beneth the pier of Nethosak. The rooms below the
pier, consists of 2 rooms only. In one of the rooms,
the player can examine some stones or rocks, and 
he'll discover a small cave, that he can enter,
which will take him to the underground pirate cave.
A non-pirate player will only have access to the
first two rooms of the pirate cave. Once he becomes
a member, they will be allowed to enter the rest of
the cave system. This will give them access to a 
droproom, a board, a shop, a training room and a
shop where they can purchase monkeys and parrots
(like in Neraka).

 Tax is (Taxable Skills / 60): 280/60 = 4.67% Tax for skills.

 The guild specific skill SS_SPECIAL_STAGGER trains to 100.

ABILITIES
=========

Stagger:
--------
The stagger special is the only combat aid the pirates has.
It was originally coded by Elmore who decided to give pirates an
ability to stagger and dodge the hits.

It's common knowledge that pirates drink alot, and when they
do, they begin to stagger. Stagger is added to
the guild shadow, and yields a change to dodge on 1-1 fight of 20%.
Stagger is only possible if the pirate is more then 50%
intoxicated. If he's not, nothing will happen.

For fighting more than 1 enemy, this change of dodging is distributed
over the amount of enemies, thereby ensuring correct combat aid at 
all times.

For smaller players, the resolve task doesn't work too good, for
players with <100 in avg and <100 dex, will gain a small +15 in success
bonus.

Dodging 20% of the time requires a tax of: 20% / 6 = 3.33% Tax.

Pbash, attack special with bottle
---------------------------------
Pbash is an attack special that adds some atmosphere to the pirates.
It makes their combat even more pirate like than with the stagger.
Pirates who are always drinking, are running around with a bottle of booze,
they are now able to bash their enemy over the head with their bottle
in combat. Thereby adding a lot of atmosphere to the pirate.

The attack special uses cb_tohit as instructed, and uses a to_hit value of
75. "man cb_tohit" tells that using a tohit value of 75 results 
in a combat aid reduction of 29%.

The attack special is dependant among other things on the SS_SPECIAL_STAGGER skill.

F_PENMOD((100/4 + 100/2 + 200/2)/6, 100/2) = F_PENMOD(29, 50) = 154.

The attack has a preparation time of: 1 + random(4) = 3.
The reset time is: 15 + random(4) = 17.
1 round = 6 seconds.
20 seconds means it is used every 4 rounds = 25% use.
Standard PEN is 280.

Calculation:
    154 / 280 * 25% = 13.75% combat aid.


Applying reduction:

Combat aid = 13.75% - (0.29*13.75)% = 9.77%

6% combat aid = 1% tax.

9.77% / 6% = 1.63%


Which leaves the guild with a total of: 4.57% + 3.33% + 1.63% = 9.6%.

Rounded up, the final tax of Pirates is: 10%.
