Ansalon is a domain based on the works of Tracy Hickman and Margeret Weis, those being the Dragonlance novels. Ansalon was originally a domain that branched off from the original Dragonlance domain, Krynn, to allow for more coders to work on this diverse world. But as wizard numbers have fallen it has been decided that Ansalon is to be frozen, and for Krynn to take on the coding and development responsibilities of the entire area.
