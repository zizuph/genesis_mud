Arman is the dwarven liege of Ansalon, and coder of Flotsam and the surrounding forest lands, as well as Kalaman and its surroundings. He was responsible for the bringing together of the hill dwarf tribes into one clan, as well as the creation of the kender race along with Lord Aridor. He opened the gates of Sanction to new visitors, as well as convinced Highlords Ariakas and Kitiara to start actively recruiting. Arman is the present overseer of all the other projects in this domain.

Any concerns, questions or ideas should be directed to him.
