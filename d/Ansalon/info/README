                      The Ansalon Domain.
                      -------------------

     In the dark ages of ancient times the creation of a continent
called Ansalon in a world named Krynn was started. Many immortals
created by Rastlin the quite magnificent, joined forces in their
effort to create and shape the land of the DragonLance saga. It was
a glorious time, and slowly the lands of Krynn began to come into
existence. Many immortals joined and left in the process, but the
lands kept growing. So numerous were the immortals that joined in 
the creation that it was decided to expand the immortal realm above
Krynn. The domain of Ansalon was created and the venerable Macker,
better known as Majere, was given the title Majere, the almost as
magnificent as the quite magnificent Rastlin. Majere worked hard to
breathe life into this new domain, but he was summoned by a greater
power and had to leave his creation. A young apprentice to Aridor 
the most liquid master of watery speach, was assigned to the task
of leading the creations within this new domain. Jeremiah the not
so humble as Rastlin the quite magnificent wished he would be, was
the name of this fledgeling. He summoned immortals from near and
far, mostly far, and together they continued the work of creation.
Side by side with the sister domain, Krynn, these two domains work
hard to create the world of the DragonLance saga that we all share
a common love for. May our work be rewarded by the enjoyment of 
many a mortal travelling and living in our creation.
