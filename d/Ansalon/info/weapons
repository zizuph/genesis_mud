MAGIC items in Ansalon.
=======================


Weapons:
--------

Draco Dagger (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam/obj/weapon/draco_dagger.c)
    Creator : Arman
        This is a very powerful dagger. It has been magically
        enchanted/enhanced by the evil clerics of Takhisis, to
        make it penetrate even the best armour, thus giving it
        a high pen (and hit) value for a dagger(knife).
        (This weapon is unique. There will be only one per reboot)
        (Hit: 32, Pen: 28)
        This weapon can be wielded in any hand.
        Wielded by : This dagger is wielded by Gakhan the draconian.
                     (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam/living/gakhan.c)

Spiked Steel Tessto (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam/obj/weapon/tessto.c)
    Creator : Arman
        The tessto is a large six foot long club. It is fairly
        highly enchanted. Tesstos are traditionally weapons
        wielded by the minotaurs of the Bloodsea, and are thus
        quite powerful and large. This tessto has been altered
        into a steel form and enchanted for greater hit and 
        penetration, as well as to decrease what woudl be an
        extremely heavy weapon. Even with this enchantment, a
        titanic strength is needed to wield it. Its size
        also restricts what sort of race can wield it. It is
        far too large for the likes of hobbits, dwarves, 
        goblins and gnomes to wield.
        (Hit: 44 Pen: 49)
        This weapon must be wielded in both hands.
        Wielded by: Half-ogre bodyguard.
                   (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam/living/half_ogre.c)

        Note: This is not an easy club to get. Apart from taking
              a hard fight to get the weapon, getting to the
              wielder of this weapon is equally difficult, having
              to break into an Inns appartment.(This involves
              the use of open locks, climb and acrobatics.)
        Limited to 5 in the realms.


 Mighty dwarven cleaver (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam_forest/obj/weapon/cleaver.c)
     Creator : Arman

         The mighty dwarven cleaver is a very sharp and well
         balanced axe. This weapon was forged long ago before
         the cataclysm by dwarven priests of Reorx and is an 
         item treasured by the dwarven nations. During the
         Kinslayer, or Dwarfgate, Wars, weapons like this were
         used by the great soldiers of the Daewar clan, and thus
         many still lye with their dead owners near the site of
         the ruins of Skullcap.
         It is a one handed weapon, but its enchantment allows
         it to the damage of the finest two-handed axe. Its
         enchantment also prevents those of goblinkind to wield
         it.
         (Hit: 40, Pen: 40)
         Wielded by Shale the hill dwarf.
         Limited to 10 in the realms.

 Solamnian broadsword (~flotsam/obj/weapon/ksword.c)
      Creator : Arman

          This weapon was crafted long ago during the Age of
          Right, after the formation of the order known as the
          Knights of Solamnia. One was crafted for each of Vinas
          Solamnus's generals, this particular blade probably
          coming from the Trueheart or Solanius lines, whose
          family swords were lost during the Third Dragonwar.
          This blade has been enchanted so that when it is wielded
          by a knight of honour, its hit/pen is increased from
          35/35 to 42/42.
          (Hit 35/42 : Pen 35/42)
          One handed, wielded in any hand.
          Wielded by Kernan, the Dragonarmy officer (~flotsam/living/
          da_officer.c)
          Limited to 7 in the realms.
 

 Green-tinted longsword (~flotsam_forest/obj/weapon/g_slayer.c)
      Creator : Arman

          Known in ancient times as Goblinbane, this green-tinted
          longsword is made of an unusual emerald coloured steel.
          It was crafted
          long ago for a noble warrior in the goblin wars, and
          has been enchanted to slay those of goblin heritage.
          Most goblins cannot thus wield it. The blade does
          grudgingly allow those goblins of high morals to use
          it though. The blades hit/pen increases against goblinoids.
          (Hit 34/48 : Pen 30/48)
          Found in the dragons lair.  Limited to 5 in the realms
          as it can be quite a powerful weapon in the right hands.

  Frost giant's waraxe (~estwilde/obj/weapon/frost_axe.c)
       Creator : Arman

          These axes are wielded by two frost giants
          who once a blue moon attack the clan halls of Iron
          Delving in a revenge raid. Thus the axes are also
          quite rare (probably on average <1 per arma).
          Frost giants are pretty tough. The axe is two-handed.
          (Hit : 44, Pen: 50)
          (note: the frost giant's warhammer is identical to this axe
          however is a club instead ~weapon/frost_club.c)

 ancient dwarven battleaxe (~estwilde/obj/weapon/teregul_axe.c)
       Creator : Arman

          This battleaxe was forged long ago by dwarven smiths
          and blessed by priests of Reorx under the glow of his
          red star during the Age of Dreams. As far as weapons
          go, this one is extremely heavily enchanted, with the
          ability to hit and do damage well beyond even the finest
          of forged weapons. Many heroes have carried this axe, the
          latest of which was the dwarven hero Teregul Skybolt of the
          hill dwarves. This axe is rewarded to the dwarf who 
          completes the Neidar guru quest. A player can only do this
          quest once, so it is very rare.
          (Hit : 45, Pen : 50)
          One-handed, quest reward. 

 Flaming two-handed longsword (~flotsam_forest/obj/weapon/rev_sword.c)
       Creator : Arman

          This is a weapon consisting only of a two-handed
          hilt. Its blade consists totally of a deep red flame
          that is as affective as a normal bastard sword.
          The blades enchantment effectively is a level 1
          light source.
          (Hit: 26, Pen: 22)
          Is a sword wielded in both hands.


  Half-moon bladed waraxe (~flotsam/obj/weapon/moon_axe.c)
        Creator : Arman

           This axe has been crafted by a very good weapon
           smith, but its magical abilities come from a
           curse laid upon the one who first wielded it.
           That warrior had his spirit trapped inside the
           weapon. The curse enchants the axe to do greater
          damage (the axe being strenghtened to keep the 
           spirit within), but the main benefit of it comes
           when the axe is wielded by a female. The spirit
            of the warrior will randomly come to the 
           warrioress' aid, draining life force from her
           enemies (hp draining special).
           (Hit: 30, Pen: 37)
           Wielded by the minotaur firstmate on the ship
           that travels between Sparkle and Flotsam.
           (~flotsam/living/minotaur.c)
           It can be wielded in any hand.


   black double-bladed dagger (~flotsam/obj/weapon/carnage.c)
         Creator : Arman

            This powerfully endowed magical dagger is the love child
            of the evil elven sorcerer Satania. Being sentient, this
            blade only allows those of -300 alignment to wield it. Its
            forging makes it as fine as any non-magical dagger to hit,
            while its enchantments makes it as damaging as a finely
            forged broadsword.
            This daggers damage messages have been modified.
            It can be found on Satania, who can be found in one
            of the quarters of the ship the Golden Lion
            (~flotsam/living/satania.c).
            (Hit: 20, Pen: 34)
            It can be wielded in any hand.
            Limited to 5 in the realms.

   runed scimitar (~flotsam/obj/weapon/sat_scimitar.c)
         Creator : Arman

            The runed scimitar is of strange and exotic make. Consisting
            of a huge curved blade and a small one-handed
            hiltless handle, it looks almost unwieldable. That
            is where the enchantment comes into play, balancing
            the blade so that it can be easily wielded in one hand.
            This blade penetrates armour as any heavy scimitar
            would, but strikes with amazing accuracy.
            (Hit: 39, Pen: 27) 
            It is found on Satania of the Golden Lion (as above)
            It can be wielded in any hand.
            Limited to 5 in the realms.

   gnarled wooden staff (~flotsam_forest/obj/weapon/mag_staff.c)
          Creator : Arman.

          This is the staff of Fermammon the Wise, a renegade
          wizard of reasonable power (~flotsam_forest/living/ferm.c)
          When wielded by someone with 70+ SS_FORM_ENCHANTMENT
          skill, they may, by chanting a certain command word,
          call upon its powers, which include an increase in
          polearm skill (up to superior journeyman),
          and a minor damaging special. The pen is also increased
          for the duration of the enchantment (10 minutes). Calling
          this ability costs 200 mana points.
          (Hit: 40, Pen: 20/42-45)
          It is two-handed.

   impressive bronzed partisan (~kalaman/obj/weapon/br_spear.c)
          Creator : Arman

          This polearm is wielded by the gatemaster who guards
          the Harbour gates of Kalaman. This weapon has been
          enchanted mainly for the defence of the city, thus
          offering the wielder added ability to parry (raised
          by 7 levels). This weapon also has an increased ability
          to do damage, while its hit is rather standard for
          a well-crafted two-handed polearm.
          (Hit: 35, Pen: 47)
          It must be wielded in both hands.

   golden sceptre (~kalaman/obj/weapon/sceptre.c)
          Creator : Arman

          This mace like weapon has been enchanted so that it
          is easier to wield, making it easier to strike at 
          targets. It is wielded by the Lord of Kalaman
          It has been altered so that it cannot be
          forceably removed from the wielders hand. Only 3 can
          exist in the realms at any time.
          (~kalaman/living/calof.c).
          (Hit: 40, Pen: 35)
          It can be wielded in any hand.

    nordmaarian warhammer (~kalaman/obj/weapon/enforcer.c)
          Creator : Arman

          This warhammer, 'Enforcer', has an enchantment that makes
          it far more effective for people who wield it who fight
          for a cause (ie one side of the alignment spectrum or the
          other).  It has a base hit/pen of 34/34, however this
          increases by (absolute value (alignment / 100). It has 
          an aversion to chaos, so kender, dwarves, and minotaurs
          (children of the Graygem of Gargath) cannot wield it.
          It is the other optional weapon for Calof.
          (Hit: 34/46, Pen 34/46)
          It can be wielded in any hand.           
        

     kestrel-marked longsword (~balifor/steppe/obj/longsword.c)
          Creator : Arman

          This longsword is the weapon wielded by Viridian,
          The master swordsman from Valkinord. (~steppe/living/warrior)
          Its enchantment gives it higher hit and pen for a one
          handed weapon, as well as being strengthened so that its
          set_likely_dull and set_likely_break are set at 0.
          (hit: 44, pen: 39)
          Wielded with the right hand.
          Limited to 5 in the realms.

   silver-tipped ironwood hoopak (~flotsam_forest/obj/weapon/mag_hoopak.c)
          Creator : Arman

          This hoopak is the one that was once
          wielded by the famous Uncle Trapspringer.
          It was blessed by a friendly mage, giving it a bonus
          to any kender wielding it in pen/hit.
          (hit: 33/52, pen 25/42)
          Wielded in both hands.
          Found in a troll lair in the flotsam forest.
          Guarded by a nasty river troll.
          (~flotsam_forest/living/troll.c)

     life-stealer blade (~taman_busuk/sanction/obj/weapon/baksword.c)
          Creator : Alustrial (fixed up by Arman)

          This unholy blade was enchanted by dark priests
          long ago, and given into the service of Bakaris,
          lieutenant of the Blue Dragonarmy (~sanction/
          npc/bakaris.c)
          The enchantment drains life, giving it an increased 
          hit/pen. Only those of less than 100 alignment
         can wield it, otherwise they suffer 800 + random(200)
         damage.
         Hit: 50, pen: 47/50 two-handed sword.

     heavy spiked mace (~goodlund/kendermore/obj/ogreclub.c)
          Creator : Gwyneth

          This very heavy club has been enchanted to strike
          deadly blows on the enemy, giving it an increased
          pen. It is wielded by the Ogre Trainer, Vincint
          in Kendermore (~goodlund/kendermore/npc/vincint.c).

          Hit: 28, pen: 48, one-handed club.


     ancient dragon-coiled halberd (~common/wep/pole/aurak_halberd.c)
          Creator : Elmore

        Forged by the smiths of Takhisis in the Abyss this
        weapon was crafted for each of the officers in the
        Red Dragonarmy, as a gift from their General. 
        The halberd is affective against an mounted enemy.
        And if wielded by a dragonarmy member the halberd
        will become more effectively in battle. It also
        has a commandword, and once it is spoken it'll add
        some speed to the wielder. The commandword can only
        be spoken if the wielder has max mana, if he has the
        polearm will drain 1000 mana.

        Normal                   : Hit: 40, pen: 40 halberd.
        RDA/Draconian            : Hit: 40, pen: 42 halberd.
        Normal vs Mounted        : Hit: 45, pen: 40 halberd.
        RDA/Draconian vs Mounted : Hit: 45, pen: 42 halberd.

     dragon-bladed roncone (~common/wep/pole/roncone.c)
        Creator : Torqual

        Weapon of might, has been blessed by Queen herself for her
        beloved children - auraks. Everyone else who will try to use
        it and the weapon becomes cursed. Also the more skilled in
        using the weapon you are, the more dangerous it will become
        (to wielder ofcourse). The weapon also looses its quality
        the more skilled you are.

        Base			: Hit: 45, pen: 45
        Auraks			: Hit: 50, pen: 50
        Modification	 	: Per each 20 skill points in polearm 1
				  hit/pen is reduced (see code for details)
        Minimal			: Hit: 40, pen: 40
        Side note		: limited to 5, wielded only by aurak
				  leader in flotsam (flotsam/living/aurak_leader)

     ornate hacchak (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/obj/weapon/seeker.c)
        Creator : Elmore

        This kender weapon is a quest reward for solving the hacchak
        quest in Mithas. The weapon is quite amazing since the wielder
        can change the grip around it, to either a polearm, club or
        axe. IF the wielder is a kender the weapons stats will
        improve.

        Base			: Hit: 49, pen: 39
        Kenders			: Hit: 55, pen: 45
        Side note               : Restricted to 2.

    carved quickwood hoopak (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/obj/weapon/hoopak.c)
        Creator : Elmore/Belnop

        This polearm gives any kender a 200% speed bonus and raises the     
        hit and pen to: 47,47. It also uses non-stadard combat messages and 
        if examined closely the wielder might find out that it has 4 emotes 
        aswell, namely: 'hswing', 'hrun', 'hspin' and 'hfire'.              
        Because of the number of smaller items that can be examined on the  
        weapon. I've made a different Examine procedure. One must study the 
        item to get a description, like: 'study second cat' to get the      
        description of the second cat. The hoopak is extremely hard to
        get, first a team my be gathered to kill an ancient black dragon.
        If they succeed, they will have to remove some roots from within
        it's lair(Must have a decent strength to do this). Once this is
        done a player with no more then 70 in Con can enter a small crack
        and retrieve the hoopak from the corpse of a kender.

        Base			: Hit: 39, pen: 39
        Kenders			: Hit: 52, pen: 47
        Modification	 	: +200% in speed if wielder is kender.
        Side note		: limited to 2

    serrated obsidian halberd (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/obj/weapon/wound_halberd.c)
        Creator : Elmore

        This polearm was once created by the High Priests of Istar to aid 
        them and their guards in battle. However this one has been blessed
        by the evil god Sargonnas, thus no good-aligned persons can wield
        this weapon. The blade is serrated and this makes it very hard to
        dull. Suranir, the priest of the village of Nethosak, has 
        furthermore enchated the halberd giving it an improved combat 
        speed. This weapon can cause wounds on people, which bleeds and 
        hurts the player. It also improves the wielders speed.

        Base			: Hit: 49, pen: 44
        Modification	 	: +100% in speed. Can't be wielded by goodaligned.
        Side note		: limited to 2


   black mace/flaming black mace (~dargaard/obj/weapon/black_mace.c)
       Creator : Arman
       This is the darkly enchanted mace wielded by the skeletal warrior that
       once every few weeks leads an attack on the Neidar Clan guildhall.
       It is darkly enchanted, with higher hit/pen than normal, as well as its
       description changing to flaming black mace when wielded.
       (hit: 42  pen: 42)
       Wielded any hand

   holy blade (~dargaard/obj/weapon/mishakal_blade.c)
       Creator: Arman
       This is a holy blade once wielded in the Age of Dreams by a disciple of
       the old goddess, Mishakal. During the Cataclysm the blade was broken, 
       and all that survived was its blue-steel hilt (~dargaard/obj/hilt.c)
       This hilt is in the possession on an undead warrior who haunts the
       entry of Dargaard Keep.  Players who recover the hilt and take it to
       Mishakal's temple in Xak Tsaroth (/d/Krynn/xak/tempchamber.c) have the
       sword restored to its former glory. The enchantment of this blade
       is such that it becomes more powerful when wielded by warriors of good.
       Its normal hit/pen is 35/35, with an pen increase of alignment / 150
       and hit increased by alignment / 100 (max of 47/43).
       The blade glows with a holy light that can disperse some of the 
       deepest darkness (light property set at 6). It also does not dull or break.

       (Hit/Pen:  35 + (alignment/100) / 35 + (alignment/150))
       Wielded in the right hand.

   three-headed iron flail (~balifor/flotsam_forest/obj/weapon/flail.c)
       Orginally made by a blacksmith in old Istar who gave it as a gift
       for the priesthood who noticed it got dented much too quickly
       and enchanted it with powerful blessings as to not dull so
       quickly. Spikes on the heads will cause more damage on unarmoured
       enemies.

       Hit 38 + random(4), pen 33 + random(3) that will remain constant
       throughout armageddons, should the flail survive it.

   blackened bastardsword (~kalaman/obj/weapon/bastardsword.c)
       Enchanted with magic to withstand corrosion better than normal
       swords. If hitting an unarmoured bodypart of an enemy the damage
       done will increase with 7%. Due to its length, this bastardsword 
       is a bit difficult to handle. Not only must the wielder be
       proficient in swords to be able to wield it, he must also be
       strong enough. It can thus be wielded either as a singlehanded
       weapon (if even stronger) or doublehanded.

       Hit 42 + random(4), pen 41 + random(4) that will remain constant
       throughout armageddons, should the sword survive it.

       If wielded doublehandedly, hit will decrease by 5 and pen will
       increase with 5.
       Limited to 3 in the realms.

   golden-hued bastardsword (~kalaman/obj/weapon/g_bastardsword.c)
       Enchanted with magic to withstand corrosion better than normal
       swords. While not as sharp as its brother, that has been
       weighed up by its sleekness giving its wielder better
       manouverebility in battle (LIVE_I_QUICKNESS + 15). Not only must
       the wielder be proficient in swords to be able to wield it, he
       must also be strong enough. Due to being a true bastardsword
       it can be wielded either as a singlehanded weapon (if even stronger)
       or doublehanded. To be able to wield two bastardswords
       (single handedly) would require a master warrior, skilled both
       in swordsmanship and two handed combat.

       Hit 46 + random(2), pen 37 + random(2) that will remain constant
       throughout armageddons, should the sword survive it.

       If wielded doublehandedly, it will decrease by 5 and pen will
       increase with 5.
       Limited to 5 in the realms.


    elaborately-carved greatsword (~taman_busuk/mountains/obj/greatsword.c)
       Creator: Arman
       This weapon is a massive two-handed blade with enchantments
       that make it even more powerful. It is extremely effective
       against creatures that fear fire (undead, trolls, frost giants,
       yetis, and thanoi). It is quite heavy (20kg) and is limited to 3.  
       It requires a reasonable strength to wield (strength of 90).
       It is wielded by a powerful ex-knight of Solamnia        
       (~taman_busuk/mountains/living/fallen_knight)

     flaming crystal axe (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/obj/weapon/crystalAxe.c)
       Creator: Elmore
       A powerful artifact from Ergoth. It is sensitive to alignment, changing
       its description depending on its wielder (holy/flaming/unholy crystal
       axe).  The holy and flaming versions give out 1 level of light.
       1 in 5 of its hits is a special attack, which heals the wielder (if good)
       or further damages the target (if evil).
       Dwarves have a harder time to wield this weapon. They need a wisdom of
       135 to wield it. Further, one must have an axe skill of 75 to wield it.
       It is occasionally wielded by the troll shaman in the forest outside of
       Nethosak.
       One handed.
       Hit:  40
       Pen:  50
       Limited to 1 in the game.

     granite war maul (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/obj/weapon/war_maul.c)
       Creator: Elmore
       A heavy granite war maul, enchanted by the troll Shaman on the isle
       of Mithas to do more damage to targets. For those strong enough, they
       may be able to wield this weapon in one hand.
       Two handed*
       Hit:  40
       Pen:  45
       Limited to 3 in the game.  

     elaborate sabre (~goodlund/bloodsea/obj/sea_slayer.c)
       Creator: Arman
       A heavy sabre, enchanted by the sea wizards of Saifhum. It has been enchanted
       to be particularly deadly to sea monsters, particularly minotaurs, sea serpents
       sea-elves, sea dragons, and sharks (increased hit/pen for those creatures).
       One-handed
       Hit:  34 (48)
       Pen:  30 (48)
       Limited to 7 in the game.

     azure-steel spear (~goodlund/bloodsea/obj/azure_spear.c)
       Creator: Arman
       A spear crafted by elves during the Kinslayer War, it was heavily enchanted as
       a bane to humans, its pen being increased significantly against them.
       Wielded by a sea-elf prince (~bloodsea/living/sea_elf_prince), one needs good
       swimming skill to reach him, and probably be able to kill him quickly enough
       so that they do not drown.
       Two handed
       Hit:  45 (45 vs humans)
       Pen:  40 (55 vs humans)
       Limited to 9 in the game.

     darkened leather whip (~bloodsea/obj/whip.c)
       Creator: Arman
       A whip that has been enhanced through dark ogre rituals.  It is very easy to 
       hit creatures with it, however its pen value depends on the wielders race,
       alignment, and strength.

       Hit: 50
       Pen: 6 to 50 (str/8 for good aligned; str/4 for evil goblinoid; str/6 for
                     other evils)
       Limit of 7 per game.

    blunted long-handled axe (~bloodsea/obj/chemosh_axe.c)
       Creator: Arman

       This axe is embued with the unholy blessings of Chemosh, Lord of Death. 
       It has the power to draw the souls from the newly eparted when commanded 
       to (up to 10), empowering its hit and pen in the process and making 
       the wielder deceptively quick with the big weapon. 
       With enough slain souls captured within it, the wielder may 'feed' upon 
       the souls, healing themselves 2000 hp, however this results in a drop of
       alignment each time by 100 and will reduce the souls stored by 3 (the max
       number of souls that can be stored is 10).

       Only someone of evil alignment (-300 or less) may use the feed and draw 
       souls abilities.  The speed bonus is 75, and is for anyone who wields the
       axe. This is a two handed axe, of which there can be around 4 per armageddon.

       Hit : 15 (4 souls raises to 35; 6 souls 45; 8 souls+ 50)
       Pen : 15 (4 souls raises to 45; 6 souls 55; 8 souls+ 60)
