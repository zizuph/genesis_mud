Guild         : Kender of Ansalon
Type          : Occupational
Style         : Thief
Alignment     : Neutral - Good

=======
Purpose
=======
The opening of the kender race guild was very exciting. Several
people rushed to become one of these mischievous folk, but were
soon to find out that they weren't welcome in many places. Their
occupational guild choices: Gladiator (Interesting for a few days,
but no kender would remain a slave after they became bored.),
Kahedan (Hmmm, a serious kender??), Calian (Finally, a guild that
they can fit into, but it still didn't give them the abilities
they needed to fully play a kender). I thought it
was time to create a guild which gave kender a definite place to
belong to that allowed them to be themselves: carefree, mischief-
making handlers. They would be trained in combat (but not focus
their lives on it) in a way suitable to the acrobatic kender,
stealthiness, lock-picking and things typically learned by widely
travelled people.

=======
General
=======

- Those kender who became evil would be thrown out. 
- No thieves allowed. Kender who became thieves after
  joining would be thrown out.
- Must complete a quest, and be voted in.
- A majority vote (2/3 of all voting?) can expel a kender
  from the guild. Being kicked out would result in being
  banished from the guild until a successful vote to unbanish
  them. 
- Voting: A kender can call a vote to do one of six things to
  any existing character -- banish someone from joining the 
  guild, remove a banishment from someone, expel (and banish)
  someone from the guild, declare someone an enemy of the
  guild (and expel/banish them if needed), pardon someone as
  an enemy of the guild (but not remove the banishment), and
  invite someone to join the guild. A person can also request
  an invitation, in which case, the vote will be called
  automatically. An enemy cannot be unbanished until they are 
  pardoned. An enemy of the guild will be further developed, 
  possibly to include the kender npcs of Kendermore giving them 
  a hard time, attacking stealing more, being refused shop 
  services, etc.
- Sorting rack/Equipment tallies: A kender can "sort <item(s)>" 
  from their accessible inventory. Those that recover will be
  placed into the rack. Those that don't will stay in the inventory.
  Each item that is placed into the rack will count towards a
  tally (skill). Taking it out will lower the tally skill. At
  armageddon, the tally will be 3/4 of the non-armageddon tally
  to encourage saving of the rack. Also, people without a tally
  enough to take items out at Armageddon will be able to take
  things out.
- Acquiring: A kender will not be able to resist the desire to
  borrow things. At a random time, they will borrow something
  from the people around them, or peek into their inventory.
- Guru quest option: Option to make a guru quest for sneak or
  hide in the future.
