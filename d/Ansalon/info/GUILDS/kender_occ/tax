Total Skills: 580                  480     540      

Formula is : (((max level - max adventurer guild level)
                * modifier) /60) = tax level
Skill Tax  : 480 / 60 = 8.0

Special Combat Abilities:
=========================
-- Taunt:

   Hitting someone with 100 defence with a weapon hit of 40 has about a 37%
   chance to hit. A person with a 40 hit weapon trying to hit someone with
   90 defence has a 40% chance, giving 3% combat aid per 10 levels of defence.

   Assuming average stats and special skill of 100, versus enemy of the
   same, we get a max of 33% lowered defence. We'll go by the standard
   tax for skills. If the target has 100 defence, lowered to 67 defence,
   a drop of 33 skill levels. At 3% combat aid per 10 levels, we get 9.9%
   combat aid total. At 1% tax for every 6% combat aid, we come to 1.65%

-- Dodge:

   Assuming average stats and special skill of 100, versus enemy of the
   same, we have: resolve_task(500 + 200 - hoopak bonus(50), ({average of 
   (special skill(100) and guild stat(100)), average of (wis(100) and 
   dex(100))}), enemy ({dex(100), (average of int(100) and wis(100))})).
   The lowest possible result for this is -99.85, and the highest is 53.69.
   A kender fails to dodge the blow if the result is negative. This comes
   out to a 35% chance of dodging. The special lasts for 30 seconds and
   resets for 8 seconds, allowing a kender to be dodging 79% of the time:
   79% of 35% the time is: 27.684% of the time. 

   For every 6% of combat aid, 1% tax has to be charged: 27.684%/6 = 4.614%

-- Sling:

   Sling can be used once every 11 seconds. The pen is based on a resolved
   routine task using the dexterity and occupational stats of the slinger.
   The task result is added to the polearm skill(80 max) and the combat
   tactics special skill(100 max).

   If we take a player of 100 stat average, 80 polearm skill, and 100
   special skill, we get a max task result of 140. The result is
   added to the skills, which gives 320.

   We compare that to a normal attack of F_PENMOD(40, 100) = 280, and
   multiplied by .45 as it can be used once every 11 seconds.

   Combat aid = (.45 * 320/280) = 51.423%
   This is reduced by 11% based on 105 to_hit. 11% of 51.423 = 5.657%
   51.423 - 5.657 = 45.766%
   Combat aid is taxed 1% for every 6% of combat aid: 45.766/6 = 7.628%

-- N.B. Dodge and sling can be treated as one special of combat tactics,
   since sling can't be used when taking any hits or when dodging or dodge
   is resetting, and dodge can't be used while slinging or sling is resetting.
   The highest taxed one should be counted only, which is sling at 4.286%.

Miscellaneous Specials Abilities that don't necessarily need tax but may:
========================================================================

-- Borrow/Acquire:
   Uses the thief steal code, just with a different command. 
   Every once in a while, a kender will be forced to borrow
   something from someone beside them, or peek in their inventory.
   No tax, mudlib skill.

-- Quiet:
   Autosneak (not taxed in thieves guild)

-- Wander:
   The ability to wander out of a room without the bystanders noticing which
   direction you went. Check on sneak skill which is taxed already. No tax.
 
-- No Fear:
   NPC_I_NO_FEAR prop set (With Mercade's permission). Enables kender to attack
   anything. As far as the advantages of being able to attack things that you
   probably can't do more than tickle, there aren't many. This is mainly meant
   to go along with the idea that kender are immune to fear.
   I'll assign a small tax of 0.2%. However, going along with the theme of
   no fear, dodge is almost incapacitated with a wimpy above terribly hurt.
   I think that nicely balances out the no fear tax to 0.

-- Sorting rack:
   A kender can "sort <item(s)>" from their accessible inventory. Those that
   recover will be placed into the rack. Those that don't will stay in the
   inventory. Also, an equipment point system is in place to keep equipment
   looting down. No tax, as it's just a time saving device so players can
   get more pleasure out of the game in the time they have.

-- Titles:
   Kender start with no visible title. They can then set it to their normal
   guild title, change it to a title from a set list, or change it back to
   being hidden. No tax.

-- Collect pebbles:
   Allows a kender to collect up to 9 pebbles in each outdoor room. Pebbles
   are necessary for the sling special. No tax.

-- Guru quest:
   Allows for the possibility of a guru quest for sneak or hide.
