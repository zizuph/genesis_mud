                * modifier) /60) = tax level
Skill Tax  : 480 / 60 = 8.0
 
Special Combat Abilities:
=========================
-- Taunt:
   Because combat skills are valued at 1% tax per 40 levels of skill,
   and because 1% tax translates into 6% combat aid, every level of
   a combat skill is worth 0.15% combat aid.  Since 3 skills are
   lowered by a maximum of 33 levels each, combat aid works out to
   33 * 0.15 * 3, or 14.85% combat aid.  The special takes 5 seconds
   to prepare, then works for 90 seconds, or 94.74% of the time.
   This lowers combat aid to 14.0685%.  Tax = 14.0685/6, or 2.345%.

-- Dodge:
 
   Assuming average stats and special skill of 100, versus enemy of the
   same, we have: resolve_task(500 + burdened percentage(0-100) - 
   hoopak bonus(50), ({average of (dodge skill(100) and guild stat(100)), 
   dex(100)}), enemy ({dex(100), (average of int(100) and wis(100))})). 
   According to man tasks, this winds up being a 49.9% chance of dodging. 
   The special lasts for 30 seconds and resets for 8 seconds, allowing a 
   kender to be dodging 78.94% of the time: 78.94% of 49.9% the time is: 
   39.39% of the time.
 
   For every 6% of combat aid, 1% tax has to be charged: 39.39%/6 = 6.565%

-- Sling:
   With the usual assumed maximums (40/40 weps, 100 stats and guildstat, etc.): 
   weaponstat = ((hit + pen)/2) * 1.25
             (40 + 40)/2  * 1.25
                  (50)
   stats = ((dex * 2) + guildstat)/8;
        ((100 * 2) + 100)/8
             (43.75)
   total = (weaponstat + stats)/2
             (93.75 / 2)
               (43.75)
   hitres = F_PENMOD(total, guild_skill_level);
         F_PENMOD(44, 100) = 302.
 
   Since kender are limited to 80 weapon skill, their normal F_PENMOD is
   (40, 80) = 250.  302/250 = 1.208.  Because the special causes 3 seconds
   where the slinger is effectively stunned and can't fight while preparing,
   and the cycle runs prepare(3 seconds), sling(11 seconds), for a 14-second
   total, they are 100% disabled for 21.4% of the time the special's in use.
   Or, to put it another way, they are getting 78.6% of 1.208 so far (.95).
   Frequency is every 14 seconds, or 35.7% of the time.  And .95 * .357
   gives us 33.9% combat aid.  33.9/6 makes our tax rate 5.66 percent
   (rounding up).

-- N.B. Dodge and sling can be treated as one special of combat tactics,
   since sling can't be used when taking any hits or when dodging or dodge
   is resetting, and dodge can't be used while slinging or sling is resetting.
   The highest taxed one should be counted only, which is dodge at 6.56%

Miscellaneous Specials Abilities that don't necessarily need tax but may:
========================================================================
 
-- Borrow:
   Uses the thief steal code, just with a different command.
   Every once in a while, a kender will be forced to borrow
   something from someone beside them, or peek in their inventory.
   No tax, mudlib skill.
 
-- Tiptoe:
   Autosneak (not taxed in thieves guild)
 
-- Wander:
   The ability to wander out of a room without the bystanders noticing which
   direction you went. Check on sneak skill which is taxed already. No tax.
 
-- No Fear:
   NPC_I_NO_FEAR prop set (With Mercade's permission). Enables kender to attack   
   anything. As far as the advantages of being able to attack things that you
   probably can't do more than tickle, there aren't many. This is mainly meant
   to go along with the idea that kender are immune to fear.
   I'll assign a small tax of 0.2%. However, going along with the theme of
   no fear, dodge is almost incapacitated with a scaled wimpy according to
   size from hurt for very tiny newbies to death's door for the largest.
   I think that nicely balances out the no fear tax to 0.
 
-- Sorting rack:
   A kender can "sort <item(s)>" from their accessible inventory. Those that
   recover will be placed into the rack. Those that don't will stay in the
   inventory. Also, an equipment point system is in place to keep equipment
   looting down. No tax, as it's just a time saving device so players can
   get more pleasure out of the game in the time they have.
 
-- Titles:
   Kender start with no visible title. They can then set it to their normal
   guild title, change it to a title from a set list, or change it back to
   being hidden. No tax.
 
-- Collect pebbles:
   Allows a kender to collect up to 9 pebbles in each outdoor room. Pebbles
   are necessary for the sling special. No tax.
 
-- Guru quest:
   Allows for the possibility of a guru quest for sneak or hide, which
   would add 0.166% tax.
 
-- Faerie messengers:
   Faerie messengers that can be called like Ranger pigeons. The Ranger
   whistle spell is charged 0.1% tax, but faeries are more convenient to
   use, being able to go inside. tax 0.2%

-- Alter ability:
   Kender can alter polearms into hoopaks. However, many weapon specials 
   are lost this way, and the hoopak is often less in hit/pen when altered.
   The availability of hoopaks is very low, and kender must use hoopaks
   for sling, so we'll give this a 0.2% tax.
