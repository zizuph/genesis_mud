Theme for the Priests of Takhisis
=================================

The guild is based on the Dragonlance mythos, and is formed
as a priesthood serving the Queen of Darkness, Takhisis.

Leadership
----------

The guild is stricly hierarchical, and is divided into
three levels, designated Initiate, Priest and High Priest.
Each level has five sublevels, to distinguish rank.

The guild is ruled by the Nightlord, which is the person
who has chosen to assume that title. The leader rules
on the sufferance of the Queen herself, and the leader
will be deposed if he/she...
1) resigns from the position
2) is killed by another guildmember (political assassination)
3) is absent from his/her duties for more than a (RL) fortnight
4) is deposed by the High Priest Council (see below)

In each case, the previous leader is unable to attempt to gain
the position of leadership for 5 (RL) days.

Working under the leader is the High Priest Council (HPC), which
consists of 5 High Priests. The HPC members are nominated by
the leader, and the leader may also demote any member from the HPC.


The leader can...
1) assign and demote members to/from the HPC
2) reprimand any guild member, including punishment of
   guild status dropping
3) reward any guild member, including reward of guild
   status increase

The HPC can with a simple majority... (highest voting result)
1) together with the leader temporarily banish any guild member
2) together with the leader force a guild member to leave the guild

The HPC can with a absolute majority... (at least 4 positive votes)
1) depose a guild leader


The leader is the one responsible for forming guild policies.
Disobeying the leader is a punishable offence.
Note: No member is required to obey a superior, though it is
the superiors full right to discipline the lesser member if
not obeyed. The punishment of the leader shall only be used
in cases where the guild rules, or the guild policies are
not followed. (Guild rules are builtin, guild policies are
formed by the leader.)


Leaving and Joining
-------------------

Leaving the guilds lead to the loss of "up to the equivalent of
death", in most cases 1/4 of the combat exp, aswell as any special
skills trained in the guild (none at the moment)
When a guildmember is forced to leave, the punishment may vary,
max 1/3 of the combat exp.

Joining the guild requires the approval of two members of Priest
or higher level. One of these will recommend the prospective member,
the other will perform the actual initiation ritual.
To join one must be evil (<0 in align), not a member of any
occupational guild (naturally) and at least wanderer level.
