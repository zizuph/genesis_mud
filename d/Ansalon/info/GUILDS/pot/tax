Special: Soul gems.
A priest has the ability to use soul gems to reduce mana usage of spells.
The gem must be created by a High Priest with the spell pGem, then it can
be used by any member. To charge the gem, it must be wielded when killing
a foe. At the moment of death, the soul is trapped in the gem and charges
it with enemy->query_average_stat() CU (charge units). A gem has typically
a maximum storage capability of 300 CU, though it varies from gem to gem.

A charged gem can be inserted into the spell object, the medallion,
and it will then automatically discharge itself upon a successful spell
cast, replacing 1/6 of the mana used for the spell with as many
discharged CU's.

This will effectively reduce mana usage for the priest by 1/6th as
long as he has charged soul gems.

To calculate the tax for this ability, I started by counting it as combat
aid, for in a way, it can be said to be. 1/6th combat aid would be taxed
at 2,78%. Disadvantage for this is that the gem must be recharged, and
for it to be recharged it must be wielded, therefore it precludes the use
of two hand weapons and weapon / shield combo.
For this reason, I round the tax downwards, to 2%


Finally, I add a 3% room for extra add-ons, tax recalculations and such.


Additional taxes:

* Soul gem ability                2
* Reserved for future use         3
