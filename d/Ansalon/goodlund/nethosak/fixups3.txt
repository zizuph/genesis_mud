~forest/std/o_room_base	-following text messages should be fixed up for tod_descr:
				case MIDNIGHT - It's should be 'It is'
				case NIGHT - 'casts dark shadows' rather than 'draws dark..'
				cast AFTERNOON - doesn't make sense if it is winter. You 
				wouldn't feel the heat.
			

~forest/room/forest1	-the long description needs a bit of fixing up.  '..Through the 
			three trunks you notice...'  Shouldn't three be tree?
			-following add_items are missing: (tree trunks, trunks), (sea)
			-the description of the forest needs a space between 'forest'
			and 'floor' (you spelt it forestfloor)

~forest/room/forest2	-needs add_item (tree trunks, trunks) and (pier, Nethosak pier)
			-the description of the forest needs a space between 'forest'
			and 'floor' (you spelt it forestfloor). Looks like all outdoor rooms
			have this problem.. 

~forest/room/forest3	-You could probably change the add_item for underbrush to show 
			you can go northeast.
			-the description of the forest needs a space between 'forest'
			and 'floor' (you spelt it forestfloor). You may also want to add 
			in this description that you can make your way through the 
			underbrush to the northeast.

~forest/room/forest4, forest5, forest6	- It would probably be a good idea to show somewhere
					(either the long description or in an add item)
					directions of where you can go through the underbrush.

~forest/room/forest7	- As above with the hidden exit.
			-There should be an add_item for 'clearing'
			-in the long description, there should be no s at the end of 'blocks'
			-in the add item for 'peaks' there should be no , after isle
			-in the add item for 'peaks', you have an extra space after 'mountain peaks '
			so it doesn't allow you to examine mountain peaks.

~forest/room/forest9	-no add_item for clouds

~forest/room/forest20	-no add_item for tall oak trees
			-As with forest4,5,6 with hidden exits.

~forest/room/forest21	- this room isn't on the map
			-Long description says the path stretches away in many directions, but
			you can only go in one.  

~forest/room/forest22	-this is a gloomy part of the forest.. you may want to change the 
			add item to reflect this.
			-in long description, no , after thin mist of rain.
			-needs an add_item for (mist of rain, mist, rain, thin mist)
			
~forest/room/forest23, forest 25	-as above

~forest/room/forest24	- Its still too hard to find the hut.  Have an add_item for 'shadows'
			Saying 'The shadows of the forest could contain anything. It could do
			with a thorough search.'  That way at least the players have a clue
			that the hut is around here.
			-as above about the gloomy forest.

~forest/npc/boar	-Why on earth is its file name 'boar' when it is a wolf?
			-Its stats are way too high.  Drop all of them by around 50.
			-You may also want to make it that you can cut wolf skins from
			them, and that you can sell them for a decent price in Mithas.
			-Do a cbs on them.. they have a wierd bug with their hit areas.
			I think it is because you haven't made the %hit and %use add up
			to 100%

~forest/room/hut	-No , after hut in the first line of the long description.

~forest/npc/deer	-As with wolf (er boar) the stats are too high, and there is a bug
			with the %hit and %use. Plz fix.
			-As with wolf, you may want to make it you can cut off antlers and
			sell them.

~forest/room/forest19	-The add_item 'mountain peaks' needs to be fixed up as above.

~forest/npc/fox		-As with deer and wolf, too high stats, %hit and %use bug.

~forest/room/forest15	-No add_item for clearing.
			-The add_item 'mounain peaks' needs to be fixed up as above.

~forest/room/forest14	-No add_item for clouds

~forest/room/forest11	-In long description, need a space before Thin sun
			-Some hint that there is an exit east would be good.

~forest/room/forest12	-In long description, it says that the path leads in a number of
			directions.. there is only one exit out to the west.
