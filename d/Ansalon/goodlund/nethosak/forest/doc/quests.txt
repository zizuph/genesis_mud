Seeker Quest.
---------------

This quest takes place in the forest Mithas. The local
witch there (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/npc/laran.c)
needs someone to avenge the murder of her friend.
After searching the forest, the player might discover
a small circle of stones, that might have been a building
at some time. When moving some thin rocks that cover the
entrance downwards, the player will find himself unable
to move downwards because of a locked iron gate. When
asking the witch about this, she says that she has lost
the key to that place years ago. The player can go to
a stream in the forest (~nethosak/forest/room/forest28)
where the player can 'catch fish' to try and catch a fish
with his bare hands, if lucky enough he'll catch a trout
and after gutting it he'll discover a key inside it's stomac
They player can now enter the cellar of the room, where
he'll meet a beholder (/d/Ansalon/goodlund/nethosak/forest/
npc/beholder.c). This creature is very tough, and
casts spells like blindness, confusion and magic
missile. After the beholder has died, the player
can cut the key (and an eye) of the corpse (cuz
the beholder has eaten the key :) )
and he can now enter a hole in the wall, which will take
him to the treasure room, where he finds the Seeker, a
polearm that can be used as an axe or club, in a chest. 
When the player has returned the polearm to Dawn, he'll be 
rewarded with the magnificent amount of 5000 xp
and he'll get the weapon as a gift.

Troll Quest.
---------------
This is the second quest in the Forest of Mithas, handed out
by a witch there (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/npc/laran.c).
The player will be asked to slay a troll that has been
murdering deers and other creatures in the forest. The troll
will be placed in a random room in the forest, and after a
search he'll find it. The troll is very tough! And hunts if
the player runs away. If the player gets the killing blow on
the troll, it'll leave a artifact in it's corpse. (~/goodlund/
nethosak/forest/obj/armour/protector.c) and the player will get
3500 xp in reward. If he doesn't get the killing blow, the xp
is changed to only 1500 xp and the troll doesn't leave the
artifact.
