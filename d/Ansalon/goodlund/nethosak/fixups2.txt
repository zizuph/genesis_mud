We'll have to talk about where the boats will be going to.. some places,
like Kalad, are classed as closed, so no boats will be going there.  We 
may be able to get one to go to Grey Havens though, or Pelargir.

~nethosak/city/room/pier1	add_items needed
				-'horned bay', 'bay', 'blood sea',
				-'pier', 'wooden pier', 'small wooden pier'
				-'mithas', 'isle', 'village', 'nethosak'
				make it so that you can 'read sign' (add_cmd_item)

~nethosak/city/room/pier2	long description -
				"another pier.A cool wind.." should be a space after
				the period.
				Needs the same add items as above added.
				Make it so that you can 'read sign'

~nethosak/city/room/pier3	same corrections - re:pier2
				additional add items:
				-'peaks', 'volcanoes', 'volcanic peaks', 'four peaks'
				-'four volcanic peaks', 'grassy plains', 'plains',
				-'forest'

~nethosak/city/room/pier4	add items:
				-beach, forest, nethosak, village, small pier. 

				add_item footprints "You recognize the "+    
                         	"footprints as the prints of minotaurs, they "+
                         	"actually cover the entire trail." Full stop after
				minotuars. Capitalise They.

				"into a forest.A cool wind" needs a space after the period.

~nethosak/city/room/pier5	long description  "reminding you that winter is not far away. ."
				The end of the description has an extra space and period.

				add_items need to be fixed up re: pier4
				as well as 'warehouse'
				
~nethosak/city/room/warehouse	add items for:
				-crates, trunks, mouse, rat.

				In floor description and search floor, there should be consistency
				in how you write them.. either floor boards, or floorboards, not both.
				Also, the add item for floor needs a \n at the end.

				In the search function, perhaps mention that you would be able to go down
				through some loose floor boards, rather than say you can move floor boards,
				which you can't do (no cmd for it).  Also, when the person goes down through
				the floor, you should have a message for both the person who goes down (saying
				they climbed down under the warehouse) as well as a message for those who see
				them leave/arrive.   Have a look at the room in Flotsam where you can climb a 
				drainpipe in the alley for an example of what you can do.

~nethosak/city/room/sea1	In the no_go() function,  "to dangerous to swim" should be _too_ dangerous to swim,
				and "The current is far to strong" should be far _too_ strong

				add add_items... can't examine anything here.

~nethosak/city/room/pier6	Corrections as pier5
				add_item 'ship', 'huge ship', 'deck', 'hull', 'stormseeker'
				in the long description,  "The ship has a the name 'Stormseeker' writting on the"
				should be "The ship has the name 'Stormseeker' written on the"
