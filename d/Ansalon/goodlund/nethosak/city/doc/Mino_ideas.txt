Idea's for Minotaur Guild in Mithas.
-------------------------------------

- Race guild (perhaps Occ or race aswell, or both!).
- Minotaurs use three primary weapons: Sword, Axe and Club.
  Therefore the ability to choose between those.
- A minor quest must be solved in order to be changed into
  a minotaur. Perhaps you have to be invited to join the
  guild first.
- A special called Gore or Headbutt. Minotaurs are also know
  to bite people in combat, perhaps some sort of random
  special here...
- Because of their high strength, the minotaurs should
  have the ability to wield two-handed in one hand. The 
  downside of this is that ones parry will be reduced by
  some levels (It's a bit hard to parry blows with a huge
  two-handed sword).
- Use the arena that they have to something. It might only
  be possible to rise to a certain title, after that you
  have to prove your worth in the arena.
- After one has reached max title, he can choose to become
  a minotaur priest or continue to be a fighter....(perhaps
  a minotaur layman guild).
- Tough skin (add some natural ac because of their tough
  skin).
- Minotaurs can't wear helmet or boots.
- The chance to choose a specific clan, like the one
  Kaz was a member of.


 ...Just a few ideas...
