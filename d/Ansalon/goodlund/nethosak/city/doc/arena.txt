The arena in Mithas will be an option for characters
who wish to test their wits against each other, or
for characters who wish to duel to the death or just
beat each other senseless. Random factors will change
the results of each duel. The random factors being
such things as lava bursts burning the characters,
slipping on the rocky path, having to climb over
boulders to get anywhere, limited safe haven with
a key that drops out of the player's inventory from
time to time without notice. Optional blocking of
spells, herbs, potions, etc. No equipment will be
brought into the arena. All will be bought at the
door, with the choice of 4 different kinds of each
type of armour (light/low armour versus heavy/good
armour), and the choice of one or two handed sword,
mace, polearm, hoopak, or one-handed knife. All
items in the arena will be throwable, damage based
on weight, hit chance based on the missile skill
(Does that still exist in any trainable place?).
There will be items lying around the arena, such
as rocks, etc.
