Enchantments:
-------------

Note: Enchantments can be attached to any type of object, as long as they
      are non-magical. However, individual enchantments may have other
      requirements on what manner of object it is attached to.

    Dark Touch (~neraka/obj/darktouch.c)
        Creator : Ashlar
            This enchantment works on slashing and impaling weapons. On
            impact, the weapon spreads the dark touch, doing damage
            to all but undeads and the most evil creatures.
            However, the more good the creature is, the more damage it
            does, spreading corruption and evil in the wound.
            A weapon enchanted thus cannot be wielded by creatures above
            400 in alignment.

    Trueblade (~neraka/obj/trueblade.c)
        Creator : Ashlar
            This enchantment works on all types of weapons. It raises
            the to_hit of the weapon by 1-20 units, depending on the
            success of the enchanting.
