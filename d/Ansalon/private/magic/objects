 black-gem ring (~flotsam_forest/obj/armour/ring1.c)
       Creator : Arman

          This is a silver banded ring with a small black
          gem adorning it. Carved along
          the band is the spidery language of the Magi. It
          was enchanted long ago by wizards now long forgotten
          with the ability to suck the light from the wearers
          surroundings when worn, effectively a -1 light. This is 
          negated when the ring is removed.
          It is occasionally found in the dragons lair, and there are
          only 3 ever in the game.

  shiny/dull wand (~flotsam_forest/obj/wand.c)

        Creator : Arman

          This wand is a wand of teleportation. It is designed
          to teleport players to a certain point in the
          domain of Ansalon. It has one charge, but can be
          recharged if the player has a spellcraft skill of
          40 + and knows the proper chant to recharge it.
          Recharging it drains the player of 100-150 mana.

          It is found at the start of the minotaur maze.
          Another is also found in the Flotsam area.

   blue-tinged crystal (~kalaman/obj/scry_crystal.c)

         Creator : Arman

           This crystal has an enchantment on it allowing the holder
           to scry on any other player in the game. The number of times a
           crystal may be used depends highly on ones spellcraft and divination
           skills (spellcraft + divination skills have to be greater than
           random 200, otherwise the crystal shatters after a use.
           This object may only be found after the completion
           of the Kalaman Merchant Quest.

     foul_smelling liquid (~estwilde/obj/dwarf_potion.c)
          Creator : Arman

          This potion increases ones resistance to poison when
          quaffed, the potent brew slowing down the effect
          of poisons by a certain amount depending on ones
          race.
          The effect alters ones _magic_i_res_poison prop
          for 10-12 minutes. The level of effect on each race:
          dwarf - 20%
          hobbit/gnome/goblin - 10%
          human - 5%
          This brew is too potent for elves. It makes them sick,
            literally emptying their stomach.
          This potion can be bought in Iron Delving after
          doing a small quest for the local brewer (have to
          do the quest each time to buy from him). One can
          buy a maximun of 3 of these potions per armageddon.
          The effects of this potion are not additive.
          This potion when quaffed also sets ones intox level
          to the players maximum level, due to its potency.
          Can be found in the tomb of the dwarven guru quest guy, and
          in a chest within a cave network between Neraka and Sanction.

    Medallion of the Istarian Merchant (~kalaman/obj/merc_medallion)
          Creator : Arman

          This medallion is a quest object that needs to be returned in
           the Kalaman Merchant Quest. When worn, it gives
           the wearer an increase in the skills SS_TRADING,
           SS_APPR_OBJ and SS_APPR_VAL (10,20,20 respectively).

    Slimy eye (~goodlund/nethosak/forest/obj/beholder_eye)
          Creator : Elmore

          This eye comes from a beholder in the forest of Mithas.
          The player can cut out this eye and hold it, giving him or
          her 25 in magic resistance.

    midnight-black orb (~balifor/flotsam_forest/obj/black_orb)
          Creator : Arman
          
          This magic orb is an artifact of the dark god of magic,
          Nuitari.  When held by a player with spellcraft skill greater
          than 80 and alignment less than -200, the orb has the property
          OBJ_I_LIGHT set to -1.  If held by a player of alignment greater
          than 500 there is no beneficial affect, although the weight of the
          orb increases by a factor of 100 (from 235 to 23,500).
          
    silver braided circlet (~kalaman/obj/armour/circlet)
          Creator : Arman

          This circlet was once owned by an elven archer-mage who enchanted
          the circlet to enhance his hunting skills. The wearer of this circlet
          has enhanced perceptions (+10 awareness) and missile skills (+10).
          If the black diamond that sits in the center of the circlet is removed,
          the enchantment is lost.  The circlet is worn on the head, offering
          5 AC protection.

    sea-green potion (~goodlund/bloodsea/obj/swim_potion.c)
          Creator : Arman? Navarre?

          This potion has been brewed by the sea-elves. It is used to provide 
          their friends living on land a way to visit them in their home.

          Can also be made by alchemists with a mortar and vial with some
          water and the heart of a sea lion.
          (/d/Krynn/south_courrain/obj/sealion_heart.c)
          (/d/Krynn/south_courrain/living/sealion.c)

          When quaffed it provides +40 swim skill, with the effect lasting
          20 minutes.


    ethereal vessel (~estwilde/iron_delving/obj/brewcraft_beervessel_rare0.c)
          Creator: Vitwitch

          ***teleportation object -- between preset fixed locations

          This is a regular crystal brew vessel that has been changed by
          a lightning strike.  Regular brew vessels transit between Worlds
          (from ancient Sumer to Krynn) carrying only brew.  As a result of
          the lightning strike, this vessel has no brew, but will now
          teleport its owner and teammates between Realms.

          The teleport locations are restricted to GSL and non-GSL
          shipping piers. Teleportation only occurs along the existing
          shipping routes. Some piers are excluded from service to
          respect club/guild restrictions.

          There is a 1% chance of this object vanishing after each use --
          giving an average of 50 uses before it is gone.

          This object recovers. It cannot be put, sold nor given. It has
          no mana cost nor spellcraft requirement. It is a ~50-use
          'prepaid' divine conjuration object -- the product of the
          Sumerian god Neti and a freak lightning strike.

          It occurs at a rate of 1% of all regular brew vessels served in
          the barrelhole (~estwilde/iron_delving/brewery5.c). Note that players
          cannot hold multiple brew vessels, they must drink what they get
          before they can get another. So limits on alcohol consumption
          apply to how often it is encountered.

    blistered vessel (~estwilde/iron_delving/obj/brewcraft_beervessel_rare1.c)
          Creator: Vitwitch

          ***area effect intoxication object 

          This is a regular crystal brew vessel that has been changed by
          a lightning strike.  Regular brew vessels transit between worlds
          (from ancient Sumer to Krynn) carrying only brew. As a result of
          the lightning strike, this vessel has its brew trapped within a
          large crystal blister -- making it not directly drinkable.

          To get the effect of the alcohol within, it must be shattered. 
          When it is shattered, it is destroyed, but causes all players
          in the room to be extremely obliviated by a divine shockwave. 

          This object recovers. It cannot be put, sold nor given. It has
          no mana cost nor spellcraft requirement. It is a one-use
          'prepaid' divine conjuration object -- the product of the
          Sumerian god Ninkasi and a freak lightning strike.

          (Shadow Union guild members are protected by Jazur who 
           intercedes on their behalf. Dead and Un-dead are affected
           by the wave since they are not imbibing alcohol, they are
           being intoxiacted by the power of the goddess Ninkasi.)

          Since the liquid trigger inside the blister is still a 'drink'
          it can and will be destroyed by time spent in Raumdor.

          It occurs at a rate of 2% of all regular brew vessels served in
          the barrelhole (/d/Ansalon/estwilde/iron_delving/brewery5.c).
          Note that players cannot hold multiple brew vessels, they must
          drink what they get before they can get another. So limits on
          alcohol consumption apply to how often it is encountered.


    Robe of the Darkling Sea
    Robe of Zeboim
    Robe of Woven Worms (/d/Krynn/turbidus_ocean/obj/zebrobe.c)

          Creator: Vitwitch

          ***appearance_offset rest object

            INTENT:
             The purpose of this object is to counteract the permanent change
             made to appearance_offset by Sateela's Robe.
                (/d/Ansalon/goodlund/kendermore/obj/wrobe.c)
             Sateela's robe makes female wearers attractive while they wear the
             robe, but hideous forever after. This has caused some agst among
             female players. 

             This object offers a method to return to the default setting.

            LONG DESCRIPTION:
            "This 'robe' is a wearable mass of giant tubeworms. Perhaps they
             wove themselves together in the darkness of the ocean deeps and
             perished in one another's embrace. The robe is soaking wet and
             deep-ocean cold besides. It clings hideously to the touch. It
             possesses a curious aura of divine magicality."

            WHEN TRYING TO PUT or DROP:
            "Having picked it up, the robe of woven worms clings wetly to you.
             Wearing it or burning it should dry it out.

            WHEN WORN:
            "You slip on the robe of woven worms. It clings hideously to
             your body. In it you are as attractive as a rotten fish on a
             platter at your name-day banquet... ugh!"

            EFFECT: 
             While worn, it sets the player's appearance_offset to 50 -- enough
             to make someone appear hideous.

             If worn for an hour of game time, it will dry out and fall off.
             When this happens, it resets the player's appearance_offset to 0,
             no matter what it was before, which is the neutral setting.

             Twenty times over the course of the hour of game time, the robe
             will tell the room in which the player stands "Something hideous
             this way came..."
