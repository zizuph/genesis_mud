 plate armour of Solamnus (~flotsam_forest/obj/armour/vin_armour.c)
       Creator: Arman

          Of all the armours in Ansalon, this is by far the
          finest. It consists of a breastplate, shoulder guards
          and arm fittings, all made of the finest steel and
          beautifully tooled with the markings of the three
          Solamnic Orders. This armour was forged when the Knights
          of Solamnia were newly formed. Enchanted by the White
          Robed Wizards of High Sorcery, and blessed by the 
          High Priests of Paladine, it offers great protection.
          The wearers of such armours include the founder Vinas
          Solamnus, and the hero Huma Dragonsbane. It is thus
          greatly prized by knights and warriors alike.
          (ac: 50+random(9), at: TORSO, ARMS and LEGS
          (was 65 originally, then somehow got to be 80, and now
           fixed to valid number).
          It is an item that is to be found for a task of 
          Quest proportions, and thus its location shall not
          be specified here. Lets just say it is _very_ hard
          to get :-). Think of it like the Holy Grail. *grin*

            to move silently and hide more like an elven
            tracker. This armour offers a +5 bonus to hide and
            sneak. It weighs 10 kgs, and when worn offers a

     pair of gray leather boots (~flotsam_forest/obj/armour/mag_bootsc)
          Creator : Arman

          A pair of enchanted boots that will only fit
          the smaller races (except hobbits, they hate
          shoes). This set of boots raises the wearers
          dex by 10 while they are worn. If the wearers
          dex is epic or greater (136 +) the boot rejects
          the wearer in a fit of jealousy, not allowing
          the extremely agile to wear them.
          It is guarded by the river troll
          (~flotsam_forest/living/troll.c).

     intricately woven silvery thorns (~goodlund/kendermore/obj/thorns.c)
          Creator : Gwyneth

          This circlet of thorns was enchanted by a red robe mage.
          It drains 400-500 hit points upon wearing. Every 30
          seconds after wearing, it drains 100-200 hps, adds 30-50
          mana, and adds 20-30 panic. It can be found hidden in a secret
          panel in a statue in (~goodlund/kendermore/room/street33.c).
          When searched, it falls out, but is grabbed up by a kender
          who drops it in one of ten random rooms around Kendermore.
          Once gotten, the thorns cannot be given directly to anyone
          due to their sharp thorns.

     sparkly red mask (~gwyneth/private/entrance/obj/mask.c)
          Creator : Gwyneth

          This mask is given out by Merldon for the Kender entrance
          quest. It allows the wearer to see invisible. It cannot
          be dropped or given away to anyone but Merldon.

     flaming-red pelt (~Ansalon/dargaard/obj/armour/pelt.c)
          Creator : Elmore (altered by Arman)

          This cloak can be cut from the corpse of a hellhound - a 
          creature that is summoned by an undead knight that 
          infrequently leads assaults upon the Neidar Clan (see 
          ~dargaard/npc/hound.c).  This cloak offers greater than
          normal protection (ac 30, mod (-1,2,-1)), as well as 25%
          protection from fire.

     pair of knee-high brown boots (~taman_busuk/mountains/obj/boots.c)
          Creator : Stralle

          This is a pair of enchanted Nordmaarian walking boots. They
          increase the speed of the wearer (20) and increases the rate
          fatigue is restored.  They cover both the legs and feet (ac 30)
          Hobbits cannot wear them.
     
    steel spiked helm (~Ansalon/goodlund/kendermore/obj/merchelm.c)
        Creator : Navarre

        This helm is occassionally worn by the mercenary (Jaine).
        It will hurt anyone hitting the wearer on the head from the
        spikes with a hit_me(50+random(100)).
        The head is not targeted very often, and its even less hit.
        So this is not occuring very often.

    blackend leather champron (~Ansalon/goodlund/bloodsea/obj/blackened_champron.c)
        Creator: Navarre
 
        This head piece is worn by Minotaurs only. 
        It does not offer any protection, but it does offer dark vision of 1 level,
        paid by mana drain. 
        This armour corresponds to the black bandana on the sparkle-flotsam boat,
        that also gives 1 darkness levels, but that minotaurs cannot wear.
        Now they have another interesting head piece to go for.
