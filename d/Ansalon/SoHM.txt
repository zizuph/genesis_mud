School of High Magic
--------------------

BACKGROUND
This is the magic school in Solace that Raistlin attended prior to him
taking the Test to become a Wizard of High Sorcery. This is planned to 
be the precursor guild for the Wizard of High Sorcery.

This guild will offer both occupational and layman options, allowing players 
to become "dabblers" in the Art (like the elf Gilthanas).

According to the novels, the School of High Magic in Solace was called Poolbottom,
and was run by a Master Theobald.

Allowed races - Elves, drow, humans, gnomes, half-elves, hobgoblins(?)

LEVELS
There will be 12 levels for Students of High Magic (SoHM), based off guild stat:

ABILITIES
A SoHM (and WoHS) gains spell 'slots' as they increase in level. These slots are
quite limited (3 to 11), however a SoHM will be able to 'study' the spells they have 
collected and stored in their spellbook into a slot, allowing them to change the spells 
they have memorised depending on their spell requirements.

A spell memorised can be cast as often as the SoHMs mana allows.

How often a SoHM can 'study' and change their spell slots will depend on a special guild
skill, "Arcane Study".  At skill level 100 (superior guru) a SoHM can refresh their spell
slots every 12 hours. Every level below 100 increase the time a SoHM must wait to refresh
by one hour, so a SoHM with superior journeyman Arcane Study can switch spells approximately
every 2 and a half days (12 + 50 hours = 62 hours, or every 2 days 14 hours). Someone without
the skill will need to wait 4 days 16 hours to refresh their skill slots.

The key drawcard of being a SoHM/WoHS is flexibility to choose ones spell reportoire. 

Proposed spells
---------------
A handful of spells at level 0 and 1 will be learnable from the School premise for SoHM. However a number 
will need to be collected through adventuring around Ansalon/Krynn... sometimes through battling very 
challenging beasts/enemies.

Two cantrips learnable at the School will be required to learn new spells - 'read magic' to identify new spell 
scrolls; and 'write magic', which allows a scroll to be transcribed into the SoHMs spellbook.  

Those who graduate to a WoHS will be able to learn spells from the Tower of Wayreth up to level 3, with the
more powerful spells (level 4) being only collectable through adventuring.

================================================================================================================
Wizards of High Sorcery
================================================================================================================

The plan is that occupational SoHM will be able to take the Test to become a Wizard of High Sorcery
(WoHS) from level 9 (lowest apprentice level). At this point they will be able to access the Tower of
Wayreth south of Haven. SoHMs who attempt this at level 9 will find the Test challenging, while those
who attempt it at level 12 (Experienced apprentice) will find it somewhat easier.

The Test will involve several things: A test of a mage's knowledge  of magic, problems that 
demand the casting of key spells that an initiate knows, a test that cannot be solved by merely using magic, 
combat against someone that the initiate knows as an ally, and combat against someone or something 
considerably more powerful than the initiate. 

Failing the Test results in death.

Successfully completing the Test allows the SoHM becoming a WoHS, and also dictates what branch of the
WoHS they join - the White (good; alignment > 200) the Red (neutral; 1000 > alignment < -1000) or the 
Black (Evil; alignment < 200). 

The Test will essentially be the guild's guru quest.

WoHS will be occupational, with minimal restrictions on layman class selections. Dragonlance lore has a number
of characters who have been WoHS as well as other classes (e.g. Ariakas Red Dragon Highlord, warrior/WOHS; 
Feol-Thas White Dragon Highlord, WoHS/fighter; Par Sailen's replacement at the head of the WoHS white order was
a WoHS/mariner).

LEVELS
Occupational guildstat is reset upon becoming a WoHS, although not necessarily to zero.

Council titles: 
Guild leader - Grand Master of the Tower of Wayreth [chosen from one of the Order leaders]
Order leaders - Master/Mistress of the Order of the [colour] Robes

ABILITIES
Apart from slightly more skill levels in Arcane Study, and access to more spells,WoHS benefit from the phases 
of the Krynn moons.

There are three moons of magic - Solinari, the White Moon; Lunitari the Red Moon; and Nuitari the Black Moon 
(whose aspect only Black Robe wizards can see).

When a Wizard's moon is at High Sanction, they gain either increased effectiveness of spells, reduced mana cost 
of spells, or removal of component requirements for certain spells.  

Multiple moons at high sanction provide enhanced number of benefits - one moon at High Sanction one benefit; 
two moons two benefits etc.  Mind having all three moons at High Sanction is a rarity.

Proposed spells by form:

These are spells that it is proposed players can transcribe into their spellbook.
Those marked as * will be learnable at SoHM and WoHS guild premises.
Those marked as ** will be learnable at WoHS guild premise.

All spells will be "findable" their exploration. Level 4 spells will generally have
a challenging guardian one needs to defeat before being able to get hold of the spell.

There are a number of combat spells that will essentially do the same thing. The
difference is the form and element of the spell. This will allow players to focus on 
a form path without worrying too much about min/maxxing combat abilities.

HISTORY WIZARD OF HIGH SORCERY
Of all the orders of the world of Krynn, none are as old,  as feared, or as 
respected as the Orders of High Sorcery. They came into being almost at the 
beginning of the world;  their tale is that of the three Gods of Magic. The 
gods of magic, Solinari, Lunitari and Nuitari, walked the face of creation 
before the stars settled in their places. Though they had a common love of 
magic, each had aspects that differed greatly from those of the others.
 
Each also chose a different path in the universe. They saw the other gods 
wheeling through the heavens and aligning themselves against one another 
according to their goals and philosophies. The All-Saints War was coming, 
as their vision and foresight had warned. The three gods feared that they 
too must choose. Bound by the common bond of magic, these three looked 
about the face of Krynn and loved it greatly. Thus they did not join their 
fellow gods in the heavens, but stayed close to the world. They revolved 
about it, granting their powers to those who would follow their ways. Each
god was granted a time to walk the face of Krynn and seek out a follower. 

Each found an apprentice and to each did they give the keys to the Lost 
Citadel--a fabulous place of wizardry that stood beyond the circles of 
the universe itself. Here the gods taught them the Foundations of Wizardry.

 
1. All wizards are brothers in their order. All orders are brothers in 
   their power.
2. The places of High Wizardry are held in common among all orders and no
   sorcery is to be used there in anger against fellow wizards.
3. The world beyond the walls of the towers may brign brother against 
   brother and order against order, but such is the way of the universe.

The Orders of Sorcery began as loosely organized groups of wizards. It was
not until much later that the orders became formalized and structured. 
During the Age of Dreams at the onset of the First Dragonwar, the masters 
of each of the orders came together at the Lost Citadel and proclaimed the 
unity of the orders. The Lost Citadel was a wondrous place from whence the 
master wizards ruled their orders in peace and harmony, far removed from 
the world of Krynn. Both palace and fortress, it provided a place where 
the powers of magic dould be tempered by the wisdom of the Conclave of 
Wizards. 

It is important for any magic-user in Krynn to remember that a 
wizard's only loyalty is to magic. This is the primary reason that magic 
has remained in the world, desptie many efforts to eliminate it. A wizard 
of the Black Robes and a wizard of the White fighting on opposing sides of
a war (such as the War of the Lance) would not hesitate to destroy each 
other. When these wizards meet on neutral ground (such as a Tower of High 
Sorcery), they are likely to enter into an eager discussion of magic. If 
attacked by an outside force seen as a threat to their magic (a renegade 
wizard, for example), both would join together to fight in defense of the
magic.
