                      The Woman of Kemay
                   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     One of the things a wizard can do is turn into something else--
take another form. Shape-changing, they call it. An ordinary sorcerer
can make himself look like somebody else, or like an animal, just
so you don't know for a minute what you're seeing--as if he'd put
on a mask. But the wizards and mages can do more than that. They 
can be the mask, they can truly change into another being. So
a wizard, if he wanted to cross the sea and had no boat, might
turn himself into a gull and fly across. But he has to be
careful. If he stays a bird, he begins to think what a bird thinks
and forget what a man thinks, and he might fly off and be a gull 
and never a man again. So they say there was a great wizard once
who liked to turn himself into a bear, and did it too often, and
became a bear, and killed his own little son; and they had to hunt
him down and kill him. But Ogion used to joke about it, too. Once
when the mice got into his pantry and ruined the cheese, he caught
one with a tiny mousetrap spell, and he held the mouse up like
this and looked it in the eye and said, "I told you not to play
mouse!" And for a minute I thought he meant it...

     Well, this story is about something like shape-changing but
Ogion said it was beyond all shape-changing he knew, because it
was about being two things, two beings, at once, and in the same
form, and he said that this is beyond the power of wizards. But 
he met with it in a little village around the northwest coast
of Gont, a place called Kemay. There was a woman there, an old
fisherwoman, not a witch, not learned; but she made songs. That's
how Ogion came to hear of her. He was wandering there, the way he
did, going along the coast, listening; and he heard somebody
singing, mending a net or caulking a boat and singing as they
worked:

     Farther west than west
     beyond the land
     my people are dancing 
     on the other wind.

     It was the tune and the words both that Ogion heard, and he
had never heard them before, so he asked where the song came from.
And from one answer to another, he went along to where somebody
said, "Oh, that's one of the songs of the Woman of Kemay." So he
went on along to Kemay, the little fishing port where the woman
lived, and he found her house down by the harbor. And he knocked
on the door with his mage's staff. And she came and opened the 
door.

     Now you know, you remember when we talked about names, how
children have child-names, and everybody has a use-name, and
maybe a nickname too. Different people may call you differently.
You're my Therru, but maybe you'll have a Hardic use-name when
you get older. But also, when you come into your womanhood,
you will, if all be rightly done, be given your true name. It
will be given you by one of true power, a wizard or a mage,
because that is their power, their art--naming. And that's
the name you'll maybe never tell another person, because
your own self is in your true name. It is your strength, your
power; but to another it is risk and burden, only to be given
in utmost need and trust. But a great mage, knowing all names,
may know it without your telling him.

     So Ogion, who is a great mage, stood at the door of the
little house there by the seawall, and the old woman opened
the door. Then Ogion stepped back, and he held up his oak
staff, and put up his hand, too, like this, as if trying to
protect himself from the heat of a fire, and in his amazement
and fear he said her true name aloud--"Dragon!"

     In that first moment, he told me, it was no woman he
saw at all in the doorway, but a blaze and glory of fire,
and a glitter of gold scales and talons, and the great eyes
of a dragon. They say you must not look into a dragon's eyes.

    Then that was gone, and he saw no dragon, but an old
woman standing there in the doorway, a bit stooped, a tall
old fisherwoman with big hands. She looked at him as he did
at her. And she said, "Come in, Lord Ogion."

     So he went in. She served him fish soup, and they ate,
and then they talked by her fire. He thought that she must
be a shape-changer, but he didn't know, you see, whether
she was a woman who could change herself into a dragon, or
a dragon who could change itself into a woman. So he asked 
her at last, "Are you woman or dragon?" And she didn't say, 
but she said, "I'll sing you a story I know."

     So this is the story she sang to him, to Ogion.

     When Segoy raised the islands of the world from the sea
in the beginning of time, the dragons were the first born of
the land and the wind blowing over the land. So the Song of
Creation tells. But her song told also that then, in the
beginning, dragon and human were all one. They were all one
people, one race, winged, and speaking the True Language.

     They were beautiful, and strong, and wise, and free.

     But in time nothing can be without becoming. So among
the dragon-people some became more and more in love with
flight and wildness, and would have less and less to do with
the works of making, or with study and learning, or with houses
and cities. They wanted only to fly farther and farther, 
hunting and eating their kill, ignorant and uncaring, seeking
more freedom and more.

     Others of the dragon-people came to care little for 
flight, but gathered up treasure, wealth, things made, things
learned. They built houses, strongholds to keep their treasures
in, so they could pass all they gained to their children, ever
seeking more increase and more. And they came to fear the wild
ones, who might come flying and destroy all their dear hoard,
burn it up in a blast of flame out of mere carelessness and
ferocity.

     The wild ones feared nothing. They learned nothing. Because
they were ignorant and fearless, they could not save themselves
when the flightless ones trapped them as animals and killed them.
But other wild ones would come flying and set the beautiful houses
afire, and destroy, and kill. Those that were strongest, wild
or wise, were those who killed each other first.

     Those who were most afraid, they hid from the fighting, and
when there was no more hiding they ran from it. They used their
skills of making and made boats and sailed east, away from the
western isles where the great winged ones made war among the
ruined towers.

     So those who had been both dragon and human changed,
becoming two peoples--the dragons, always fewer and wilder,
scattered by the endless mindless greed and anger, in the
far islands of the Western Reach; and the human folk, 
always more numerous in the rich towns and cities, filling
up the Inner Isles and all the south and east. But among
them there were some who saved the learning of the dragons--
the True Language of the Making--and these are now the
wizards.

     But also, the song said, there are those among us who
know they were once dragons, and among the dragons there
are some who know their kinship with us. And these say that 
when the one people were becoming two, some of them, still
both human and dragon, still winged, went not east but west, 
on over the Open Sea, till they came to the other side of the
world. There they live in peace, great winged beings both
wild and wise, with human mind and dragon heart. And so she
sang,

     Farther west than west
     beyond the land
     my people are dancing 
     on the other wind.
     
     So that was the story told in the song of the Woman of Kemay,
and it ended with those words.

     Then Ogion said to her, "When I first saw you I saw your
true being. This woman who sits across the hearth from me
is no more than the dress she wears."

     But she shook her head and laughed, and all she would say
was, "If only it were that simple!"

     So then after a while Ogion came back to Re Albi. And
when he told me the story, he said to me, "Ever since that 
day, I have wondered if anyone, man or dragon, has been farther
west than west; and who we are, and where our wholeness lies..."
