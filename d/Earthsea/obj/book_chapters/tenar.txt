             -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Nothing grew at that far end of the Overfell but lichens 
and rockworts and here and there a blue daisy, wind-stunted, 
like a button dropped on the rough, crumbling stone. Inland of
the cliff's edge to the north and east, above a narrow strip 
of marshland the dark tremendous side of Gont Mountain rose up,
forested almost to the peak. The cliff stood so high above the
bay that one must look down to see its outer shores and the
vague lowlands of Essary. Beyond them, in all the south and
west, there was nothing but the sky above the sea.

     Tenar had liked to go there in the years she had lived 
in Re Albi. Ogion had loved the forests, but she, who had
lived in a desert where the only trees for a hundred miles
were a gnarled orchard of peach and apple, hand watered in
the endless summers, where nothing grew green and moist and
easy, where there was nothing but a mountain and a great
plain and the sky--she liked the cliff's edge better than
the enclosing woods. She liked having nothing at all over
her head.

     The lichens, the grey rockwort the stemless daisies,
she liked them too; they were familiar. She sat down on
the shelving rock a few feet from the edge and looked out
to sea as she had used to do. The sun was hot but the
ceaseless wind cooled the sweat on her face and arms. She
leaned back on her hands and thought of nothing, sun and
wind and sky and sea filling her, making her transparent
to sun, wind, sky, sea. But her left hand reminded her of
its existence, and she looked round to see what was scratching
the heal of her hand. It was a tiny thistle, crouched in a 
crack in the sandstone, barely lifting its colorless spikes
into the light and wind. It nodded stiffly as the wind blew,
resisting the wind, rooted in rock. She gazed at it for a long
time.

     When she looked out to sea again she saw, blue in the 
blue haze where sea met sky, the line of an island, 
Oranea, easternmost of the Inner Isles.

     She gazed at that faint dream-shape, dreaming, until a
bird flying from the west over the sea drew her gaze. It
was not a gull, for it flew steadily and too high to be
a pelican. Was it a wild goose, or an albatross, the great,
rare voyager of the open sea, come among the islands? She
watched the slow beat of the wings, far out and high in
the dazzling air. Then she got to her feet, retreating a
little from the cliff's edge, and stood motionless, her
heart going hard and her breath caught in her throat,
watching the sinuous, iron-dark body borne by long, webbed
wings as red as fire, the out-reaching claws, the coils of
smoke fading behind it in the air.

     Straight to Gont it flew, straight to the Overfell, 
straight to her. She saw the glitter of rust-black scales 
and the gleam of the long eye. She saw the red tongue that
was a tongue of flame. The stink of burning filled the
wind, as with a hissing roar the dragon, turning to land
on the shelf of rock, breathed out a sigh of fire.

     Its feet clashed on the rock. The thorny tail, 
writhing, rattled, and the wings, scarlet where the sun
shone through them, stormed and rustled as they folded
down to the mailed flanks. The head turned slowly. The
dragon looked at the woman who stood there within reach
of its scythe-blade talons. The woman looked at the
dragon. She felt the head of its body.

     She had been told that men must not look into a
dragon's eyes, but that was nothing to her. It gazed
straight at her from yellow eyes under armoured 
carapaces wide-set above the narrow nose and flaring,
fuming nostrils. And her small face and dark eyes gazed
straight at it.

     Neither of them spoke.

     The dragon turned its head aside a little so that she
was not destroyed when it did speak, or perhaps it laughed --
a great "Hah!" of orange flame.

     Then it lowered its body into a crouch and spoke, but
not to her. 

     "Ahivaraihe, Ged," it said, mildly enough, smokily,
with a flicker of the burning tongue; and it lowered its
head.

     Tenar saw for the first time, then, the man astride its
back. In the notch between two of the high sword-thorns that
rose in a row down its spine he sat, just behind the neck 
and above the shoulders where the wings had root. His hands
were clenched on the rust-dark mail of the dragon's neck
and his head leaned against the base of the sword-thorn,
as if he were asleep.

     "Ahi eheraihe, Ged!" said the dragon, a little louder,
its long mouth seeming always to smile, showing the teeth as
long as Tenar's forearm, yellowish with white, sharp tips.

     The man did not stir.

     The dragon turned its long head and looked again at
Tenar.

     "Sobriost," it said, in a whisper of steel sliding
over steel.

     That word of the Language of the Making she knew. Ogion
had taught her all she would learn of that tongue, Go up,
the dragon said: mount! And she saw the steps to mount. The
taloned foot, the crooked elbow, the shoulder-joint, the
first musculature of the wing: four steps. 

     She too said, "Hah!" but not in a laugh, only trying to
get her breath, which kept sticking in her throat; and she
lowered her head a moment to stop her dizzy faintness. Then
she went forward, past the talons and the long lipless mouth
and the long yellow eye, and mounted the shoulder of the 
dragon. She took the man's arm. He did not move, but surely
he was not dead, for the dragon had brought him here and
spoken to him. "Come on," she said, and then seeing his face
as she loosened the clenched grip of his left hand, "Come
on, Ged. Come on..."

     He raised his head a little. His eyes were open, but
unseeing. She had to climb around him, scratching her legs
on the hot, mailed hide of the dragon, and unclench his
right hand from a horny knob at the base of the sword-thorn.
She got him to take hold of her arms, and so could carry-drag
him down those four strange stairs to earth.

     He roused enough to try to hold on to her, but there
was no strength in him. He sprawled off the dragon onto
the rock like a sack unloaded, and lay there.

     The dragon turned its immense head and in a completely
animal gesture nosed and sniffed at the man's body.

     It lifted its head, and its wings too half lifted with 
a vast metallic sound. It shifted its feet away from Ged,
closer to the edge of the cliff. Turning back the head on
the thorned neck, it stared once more directly at Tenar,
and its voice like a dry roar of a kiln-fire spoke: 
"Thesse Kalessin."

     The sea wind whistled in the dragon's half-open wings.

     "Thesse Tenar," the woman said in a clear, shaking voice.

     The dragon looked away, westward, over the sea. It
twitched its long body with a clink and clash of iron scales,
then abruptly opened its wings, crouched, and leapt straight
out from the cliff onto the wind. The dragging tail scored the
sandstone as it passed. The red wings beat down, lifted, and
beat down, and already Kalessin was far from land, flying
straight, flying west.

     Tenar watched it till it was no larger than a wild goose
or a gull. The air was cold. When the dragon had been there it
had been hot, furnace-hot, with the dragon's inward fire. Tenar
shivered. She sat down on the rock beside Ged and began to cry.
She hid her face in her arms and wept aloud. "What can I do?"
she cried. "What can I do now?"

     Presently she wiped her eyes and nose on her sleeve, put 
back her hair with both hands, and turned to the man who lay
beside her. He lay so still, so easy on the bare rock, as if
he might lie there forever.

     Tenar sighed. There was nothing she could do, but there 
was always the next thing to be done...
