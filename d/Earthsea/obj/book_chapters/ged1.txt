                    Ged and the Gebbeth
               -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     The slopes of Roke Knoll went up dark into the darkness of
summer night before moonrise. The presence of that hill where 
many wonders had been worked was heavy, like a weight in the air
about them. As they came onto the hillside they thought of how
the roots of it were deep, deeper than the sea, reaching down
even into the old, blind, secret fires at the world's core. They
stopped on the east slope. Stars hung over the black grass above 
them on the hill's crest. No wind blew.

     Ged went a few paces up the slope away from the others and
turning said in a clear voice, "Jasper! Whose spirit shall I call?"

     "Call whom you like. None will listen to you." Jasper's voice
shook a little, with anger perhaps. Ged answered him softly,
mockingly, "Are you afraid?"

     He did not even listen for Jasper's reply, if he made one.
He no longer cared about Jasper. Now that they stood on Roke Knoll,
hate and rage were gone, replaced by utter certainty. He need envy
no one. He knew that his power, this night, on this dark enchanted
ground, was greater than it had ever been, filling him til he
trembled with a sense of strength barely kept in check. He knew
now that Jasper was far beneath him, had been sent perhaps only to
bring him here tonight, no rival but a mere servant of God's destiny.
Under his feet he felt the hillroots going down and down into the
dark, and over his head he saw the dry, far fires of the stars. 
Between, all things were his to order, to command. He stood at the
center of the world.

     "Don't be afraid," he said, smiling. "I'll call a woman's 
spirit. You need not fear a woman. Elfarran I will call, the fair
lady of the Deed of Enlad."

     "She died a thousand years ago, her bones lie afar under the
Sea of Ea, and maybe there never was such a woman."

    "Do years and distances matter to the dead? Do the Songs lie?"
Ged said with the same gentle mockery, and then saying, "Watch the
air between my hands," he turned away from the others and stood
still.

     In a great slow gesture he stretched out his arms, the gesture
of welcome that opens an invocation. He began to speak.

     He had read the runes of this Spell of Summoning in Ogion's
book, two years and more ago, and never since had seen them. In
darkness he had read them then. Now in this darkness it was as
he had read them again on the open page before him in the night.
But now he understood what he read, speaking it aloud word after
word, and he saw the markings of how the spell must be woven with
the sound of the voice and the motion of body and hand.

     The other boys stood watching, not speaking, not moving unless
they shivered a little: for the great spell was beginning to work.
Ged's voice was soft still, but changed, with a deep singing in it,
and the words he spoke were not known to them. He fell silent. 
Suddenly the wind rose roaring in the grass. Ged dropped to his
knees and called out aloud. Then he fell forward as if to embrace
earth with his outstretched arms, and when he rose he held 
something dark in his straining hands and arms, something so
heavy that he shook with effort getting to his feet. The hot wind
whined in the black tossing grasses on the hill. If the stars
shone now none saw them.

     The words of the enchantment hissed and mumbled on Ged's lips,
and then he cried out aloud and clearly, "Elfarran!"

     Again he cried the name, "Elfarran!"

     The shapeless mass of darkness he had lifted split apart. It
sundered, and a pale spindle of light gleamed between his opened
arms, a faint oval reaching from the ground up to the height of
his raised hands. In the oval of light for a moment there moved
a form, a human shape: a tall woman looking back over her shoulder.
Her face was beautiful, and sorrowful, and full of fear.

     Only for a moment did the spirit glimmer there. Then the 
sallow oval between Ged's arms grew bright. It widened and spread,
a rent in the darkness of the earth and night, a ripping open of the
fabric of the world. Through it blazed a terrible brightness. And
through that bright misshapen breach clambered something like a
clot of black shadow, quick and hideous, and it leaped straight
out at Ged's face.

     Staggering back under the weight of the thing, Ged gave a
short, hoarse scream. The little otak watching from Vetch's
shoulder, the animal that had no voice, screamed aloud also
and leaped as if to attack.

     Ged fell, struggling and writhing, while the bright rip in
the world's darkness above him widened and stretched. The boys that
watched fled, and Jasper bent down to the ground hiding his eyes
from the terrible light. Vetch alone ran forward to his friend. So
only he saw the lump of shadow that clung to Ged, tearing at his
flesh. It was like a black beast, the size of a young child, though
it seemed to swell and shrink; and it had no head or face, only the
four taloned paws with which it gripped and tore. Vetch sobbed with
horror, yet he put out his hands to try to pull the thing away from
Ged. Before he touched it, he was bound still, unable to move.

     The intolerable brightness faded, and slowly the torn edges
of the world closed together. Nearby a voice was speaking as softly
as a tree whispers or a fountain plays.

     Starlight began to shine again, and the grasses of the hillside
were whitened with the light of the moon just rising. The night was
healed. Restored and steady lay the balance of light and dark. The
shadow-beast was gone. Ged lay sprawled on his back, his arms
flung out as if they yet kept the wide gesture of welcome and
invocation. His face was blackened with blood and there were great
black stains on his shirt. The little otak cowered by his shoulder,
quivering. And above him stood an old man whose cloak glimmered
pale in the moonrise:  the Archmage Nemmerle.
