                    -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

     In those days the Kargad Empire was strong. Those are four great
lands that lie between the Northern and Eastern Reaches:  Karego-At,
Atuan, Hur-at-Hur, Atnini. The tongue they speak there is not like any
spoken in the Archipelago or the other Reaches, and they are a savage
people, white-skinned, yellow-haired, and fierce, liking the sight of
blood and the smell of burning towns. Last year they had attacked the
Torikles and the strong island Torheven, raiding in great force in 
fleets of red-sailed ships. News of this came north to Gont, but the
Lords of Gont were busy with their piracy and paid small heed to the
woes of other lands. Then Spevy fell to the Kargs and was looted and
laid waste, its people taken as slaves, so that even now it is an
isle of ruins. In lust of conquest the Kargs sailed next to Gont,
coming in a host, thirty great longships, to East Port. They fought
through that town, took it, burned it; leaving their ships under
guard at the mouth of the River Ar they went up the Vale wrecking
and looting, slaughtering cattle and men. As they went they split
their bands, and each of these bands plundered where it chose.
Fugitives brought warning to the villages of the heights. Soon the
people of Ten Alders saw smoke darken the eastern sky, and that
night those who climbed the High Fall looked down on the Vale all
hazed and red-streaked with fires where fields ready for harvest
had been set ablaze, and orchards burned, and fruit roasting on
the blazing boughs, and barns and farmhouses smouldered in ruins.

     Some of the villagers fled up the ravines and hid in the 
forest, and some made ready to fight for their lives, and some
did neither but stood about lamenting. The witch was one who
fled, hiding alone in a cave up on the Kapperding Scarp and
sealing the cave-mouth with spells. Duny's father, the
bronze-smith was one who stayed, for he would not leave his 
smelting-pit and forge where he had worked for fifty years. All
that night he labored beating up what ready metal he had there
into spearpoints, and others worked with him binding these to
the handles of hoes and rakes, there being no time to make
sockets and shaft them properly. There had been no weapons in
the village but hunting bows and short knives, for the mountain
folk of Gont are not warlike; it is not warriors they are famous
for, but goat-thieves, sea-pirates, and wizards.

     With sunrise came a white fog, as on many autumn mornings in
the heights of the island. Among their huts and houses down the
struggling street of Ten Alders the villagers stood waiting with
their hunting bows and new-forged spears, not knowing whether
the Kargs might be far off or very near, all silent, all peering
into the fog that hid shapes and distances and dangers from their
eyes.

     With them was Duny. He had worked all night at the forge-
bellows, pushing and pulling the two long sleeves of goathide
that fed the fire with a blast of air. Now his arms so ached
and trembled from that work that he could not hold out the
spear he had chosen. He did not see how he could fight or be of
any good to himself or the villagers. It rankled at his heart
that he should die, spitted on a Kargish lance, while still
a boy: that he should go into the dark land without ever
having known his own name, his true name as a man. He looked
down at his thin arms, wet with cold fog-dew, and raged at his
weakness, for he knew his strength. There was power in him, if
he knew how to use it, and he sought among all the spells he
knew for some device that might give him and his companions an
advantage, or at least a chance. But need alone is not enough
to set power free:  there must be knowledge.

     The fog was thinning now under the heat of the sun that 
shone bare above on the peak in a bright sky. As the mists
moved and parted in great drifts and smoky wisps, the villagers
saw a band of warriors coming up the mountain. They were
armoured with bronze helmets and greaves and breastplates of
heavy leather and shields of wood and bronze, and armed with
swords and the long Kargish lance. Winding up along the steep
bank of the Ar they came in a plumed, clanking, straggling 
line, near enough already that their white faces could be
seen, and the words of their jargon heard as they shouted
to one another. In this band of the invading horde there
were about a hundred men, which is not many; but in the
village were only eighteen men and boys.

     Now need called knowledge out:  Duny, seeing the fog
blow and thin across the path before the Kargs, saw a spell
that might avail him. An old weatherworker of the Vale,
seeking to win the boy as prentice, had taught him several
charms. One of these tricks was called fogweaving, a
binding-spell that gathers mists together for a while in
one place; with it one skilled in illusion can shape the
mist into fair ghostly seemings, which last a little and
fade away. The boy had no such skill, but his intent was
different, and he had the strength to turn the spell to
his own ends. Rapidly and aloud he named the places and
boundaries of the village, and then spoke the fogweaving
charm, but in among its words he enlaced the words of
a spell of concealment, and last he cried the word that 
set the magic going.

     Even as he did so his father coming up behind him 
struck him hard on the side of the head, knocking him
right down. "Be still, fool! keep your blattering mouth
shut, and hide if you can't fight!"

     Duny got to his feet. He could hear the Kargs now
at the end of the village, as near as the great yew 
tree by the tanner's yard. Their voices were clear, and
the clink and creak of their harness and arms, but they
could not be seen. The fog had closed and thickened all
over the village, greying the light, blurring the world
till a man could hardly see his own hands before him.

     "I've hidden us all," Duny said, sullenly, for his
head hurt from his father's blow, and the working of the
double incantation had drained his strength. "I'll keep
up this fog as long as I can. Get the others to lead them
up to High Fall."

     The smith stared at his son who stood wraithlike in 
that weird, dank mist. It took him a minute to see Duny's
meaning, but when he did he ran at once, noiselessly,
knowing every fence and corner of the village, to find
the others and tell them what to do. Now through the grey
fog bloomed a blur of red, as the Kargs set fire to the
thatch of a house. Still they did not come up into the 
village, but waited at the lower end till the mist should
lift and lay bare their loot and prey.

     The tanner, whose house it was that burned, sent a
couple of boys skipping right under the Kargs' noses,
taunting and yelling and vanishing again like smoke into
smoke. Meantime the older men, creeping behind fences and running
from house to house, came close on the other side and sent
a volley of arrows and spears at the warriors, who stood all
in a bunch. One Karg fell writhing with a spear, still warm
from its forging, right through his body. Others were arrow-
bitten, and all enraged. They charged forward then to hew 
down their puny attackers, but they found only the fog about
them, full of voices. They followed the voices, stabbing ahead
into the mist with their great plumed, bloodstained lances.
Up the length of the street they came shouting, and never knew
they had run right through the village, as the empty huts and
houses loomed and disappeared again in the writhing grey fog.
The villagers ran scattering, most of them keeping well ahead
since they knew the ground; but some boys or old men, were
slow. The Kargs stumbling on them drove their lances or hacked
with their swords, yelling their war-cry, the names of the
White Godbrothers of Atuan:

     "Wuluah! Atwah!"

     Some of the band stopped when they felt the land grow rough
underfoot, but others pressed right on, seeking the phantom
village, following dim wavering shapes that fled just out of 
reach before them. All the mist had come alive with those fleeting
forms, dodging, flickering, fading on every side. One group of
the Kargs chased the wraiths straight to the High Fall, the cliff's
edge above the springs of Ar, and the shapes they pursued ran
out into the air, and there vanished in a thinning of the mist,
while the pursuers fell screaming through fog and sudden sunlight
a hundred feet sheer to the shallow pools among the rocks. And 
those that came behind and did not fall stood at the cliff's
edge, listening.

     Now dread came into the Kargs' hearts and they began to seek
one another, not the villagers in the uncanny mist. They gathered
on the hillside, and yet always there were wraiths and ghost-
shapes among them, and other shapes that ran and stabbed from
behind with spear or knife and vanished again. The Kargs began
to run, all of them, downhill, stumbling, silent, until all at
once they ran out from the grey blind mist and saw the rivers
and ravines below the village all bare and bright in the morning
sunlight. Then they stopped, gathering together, and looked back.
A wall of wavering writhing grey lay blank across the path, 
hiding all that lay behind it. Out from it burst two or three
stragglers, lunging and stumbling along, their long lances
rocking on their shoulders. Not one Karg looked back more
than that once. All went down, in haste, away from the enchanted
place.

     Farther down the Northward Vale those warriors got their
fill of fighting. The towns of the East Forest, from Ovark to
the coast, had gathered their men and sent them against the
invaders of Gont. Band after band they came down from the hills,
and that day and teh next the Kargs were harried back down to the 
beaches above East Port, where they found their ships burnt; so
they fought with their backs to the sea till every man of them
was killed, and the sands of Armouth were brown with blood until
the tide came in.

     But on that morning in Ten Alders village and up on the
High Fall, the dank grey fog had clung a while, and then
suddenly it blew and drifted and melted away.  This man 
and that stood up in the windy brightness of the morning, and
looked about him wondering. Here lay a dead Karg with yellow
hair long, loose, and bloody; there lay the village tanner,
killed in battle like a king.

     Down in the village the house that had been set afire
still blazed. They ran to put the fire out, since their battle
had been won. In the street, near the great yew, they found
Duny the bronze-smith's son standing by himself, bearing no
hurt, but speechless and stupid like one stunned. They were
well aware of what he had done, and they led him into his
father's house and went calling for the witch to come down
out of her cave and heal the lad who had saved their lives
and their property, all but four who were killed by the
Kargs, and the one house that was burnt.

     No weapon-hurt had come to the boy, but he would not
speak nor eat nor sleep; he seemed not to hear what was
said to him, not to see those who came to see him. There
was none in those parts wizard enough to cure what ailed
him. His aunt said, "He has overspent his power," but she
had no art to help him.

     While he lay thus dark and dumb, the story of the lad
who wove the fog and scared off the Kargish swordsmen with
a mess of shadows was told all down the Northward Vale, and
in the East Forest, and high on the mountain and over the
mountain even in the Great Port of Gont. So it happened that
on the fifth day after the slaughter at Armouth a stranger
came into Ten Alders village, a man neither young nor old,
who came cloaked and bareheaded, lightly carrying a great
staff of oak that was as tall as himself. He did not come
up the course of the Ar like most people, but down, out of 
the forests of the higher mountainside. The village goodwives
saw well that he was a wizard, and when he told them that
he was a healall, they brought him straight to the smith's
house. Sending all away but the boy's father and aunt the
stranger stooped above the cot where Duny lay staring into
the dark, and did no more than lay his hand on the boy's
forehead and touch his lips once.

     Duny sat up slowly looking about him. In a little while
he spoke, and strength and hunger began to come back into him...


     The witch whispered to the smith, "Brother, this must
surely be the Mage of Re Albi, Ogion the Silent, that one
who tamed the earthquake--"

     "Sir," said the bronze-smith who would not let a great
name daunt him, "my son will be thirteen this month coming,
but we thought to hold his Passage at the feast of Sunreturn
this winter."

     "Let him be named as soon as may be," said the mage, "for
he needs his name. I have other business now, but I will come
back here for the day you choose. If you see fit I will take
him with me when I go thereafter. And if he proves apt I will
keep him as prentice, or see to it that he is schooled as fits
his gifts. For to keep dark the mind of the mageborn, that
is a dangerous thing."

     Very gently Ogion spoke, but with certainty, and even the
hardheaded smith assented to all he said.

     On the day the boy was thirteen years old, a day in the
early splendor of autumn while still the right leaves are on
the trees, Ogion returned to the village from his rovings over
Gont Mountain, and the ceremony of Passage was held. The witch
took from the boy his name Duny, the name his mother had given
him as a baby. Nameless and naked he walked into the cold 
springs of the Ar where it rises among rocks under the high
cliffs. As he entered the water clouds crossed the sun's face
and great shadows slid and mingled over the pool about him.
He crossed to the far bank, shuddering with cold but walking
slow and erect as he should through that icy, living water.
As he came to the bank Ogion, waiting, reached out his hand
and clasping the boy's arm whispered to him his true name:
Ged.

     Thus was he given his name by one very wise in the uses
of power.

     The feasting was far from over, and all the villagers
were making merry with plenty to eat and beer to drink and
a chanter from down in the Vale singing the Deed of the
Dragonlords, when the mage spoke in his quiet voice to Ged:
"Come, lad. Bid your people farewell and leave them feasting."

     Ged fetched what he had to carry, which was the good
bronze knife his father had forged him, and a leather coat
the tanner's widow had cut down to his size, and an 
alder-stick his aunt had becharmed for him: that was all he
owned besides his shirt and breeches. He said farewell to
them, all the people he knew in all the world, and looked
about once at that village that straggled and huddled there
under the cliffs, over the river-springs. Then he set off
with his new master through the steep slanting forests of
the mountain isle, through the leaves and shadows of bright
autumn.
