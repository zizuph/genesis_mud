                        The Order of the Dragon


Corudin was born on the island of Oranea, one of the many islands
of Earthsea. He grew to into manhood herding goats in the dragon-shadow 
of Mount Erakuk. Corudin spent much of his childhood lying in fragrant 
grass, staring up at the sky and listening to the faint sounds of the 
surf far below. His thoughts winged from place to place, never alighting 
upon one subject for long, but always turning in some form or another 
to the subject of dragons. Most Oraneans had lived so long at the foot
of Erakuk that they no longer noticed that the granite of the mountain 
had weathered into a dragon-shape. Few Oraneans even believed in the
existence of dragons, yet once a year, after harvest and shearing season, 
two youths, one male and one female, climbed Erakuk and left simple 
offerings of barley and cloth for Segoy, the Dragon-Father of Creation. 

It was a tradition hundreds of generations old, its origin and purpose 
lost in the mists of time, and yet it was a special day and a special 
honour for which all the young people of Oranea vied. Corudin was a
smallish man, but he was lithe and fit, and upon this occasion in his 
seventeenth summer, he won for himself the honour of gift-bearer. He 
and his partner, Lura, solemnly carried their their offerings up the 
treacherous route carved into the steep sides of Mount Erakuk. Corudin
spent much of the climb meditating upon the creation myth surrounding 
Segoy, and upon the nature of dragons. He leapt gracefully from stone 
to stone, his body fairly flying through the air. He twirled his 
shepherd's staff about, listening to its singing whoosh and wondering 
if the sound was anything like that which a dragon's wings would make 
if it swooped down from the sky. Joy sparked from his eyes and infected 
Lura, and they both arrived at the top of Mount Erakuk breathless and
giggling. 

After placing the village gifts upon a flat, oval stone, and reciting 
a prayer of thanks, Lura and Corudin walked hand-in-hand to the edge
of the mountain and looked out over Oranea. They laughed when they
spotted their village and the tiny people moving about like so many
ants. But laughter died in their throats when they saw that two ships 
had weighed anchor in the little harbour, and several small boats 
were rowing in to shore. Raiders. Corudin and Lura tried yelling,
but their voices did not carry far enough. Corudin, staff in hand,
scrambled down the mountainside. He could hear Lura behind him, crying
out for him to wait for her, but he ignored her calls. 

He ran into town, breathless and nearly staggering, and charged toward
a raider who was dragging a woman out of her home by her hair. He cracked 
his staff over the raider's arm and the man bellowed, yanked the staff 
from Corudin's hands, and hit him in the belly with the butt. Corudin 
fell hard, losing the breath from his lungs, and the raider turned back
to the woman. Corudin lay upon the ground and stared up into the clear
blue sky, sounded by screams and the smell of smoke and fighting for 
breath. Mentally, he shouted his rage and helplessness into the clouds,
wishing he was stronger, faster, fiercer, not a goatherd, but a great,
fanged wolf or a dragon that could tear the raiders limb-from-limb with
its claws. He focussed upon that wish as he lay there, and his body,
unknown to him, eased, and answered his commands to stand, and fight.

Corudin, in a time of sheer, visceral need, called upon something deep
within himself, and -became- dragon. He fought as no one had seen before,
with deadly grace and economy of movement. His fists here warhammers,
denting armour and breaking jaws. He ripped open throats with fingers
like claws. Knees broke under the force of kicks from his from his bare 
feet. His cries pierced the air and filled the raiders hearts with dread.
When it was done, Corudin stood over seven dead. 


The raiders, ten fewer than when they began, ran to their boats and rowed
furiously out to sea. Corudin stared at the gore dripping from his fingers 
as the dragon-focus ebbed away, leaving him exhausted and empty, but 
curiously at peace. He remembered clearly everything he had done, and 
how. Weeks later, after the village had returned to normal, Corudin took 
a ship to Gont in search of a place to learn the arts of combat. His 
travels took him far and wide, and rumours of him spread -- rumours of 
a great warrior who could kill with his bare hands. The time came when he 
could learn no more, and Corudin returned home to Oranea, and withdrew
to Mount Erakuk. 

There he lived a simple life of meditation and physical discipline. He
mastered body and mind and taught himself to focus the dragon-spirit 
within at will. In time, others began climbing Erakuk to see him, asking 
him to teach them his Way of killing. And Corudin would, with a single 
stroke, knock the would-be disciples to the ground and tell them, "I 
will not teach you to kill. It is not my Way." Some would strike back, 
only to find themselves lying in the dirt, gasping with pain. Others 
would grumble and make their way back down the mountain, never to return. 
But a rare few would ask, "What, then, do you teach, Master Corudin?" 
And he would, with a breath, slide into dragon-focus, and his fiery, 
wise eyes would stare first at his own hands and then into their soul. 
If what he saw there pleased him, he would answer, "How to live, child. 
Only how to Live."

The Order of the Dragon welcomes any who would learn the Way of Master
Corudin, who sought to teach people how to truly live by mastering mind 
and body through dragon-discipline. He taught the mastery of death-bringing,
not for mere killing, but in defence of Life and the sacred balance of 
Nature.
