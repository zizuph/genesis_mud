                      The Hawk's Flight
                -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
     Ogion the Silent had come home late to Re Albi
from his autumn wanderings. More silent, more solitary than
ever he had become as the years went on. The new Lord of Gont
down in the city below had never got a word out of him, though
he had climbed clear up to the Falcon's Nest to seek the help
of the mage in a certain piratic venture towards the Andrades.
Ogion who spoke to spiders on their webs and had been seen to
greet trees courteously never said a word to the Lord of the
Isle, who went away discontented. There was perhaps some 
discontent or unease also in Ogion's mind, for he had spent all
summer and autumn alone up on the mountain, and only now near
Sunreturn was come back to his hearthside.

     The morning after his return he rose late, and wanting
a cup of rushwash tea he went out to fetch water from the
spring that ran a little way down the hillside from his house.
The margins of the spring's small lively pool were frozen, and 
the sere moss among the rocks was traced with flowers of frost.
It was broad daylight, but the sun would not clear the mighty
shoulder of the mountain for an hour yet: all western Gont,
from sea-beaches to the peak, was sunless, silent, and clear
in the winter morning. As the mage stood by the spring looking
out over the falling lands and the harbor and the grey distances
of the sea, wings beat above him. He looked up, raising one arm
a little. A great hawk came down with loud-beating wings and 
lighted on his wrist. Like a trained hunting-bird it clung
there, but it wore no broken leash, no band or bell. The claws
dug hard in Ogion's wrist; the barred wings trembled; the
round, gold eye was dull and wild.

     "Are you messenger or message?" Ogion said gently to the
hawk. "Come on with me--" As he spoke the hawk looked at him.
Ogion was silent a minute. "I named you once, I think," he 
said, and then strode to his house and entered, bearing the
bird still on his wrist. He made the hawk stand on the hearth
in the fire's heat, and offered it water. It would not drink. 
Then Ogion began to lay a spell, very quietly, weaving the
web of magic with his hands more than with words. When the
spell was whole and woven he said softly, --"Ged"-- not looking
at the falcon on the hearth. He waited some while, then turned,
and got up, and went to the young man who stood trembling and
dull-eyed before the fire.

     Ged was richly and outlandishly dressed in fur and silk 
and silver, but the clothes were torn and stiff with sea-salt,
and he stood gaunt and stooped, his hair lank about his scarred
face.

     Ogion took the soiled princely cloak off his shoulders,
led him to the alcove-room where his prentice once had slept
and made him lie down on the pallet there, and so with a 
murmured sleep-charm left him. He had said no word to him,
knowing that Ged had no human speech in him now.

     As a boy, Ogion like all boys had thought it would be
a very pleasant game to take by art-magic whatever shape
one liked, man or beast, tree or cloud, and so to play at
a thousand beings. But as a wizard he had learned the price
of the game, which is the peril of losing one's self,
playing away the truth. The longer a man stays in a form
not his own, the greater the peril ...

     Ged had taken hawk-shape in fierce distress and rage,
and when he flew from Osskil there had been but one thought
in his mind: to outfly both Stone and shadow, to escape the
cold treacherous lands, to go home. The falcon's anger and
wildness were like his own, and had become his own, and his
will to fly had become the falcon's will. Thus he had passed
over Enlad, stooping down to drink at a lonely forest pool,
but on the wing again at once, driven by fear of the shadow
that came behind him. So he had crossed the great sea-lane
called the Jaws of Enlad, and gone on and on, east by south,
the hills of Oranea faint to his right and the hills of 
Andrad fainter to his left, and before him only the sea;
until at last, ahead there rose up out of the waves one
unchanging wave, towering always higher, the white peak of
Gont. In all the sunlight and the dark of that great flight
he had worn the falcon's wings, and looked through the 
falcon's eyes, and forgetting his own thoughts he had known
at last only what the falcon knows: hunger, the wind, the
way he flies.

     He flew to the right haven. There were few on Roke and
only one on Gont who could have made him back into a man.

     He was savage and silent when he woke. Ogion never spoke
to him, but gave him meat and water and let him sit hunched
by the fire, grim as a great, weary, sulking hawk. When night
came he slept. On the third morning he came in to the fireside
where the mage sat gazing at the flames and said, "Master ..."

     "Welcome, lad," said Ogion.

     "I have come back to you as I left: a fool," the young man
said, his voice harsh and thickened. The mage smiled a little
and motioned Ged to sit across the hearth from him, and set
to brewing them some tea.

     Snow was falling, the first of the winter here on the lower
slopes of Gont. Ogion's windows were shuttered fast, but they 
could hear the wet snow as it fell soft on the roof, and the
deep stillness of snow all about the house. A long time they 
sat there by the fire, and Ged told his old master the tale
of the years since he had sailed from Gont aboard the ship
called Shadow. Ogion asked no questions, and when Ged was
done he kept silent for a long time, calm, pondering. Then
he rose, and set out bread and cheese and wine on the table,
and they ate together. When they had done and had set the
room straight, Ogion spoke.

     "Those are bitter scars you bear, lad," he said ...

     He fell to brooding again. At last Ged said, "I came
here for counsel, not for refuge, Master. I will not bring
this shadow upon you, and it will soon be here if I stay.
Once you drove it from this very room--"

     "No, that was but the foreboding of it, the shadow of
a shadow. I could not drive it forth, now. Only you could
do that."

     "But I am powerless before it. Is there any place ... "
His voice died away before he had asked the question.

     "There is no safe place," Ogion said gently. "Do not
transform yourself again, Ged. The shadow seeks to destroy
your true being. It nearly did so, driving you into hawk's
being. No, where you should go, I do not know. Yet I have
an idea of what you should do. It is a hard thing to say to
you."

     Ged's silence demanded truth, and Ogion said at last,
"You must turn around."

     "Turn around?"

     "If you go ahead, if you keep running, wherever you run
you will meet danger and evil, for it drives you, it chooses
the way you go. You must choose. You must seek what seeks you.
You must hunt the hunter."

     Ged said nothing.

     "At the spring of the River Ar I named you," the mage
said, "a stream that falls from the mountain to the sea. A
man would know the end he goes to, but he cannot know it if
he does not turn, and return to his beginning, and hold that
beginning in his being. If he would not be a stick whirled 
and whelmed in a stream, he must be the stream itself, all
of it, from its spring to its sinking in the sea. You returned
to Gont, you returned to me, Ged. Now turn clear round, and 
seek the very source, and that which lies before the source.
There lies your hope of strength."

     "There, Master?" Ged said with terror in his voice--
"Where?"

     Ogion did not answer... He got up, and built up the fire
to a good blaze, and hung the kettle over it to boil, and
then pulling on his sheepskin coat said, "I must go look after
my goats. Watch the kettle for me, lad."

     When he came back in, all snow-powdered and stamping snow
from his goatskin boots, he carried a long, rough shaft of
yew-wood. All the end of the short afternoon, and again after
their supper, he sat working by lampfire on the shaft with knife
and rubbing-stone and spell-craft. Many times he passed his hands
along the wood as if seeking any flaw. Often as he worked he
sang softly. Ged, still weary, listened, and as he grew sleepy
he thought himself a child in the witch's hut in Ten Alders
village, on a snowy night in the firelit dark, the air heavy
with herb-scent and smoke, and his mind all adrift on dreams
as he listened to the long soft singing of spells and deeds of
heroes who fought against dark powers and won, or lost, on
distant islands long ago.

     "There," said Ogion, and handed the finished staff to him.
"The Archmage gave you yew-wood, a good choice and I kept to 
it. I meant the shaft for a longbow, but it's better this
way. Good night, my son."

     As Ged, who found no words to thank him, turned away to
his alcove-room, Ogion watched him and said, too soft for
Ged to hear, "O my young falcon, fly well!"

     In the cold dawn when Ogion woke, Ged was gone. Only he
had left in wizardly fashion a message of silver-scrawled 
runes on the hearthstone, that faded even as Ogion read
them: "Master, I go hunting."
