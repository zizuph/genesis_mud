some followers. They decided to inhabit a nearby 
island and rebuild the once glorious guild. They hid 
it well, for the mystery to last. Only one well hidden
exit was left, deep in the forest. Later an underground
tunnel from the guildhalls to one of the houses in Gont
was built. Its entrance has also been camuflaged, with
such skill that only aware guildmembers could notice it.
