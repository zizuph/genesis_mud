       About Tricksters guild

The Tricksters are followers of dark Goddess Kina,
the Goddess of Mischief and Lies. Kina enjoys fooling
people, and she enjoys even more fooling her own
worshipers, for she truelly is a treacherous deity.
Tricksters themselves enjoy fooling people, like
their Goddess, nevertheless they are not harmless
funlovers. Their rituals are dark, and often people
are sacrificed to Kina. The society is also known as 
the Stranglers, for they strangle people using rumels,
scarves made of heavy and sturdy material. Tricksters 
dislike bloodspilling, thus they prefer just to break 
someone's neck using their rumels.
