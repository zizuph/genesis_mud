================= DAY 7 ===================

We have finally passed the forest!
It was really scary expirience for us!
Especially at night , it seems that
forest has life of its own , and it
doesn't exactly like the intruders! We
have settled small encampment to block
the access to area where we gonna build
the fortress. Now we will have to send
a message back to Empire and wait for
main forces to come.

Glory to Karg Empire!
