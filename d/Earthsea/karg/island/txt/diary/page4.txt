================= DAY 4 ===================

The explore party has returned! Only
an officer and two soldiers has returned.
All the rest were lost in forest. They
reported that forest is unusually dense,
and it seems magical , so people with
low orientation skills may lose the track 
forever! The party has also discovered
big rocky area , surrounded by cliffs ,
which can be used for our main target - 
building a fortress! Tomorrow with a
sunrise we shell move through the forest
to secure the place and settle an outpost.

Glory to Karg Empire!
