================= DAY 5 ===================

With a sunrise we have packed our
inventory and started to move towards
forest. Forest was tricky indeed! If it's
not for explore party we have sent before
we would surely get lost! It seems there
is only one path through forest, and if
you move one step away of it - you are
doomed!

Glory to Karg Empire!
