================= DAY 19 ===================

Today one of the prisoners has returned! He
managed to escape. He told us about dark
rituals and sacrifices , that were really
creepy! But the most important he has
managed to see a hidden exit! People who
attacked us call themselves "Stranglers".
The worship dark goddess Kina. We will now
gather a forces to attack their hidden lair,
which can be accessed via tree hidden deep
in forest in a dead end.

Glory to Karg Empire!
