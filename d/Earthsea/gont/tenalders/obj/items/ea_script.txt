              The Creation of Ea

     The making from the unmaking,
     The ending from the beginning,
     Who shall know surely?
     What we know is the doorway between them
        that we enter departing.
     Among all beings ever returning,
     the eldest, the Doorkeeper, Segoy,
     who spoke the first Word
     in the beginning of time, and the
     sea trembled and rose in a great
     wave crowned in salt foam.
     Then from the foam bright Ea broke.
          
     Across the lands the winds blew
     a spirit breath, caressing her,
     and from this union, Ea brought forth
     her first born: the Dragon.
    
     [here the parchment becomes unreadable]
     [then it ends with these words:]     

     Only in silence the word,
     only in dark the light,
     only in dying life:
     bright the hawk's flight
     on the empty sky.
