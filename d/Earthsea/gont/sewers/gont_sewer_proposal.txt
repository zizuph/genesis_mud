Overview
--------
This will be a dynamic killing field underneath the streets of Gont city.
It will be shrouded in darkness and contain NPCs and herbs. The tunnels 
will have a flow system that moves non-living items downstream. As of this
moment, no quests are associated with the sewers and the NPCs will be around
the same size as the guards in the current tower or thereabout.

-All rooms will have water present, but not be underwater.
-All rooms will be dark.
-Access points will have some way to reach the surface (be it manhole or pipe)
-Landmarks are not relevant, except for desc_long flair and the potential
	for expansion.
-The exit point on the map is where the water will be dumped into the ocean.
	- All upriver rooms flow to this spot.
	- Desc: NPC scavengers have built a damming structure to catch loot.
	- NPC scavengers will be picking through anything that drifts in.
- Tributary pipes can be found in every non-crescent room.
	- Pipes act like basic portals to a random sewer room.
	- Allows for randomness for fun and potential escape from PVP.
	- "Crawling along, you reach a juncture and impulsively turn <dir>."
	- "You emerge from the pipe into another area of the sewer system."

NPCs
----
-Basic rats/snakes/amphibians - peaceful
-Sewer dragons (large harekki?)
	- acid/poison immunities and acid/poison style attacks
	- not huge... maybe hero sized
	- skin cloak
	- peaceful
-Humanoids
	- Scavengers in the exit room - mundane stats and gear - peaceful

Noteworthy Items
----------------
- Sewer Dragon Skin
	- Average AC cloak that provides some acid protection.
- Iron Caged Torch
	- Decent club that is wielded by some NPCs
	- Deals blunt and fire damage (when lit)
	- Can be refueled by applying oil (standard used in lamps)
