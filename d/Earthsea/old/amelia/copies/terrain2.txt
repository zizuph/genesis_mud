TERRAINS - Types and use.
=========================

Please note, this is a temporary document that will be modified in the
future before terrain types are implemented. Not only will I include some
of the future manual, but also explain some of the potentials of terrain
types, of which the latter will be removed later on. /Teth.

The header file is currently in /d/Krynn/teth/open/terrain.h.

The purpose of this document is to detail the terrain types, and explain
their use, in the Genesis game setting. It does not currently include
an example of how to include a terrain in a room, as that is yet to
be discussed, however it is certain that it will be a property.

Terrain types can be used for many things in the lands of Genesis, and
offer a new dimension to domain and guild code. There is the possibility
that terrain types will allow implementation of steeds in an easier
manner, as well as one day in the long term future, allow range weapons.
It is also hoped that they can be used to allow people to search for common
items in environments that they should be found in, eg sand on a beach,
or a stick in the forest. Theoretically, they could also be used to create
specific components, such as a handful of soil from a graveyard, allowing
an increased variety of spell components. There are many other dimensions
to terrain types that can add flavour to the game, and these are explained
below...

The terrain properties are defined with binary encoding in mind, and as such,
are created to be as simple to implement as possible. This means,
in most cases, the wizard should be able to get away with adding only
one prop to the room, and in rare cases, two or three, more perhaps if
it is a unique environment. For example, TERRAIN_FOREST, by definition,
already states that the environment is TERRAIN_OUTDOOR, TERRAIN_NATURAL,
TERRAIN_PLANT, TERRAIN_TREE, TERRAIN_WILDERNESS, and TERRAIN_SHADY.
So instead of adding 6 props, only one is necessary.

One small drawback which might exist in some cases, is that to maximize
the amount of terrains allowable, it was necessary to define the terrain
types as present/not present, at the most basic levels. In other words,
instead of one define for TERRAIN_OUTDOOR and one define for TERRAIN_INDOOR,
only TERRAIN_OUTDOOR is defined, while the indoor terrain is default.
The default terrain is a small indoor room, with an air medium, aboveground,
and not a habitation. This will become more obvious with an explanation
of the details of the terrain defines.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is an explanation of the various defines for terrain types.

TERRAIN_OUTSIDE - This is used simply to define whether a room is outside
	or inside. This is one of the basic defines the entire terrain system
	terrain system is based on. To define a room as outside, it must meet
        several criteria: - it must not be significantly walled in
                          - if it is walled in, it must have little to no
                            ceiling, and thus exposed to the sun and 
                            sky/water above.

TERRAIN_NATURAL - This is used to determine whether the environment of
	this room is natural or artificial/constructed in origin. Does the
	room have features that were created by nature, or does it have
	something that was built? A hilltop with glacial rocks would be
	natural, while ruins on the hilltop would be artificial.

TERRAIN_UNDERWATER - This define will denote terrains that are under the
	surface of a water body, be it a lake, ocean or well.

TERRAIN_OPENSPACE - This define is to be used for areas that allow much
	freedom of movement. To use it properly, many variables must be
	considered, such as room dimension and clutter. This pivotal
	define can be used for many things: - range weapons allowable
                                            - absence can mean that certain
                                              special attacks won't work
                                            - whether a horse can move
                                              into the room or not

TERRAIN_INAIR - This type is to be used for rooms that do not have any
	ground to stand on. The best example is a room in the sky.

TERRAIN_ONWATER - This type is to be used for rooms in which the person
	is swimming in the water, or a boat is floating on the water, but
	is not entirely submerged.

TERRAIN_UNDERGROUND - This type is to be used for caverns, mines, dungeons,
	and such that are below the surface of the realms.

TERRAIN_WATERFLOW - This type is to be used if there is a significant
	current in the water environment the player is swimming in.
	Having this terrain type might make it harder to swim.

TERRAIN_SALTYWTR - This type is to be used if the environment contains
	salt water.

TERRAIN_FRESHWTR - This type is to be used if the environment contains
	fresh water. Of course, this water should most often be drinkable.

TERRAIN_TREE - This type is to be used if the environment contains trees.
	A possibility might exist to have a default 'climbable' tree in
	these types of terrains, just to add some flavour.

TERRAIN_WET - This type is to be used if the area is 'wet'. It doesn't
	necessarily have to contain water, or any readily apparent
	liquid at all, but it should contain something wet, like saturated
	soil.

TERRAIN_SAND - This type is to be used if the substrate of the ground 
	is sandy. It should be possible to pick up handfuls of sand from
	places with this terrain type.

TERRAIN_SOIL - This type is to be used if the substrate of the ground has
	a fair amount of soil.

TERRAIN_HUMID - This type is to be used if the 'air' of the environment
	is moist, misty or foggy. Also, it should also be used in water
	environments as well, just for compatibility with possible future
	spells.

TERRAIN_LAVA - This type is to be used if the area contains lava.

TERRAIN_ICE - This terrain type is to be used if the area contains ice,
	and it should perhaps be possible to have it so that one can
	chip away at the ice and get small fragments.

TERRAIN_CLUTTER - This type is to be used if the area is cluttered,
	or filled with items, even if they are only add_items in the
	room description. It might make it more possible to hide.

TERRAIN_PLANT - This terrain type is _not_ to be used to determine if
	herbs are present or not, even though this system will work with
	herbs nicely. Instead, this terrain type should be used if there
	is suitable grazing areas for horses.

TERRAIN_MUD - This terrain type is the combination of TERRAIN_WET and
	TERRAIN_SOIL. If both are present, it should be able to collect
	mud.

TERRAIN_LARGE - This terrain type is used mostly to differentiate some
	of the more complex terrain types (a lake to a pond for example).

TERRAIN_ROUGH - This type is to be used for areas that are difficult to
	travel through, whether by swimming or walking.

TERRAIN_STEEP - This type is to be used also for areas that are difficult
	to travel through, but instead are at an incline rather than
	flat or horizontal.

TERRAIN_SPLOTCHY - This type is to be used for areas that are non-uniform,
	clumped or random. An area like this would be badlands, where
	there is a lack of consistency in the terrain.

TERRAIN_CROWDED - This type is to be used for areas that have many people
	or other inhabitants. In areas that are crowded, it should of
	course be easier to steal, but far more difficult to hide or
	sneak. It should also be difficult to maneuver effectively.

TERRAIN_SHADY - Shady type areas are those that have a significant amount
	of shadows. Alleys and ruins are typical of this type, that can
	be used to increase the effectiveness of hide and sneak.

TERRAIN_RESIDENCE - This terrain is to be used for areas that are
	domiciles, lairs, habitations, and houses.

TERRAIN_HASDEAD - This type is to be used in areas that have, or have
	historically had, many dead. This would include ancient
	battlefields, graveyards and tombs.

TERRAIN_ONBOAT - This terrain type is to be used most specifically on
	boats. It might be used for some special spells, perhaps, or
	give the pirates guilds some bonuses there. ;-)
