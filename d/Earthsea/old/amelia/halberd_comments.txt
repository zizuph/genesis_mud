A few code issues:

1) You must call ::did_hit() from your did_hit() function.  Your
   halberd never dulls if you don't do this.  If you intentionally
   did that, you need to document it.
2) Don't use your own tell_watcher() function.  There is one already
   in the mudlib (in addition to tell_watcher_miss(), which you should
   also be using).
3) Your MAGIC_AM_MAGIC and MAGIC_AM_ID_INFO are incorrectly set.  Also,
   your OBJ_S_WIZINFO is inadequate.  It should also describe what the
   halberd does.
4) In did_hit(), return immediately if (random(x)).  Don't waste cpu
   by executing more code only to abort.
5) Using QCTNAME for messages to only one living is wasteful.  Use
   query_The_name() instead.  Also, use catch_tell(), tell_object(),
   or write() when you don't have VBFC's in the string.
6) NEVER do query_stat(4).  Always use SS_WIS.
7) Doing a call_other() (->) to this_object() is wasteful when you
   can safely assume that the function being called is not going to
   be shadowed.  Use internal calls.
8) this_player()->catch_msg() bad; write() good.
9) You really should use parse_command() in the "swing" command.

That's all I see just looking over it quickly.
