*****Introduction*****

The Wizards of Roke as described in Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea series 
are wizards that draw their power from manipulating "true names".  
Whether it is summoning fire or calming an earthquake they must speak 
in "true speech", also the language of dragons that live in Earthsea.
They're adept at sea and are masters at manipulating wind; seafarers
all over Earthsea gladly welcome Roke wizards aboard because of their
abilities to summon fair winds.  Roke wizards come from all walks of
life from royalty to maurading kargs.  They often still practice their
original profession, goat herding, smithing, farming, and etc even 
after they learn the high arts of Roke.  Women, however, are not allowed
to learn from Roke, though the great mage Ogion's master's master was
a woman.  Abilities that feature prominently in the books include 
transforming into creatures such as sea gulls, hawks, and even dragons 
(human beings are also theoretically possible), blocking an opponent's 
spell casting abilities, manipulating wind, generating illusions and 
summoning dead souls.

*****Role in Earthsea and Genesis*****

Their role in Earthsea for those not well versed in Earthsea lore, is
much like the role of the Jedi Order in George Lucas' Star Wars'
Old Republic.  Like the Jedi Order, they stress the importance of natural
balance and are careful to not disturb it.  Thus they do not participate
in crusades or meddle in political affair much, though they are good
aligned.  However, they do whatever is necessary to keep peace and
prosperity in the lands they roam and hold influence over.  The nine
Masters of Roke are held in the same regard as the great princes of
Earthsea where Roke is held in reverence.  The Archmage answers to no
one except perhaps the long absent kings of Earthsea and only because
the Archmages have always done so voluntarily.  There's really nothing 
anyone can do to subjugate a powerful mage like the Archmage.  In 
Genesis Roke will be barred from entering into formal guild alliances,
but they may still declare guild wars if attacked and individual mages
may assist any good aligned causes at their own discretion if not
explicitly forbidden by the Archmage.

*****Guild Location and Internal Dynamics**********

The Wizard's School is located in Thwil on the island of Roke, also
known as the Isle of the Wise.  The island is isolated in the middle of
the Inmost Sea in the Earthsea Archipelago.  The entire island of Roke
is a part of the school's grounds and protected by Roke magic.  The guild
can, at its discretion, barr certain individuals from setting foot on the
island magically.  The school is led by the Archmage of Earthsea and a
council of the Nine Masters of Roke (Windkey, Hand, Herbal, Chanter,
Changer, Summoner, Namer, Patterner, and Doorkeeper).  Most decisions 
regarding the guild are made by the Archmage.  One notable exception is
the acceptance of new apprentices, which is handled by Master Doorkeeper.
Critical decisions require the full council in which the Archmage has
no vote.  The Archmage may only accept or veto a decision by the council.
To overturn an Archmage's veto, a majority + one Masters must vote for such 
an overturn.  Decisions that require full council include but not
limited to selecting a new Archmage or Master of Roke and declaring war on
another guild.  An Archmage can be deposed by the Masters of Roke using 
the same process as overturning a veto.  A Master can also be removed with 
a majority + one vote for removal.  Masters that have been idle for more
than 60 days may be removed by the Archmage.  Archmages idle more than 60
days will automatically be removed.  There must be at least two mortal 
Masters of Roke (Doorkeeper and Windkey) and a maximum of nine, the spots
not occupied will be taken by NPCs with names from the books.  It is
also recommended that a mortal named as Master Chanter be a member of the 
Minstrels guild and Master Herbal be a member of the Gardeners guild.

*****Membership*****

The guild is divided into three levels, apprentice, sorcerer, and mage.
All races and sexes may join the guild, but are required to maintain
blessed and above alignment.  Even though the books specifically
disallowed women, this is not compatible with Genesis.  Once Master 
Doorkeeper approves the application, a prospective member may apprentice 
under a full mage to learn the arts of the guild.  No offensive spells are 
taught to apprentices.  However, 100 levels of SS_TRUESPEECH will be 
available.  After doing tasks assigned, learning enough of SS_TRUESPEECH,
and deemed ready by his/her master and the Archmage, the apprentice may 
become a sorcerer and start learning the high art of Roke, which include 
offensive spells.  After completing a major task assigned by the Archmage 
and earning enough guild experience, a sorcerer may become a full mage.  
A full mage may acquire all arts taught by the guild and be selected to 
serve as Archmage or a Master of Roke in addition to being able to take 
an apprentice under their wing.  For role playing purposes apprentices 
are encouraged to join a layman craft guild such as Smiths, Gardeners, 
and Minstrels.  In the future, spells and perks may be added to benefit 
Smiths (enchanting weapons and armour they make), Gardeners (private herb 
garden on Roke), and Minstrels (amplifying the effects of the Songs of 
Power).  For now, additional benefits are not provided.

*****Spells, Abilities, and Special Perks*****

The Wizards of Roke ability wise as realized in Genesis are pure mages 
that focus primarily on the element air and secondarily on water.  All
forms except enchantment are trained, though the number of total levels
an individual can train is limited to 2 * SS_WIS levels.  How those
levels are distributed is up to the player but limited by the maximum 
level of each individual skill is trained in the guild.

The guild does not train any combat skills beyond what is available
freely in adventurer guilds.  For levels 3 and 4 spells the caster must
wield a blunt polearm (e.g. staff) in order to yield full effectiveness.
Wearing more than 15 kg of armour will also reduce the success rate of
casting spells.  Wearing more than 30 kg of armour will make casting
spells impossible.  Spell casting abilities are severely limited when
the caster is intoxicated.  Also no healing magic is trained.  Guild
members may not join a layman magic using guild, the sole exception 
currently in the game is Minstrels.

Roke wizards and apprentices will have free passage on ships that sail
in Earthsea.  They can also summon magewind to speed any ship along to
its destination faster.  Wizards that complete a quest and buy all the
necessary materials can commission a personal magically enchanted boat
that can sail them and their companions to any pier within Genesis.
The Immanent Grove on Roke, available to guild members only, regenerate
mana at four times the normal rate when one meditates in it.
