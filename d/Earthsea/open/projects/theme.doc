'As long ago as forever, as far away as Selidor...'
The timeline in Earthsea is not necessarily linear,
although the setting is taken from the fourth book:
a lot has already happened, more is to come, and some
events such as Karg raids, the struggle between good and
evil, life and death, happen over and over again.
The clock in Earthsea is thus not a linear clock marking years,
days, hours, seconds, but is the clock of the tides, ever
returning to the source, ever repeating in rhythmic cycles of death and
life.

Earthsea is not a continent, but rather a gathering of
islands in the sea, the Archipelago. It is a bronze-age,
flatworld culture, and perhaps you expect the world to balance
on the back of a dragon (instead of a tortoise).
 
Dragons figure largely in the myths of Earthsea, not as Krynn or
Tolkien type of dragons, but great timeless, semi-mythical creatures,
both wise and legendary. They are the source of the True Language,
the Language of the Making, the language of creation and magic.
Drawing from some elements in the fourth book of the series
there will be a greater exploration of the relationship between
dragons and humans, which were once one race. Some separated
off to become a race with "human mind and dragon heart," the
wingless ones. This is the basic symbol for the Order of
the Dragon, which will become the reborn Kaheda. 

The Order of the Dragon is a martial arts 'clan' which
remembers in a semi-mystical and symbolic way the kinship 
between humans and dragons. They draw upon their dual nature
for focus of strength and seek to find the sense of 'wholeness'
via a meditative sort of life.


Earthsea future projects: 

Development of an interdomain 'deep' sea area. Development of
the islands of Pendor, Selidor, and Havnor. Further development
of Oranea, the site of the new 'Kaheda.' 

Current guild projects: resetting Kaheda on the island of Oranea in
Earthsea, unarmed fighters.

Future guild projects: pirates' guild (sea battles), Wizards of Roke, and
a witches' coven.
