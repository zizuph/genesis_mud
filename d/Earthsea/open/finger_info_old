'As long ago as forever, as far away as Selidor...'
The timeline in Earthsea is not necessarily linear,
although the setting is taken from the fourth book of
the Ursula K. Leguin Earthsea series. A lot has happened, more
is to come, and some events such as Karg raids, the struggle
between good and evil, life and death, recur over and over.
Earthsea projects (see also /d/Earthsea/open/projects/theme.doc):
Development of an interdomain 'deep' sea area. Development of
the islands of Pendor, Selidor, and Havnor. Further development
of Oranea, the site of the new 'Kaheda.'
