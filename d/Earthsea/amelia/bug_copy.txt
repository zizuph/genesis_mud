I received a message from someone who I didn't have remembered.
I couldn't send to them using their name, so I did "send reply".
It seemed to work, but I got the messenger back saying that
it couldn't find Peridot (which is me).

Should be able to 'exa symbol' here

Shouldn't all the herbs have wizinfo on them?

There should be a message when you ente the tree.

actually, there's something wrong with enter.
When it fails, it doesn't give "What?"

There should be items for the bushes and briars.

"cut foot from corpse" should be a valid command

why does the "west pier" go east?
