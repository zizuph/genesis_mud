DOCS:
-----
docs/FAQ.txt - this file
docs/Haradrim_Military_Ranking.txt - explains the titles for the Haradrim
docs/Map.o - show the map of the area
docs/Measure_quest.txt - outlines the quest for the area


ARM/WEP:
--------
The armours and weapons are inspired from mideveal time, the seax for instance
a saxon sword (and or dagger) from 800-now. 
The weapons have neat descriptions when fighting.
Quite some time have been put into the descriptions in hopes of attracting 
players to use the items eventhough they are not magical and high end eq.
Hopefully they will become a 'base' equipment thing to be found in almost 
any weapon rack of the various guilds out there in the realm.
