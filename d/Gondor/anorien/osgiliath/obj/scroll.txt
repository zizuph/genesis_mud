             Yule, 2914 - Osgiliath.

      Everything usable has been removed from this library, and placed
in the Great Library in Minas Tirith. 
      The vault is probably emptied as well, to our knowledge, though
the key was lost last year. 


              Beruthiel,
                  Mistress of the Osgiliath Library.
