Steed tutorial, Fysix@Genesis, September 1997 
---------------------------------------------

The basic object to inherit to build a steed is steed.c. You can already
make a decent steed, like a wulf or a horse by just using this object.

Interesting functions may be:

Create the steed:
  void create_steed();

Set the maximum number of riders the steed can have:
  void set_max_riders(int i);
Important!: if the steed can carry more than 1 rider, all other riders
will follow everywhere to whereever the first rider goes. This might
raise some problems. Steeds however cannot go to places that have the
ROOM_I_NO_ALLOW_STEED property set by standard. Places where players
are not supposed to come on a steed will use this property.
So be sure your steed makes use of this property!

Check who can mount, dismount and lead the steed:
  int can_mount(object player);
  int can_dismount(object player);
  int can_lead(object player);

Set the places where the steed can go and can't go,
Don't use huge arrays of properties, since each property will checked before
the steed is moved to a new destination:
Valid and invalid destinations when steed as riders:
  void set_valid_dest(mixed property_array);
  void set_invalid_dest(mixed property_array);
Invalid destinations when steed has no riders:
  void set_invalid_unmounted_dest(mixed property_array);

Who are riding the steed, and who is driving it?
  object *query_riders();
  object query_driver();

(Dis)allow mounted combat:
  void allow_mounted_combat(int allow);

Set the food which the steed can eat:
  void set_allowed_food(mixed array_of_food_names);

Have your own shadow for riding around (your shadow must inherit
the normal steed shadow though):
  void set_steed_shadow(string your_shadow_file_name);
