04_egg

This game is an egg throwing game, with Gondor as game ground.
(Leaving Gondor is disqualification). The objective is obviously 
to be the last one in the running.

It can be played team versus team or in individual mode. The more 
hits the better the hit chance becomes. Hitting non-participating 
mortals or team members results in negative consequences. Also hits
may be rewarded with specific items that help the player during the
egg fight. This to motivate players to fight instead of hide away. 
Some random backfiring can be introduced as well with rotten eggs.

More details will follow. 
Rewarded experience depends on setup.
