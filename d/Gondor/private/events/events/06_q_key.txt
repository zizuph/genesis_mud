A known npc (Amaron/Mablung for rangers, Morandir for mages, some 
other npc outside guild) claims that his important key (officers 
room for rangers) has been stolen by some thief. He gives hints
about the looks of the thief. Players go look for thief, and get
the key back. Both key-loser and key-thief are wizard controlled.

Upto 3000 quest exp per person in team that claims the key back.
