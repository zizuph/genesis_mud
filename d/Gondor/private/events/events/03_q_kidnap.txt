A kidnapping quest.

A note is delivered to a player in a team.

In Gondor, in the case of a good aligned player:

The note comes from Steward Denethor II. He seeks help in 
solving the kidnapping of his niece. A suspicious looking
individual (wizard controlled) is found who in exchange 
for specific items betrays his mates and points the team to 
the location of the kidnapped niece. With a dress, and some 
sleeping potion and a lot of convincing the guards can be 
put to sleep and the lady rescued.

A similar quest for evil players starts with a note from the
Warden in the Black Tower who wishes to recover the captured 
Captain of the Guards in Minas Morgul.

This quest can give upto 10K of quest experience per participant,
depending on their role in the quest.
