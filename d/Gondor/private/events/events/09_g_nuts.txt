09_g_nuts GAME

10 types of gondorian nuts/fruits to be made into trail mix.
Every player gets a no-drop no-steal nutcase which grows as more 
mix is formed. Mix ingredients can be found all over Gondor.

Winner is the one with all 10 types of ingredients and most mix.
(This will make them trade but not easily give away ingredients).
Two runner ups.
(Or winner is first one getting 10 different types).
(Runner up could then be the person with most mix at the time the winner
wins).

%As an empty wooden nutcase plunks down in your hands, a voice seems to
whisper in your ear: Please aid us in our task!
%This wooden nutcase smells vaguely of nuts and dried fruit. It appears to be
made for holding trailmix!
Please aid in our quest to make the vengeful wraith, Stern Urya-Yare, into a
vegetarian and save the elves of Gondor! Fill this nutcase with at LEAST one of
each ten different gondorian trailmix ingredients, and after the span of one
hour, the biggest nutcase wins!
