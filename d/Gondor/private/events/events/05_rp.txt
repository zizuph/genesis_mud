05_rp

From all types of experiments in our trial this one is the 
-least objective (and thus most easily abused unfortunately)
-least time to prepare for wizard
-most RP promoting.

It is more or less free roleplay.
An npc is made or a existing npc is used.
The npc is controlled fully and the wizard roleplays 
in the mortal world, with a theme in mind, but not a
specific outcome or quest solving. Excellent mortal
RP gets rewarded (with interesting items or general exp).

This obviously is meant to truly promote RP.
