01_find

This is a scavenger hunt game. 

An example would be that a  (marginally) wizard controlled 
npc requests at least four players to engage, and asks for 
"something rusty, something green, something with gold but 
not a coin,  and something polished".  Much effort was put 
into making the npc look natural and uncontrolled.
