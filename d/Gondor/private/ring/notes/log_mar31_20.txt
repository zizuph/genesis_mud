Varian yells: then QUEST
nod
Varian yells: okay... so... you good at taking notes while we chat/
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian grins evilly.
Varian yells: good
You say: i'll log it all and clean it up later. :)
> 
Varian yells: so... as I see this... we probably need to look at the 'good' version first
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: we need to make it resemble, in one fashion or another, the quest of the book
Varian yells: but with variable parts
Varian yells: to make it functional for Genesis
You say: andd I don't think we need to follow the timeline exactly.
> nod

Varian yells: I think we throw the timeline out
You nod solemnly.
You hold your thumb upwards.
> 
Varian yells: So... the first step is finding a ring
Varian yells: I think this should be reasonably simple to outline...
'
What do you wish to say?
> 
Varian yells: there are lesser rings going into the game
Varian yells: there is at least one copy of the scroll of isildur
Varian yells: also going in
Varian yells: and there are many fires
You say: yes. perhaps frodo has been insured somewhere and needs a player to take it and do with as necessary.
> 
Varian ponders the situation.
Varian yells: do you want to read my "QUEST" file?
Varian yells: I suggested throwing the idea of Frodo out
You say: say. he's started leaving hobbiton and gets injured oromething?
> 
Varian ponders the situation.
You say: ok. tht works, too.
> 
Varian yells: Are we on the same page?
You say: i read it a long time ago.
> 
Varian tries to look thoughtful but fails.
Varian yells: okay...
Varian yells: Well... this would be the basic theory
Varian yells: Frodo found a ring
Varian yells: from Gollum
Varian yells: via Bilbo
Varian yells: I guess he didn't find it.... he inherited it... but you know what I meant
Varian yells: Gandalf tests it
Varian yells: and determines it to be the One Ring
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: Gandalf read the Scroll of Isildur so he knew how to test it
You say: how abt taking it all the way back to gollum? You have to go to the gobbo cves and find the ring?
> 
Varian yells: So... this is where Genesis might diverge
Varian yells: There are lesser rings... several of them
nod
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: Gandalf thought that was what Bilbo's ring was
Varian yells: had it really been a lesser ring, throwing it in the fire would have destroyed it
Varian yells: so... we have lesser rings...
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: if you test them
Varian yells: they either get destroyed, or, they have a chance at being the One Ring
Varian yells: if you have a copy of the Scroll of Isildur on you
Varian yells: the chance of it being the One Ring is higher
You say: so, recap ...
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: Frodo only had the potential of the One Ring (by Genesis standards), his was the story of a test being successful
You say: you have to find the  scroll of isuldur first, find the ring nd test it. if it's a lesser ring, it's destroyed, if it's the 1R, it works...
> 
Varian yells: and the quest can start
Varian yells: yes
agree
You agree wholeheartedly.
You say: that could be the first part of the quest.
> 
Varian yells: So... the ring in Cair Andros...
Varian yells: could have been washed down the Anduin for centuries, until a soldier found it
You say: yep.
You say: and for our purposes, it may be the 1R
> 
Varian yells: a ring in the Barrow Downs could have been left there by someone who found the ring, but lost their way in the downs
You agree wholeheartedly.
> 
Varian yells: after finding it in the Anduin
Varian yells: we could even hide a lesser ring in Bag End
You grin wickedly.
> 
Varian yells: and someone evil could kill Frodo
Varian yells: we could put one in Moria
Varian gestures vaguely.
Varian yells: we can create a backstory for each of them if we wanted
You say: one down in harad by the river.
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: Anyways...
Varian yells: that's the start of the quest...
Varian yells: the first part completed
You grin happily.
> 
Varian yells: that is fairly straightforward I think
Varian yells: the next major event in the books is the White Council
Varian yells: and meeting Elrond
Varian yells: fair to say?
You say: sure.
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: Let's not say major event... but the next 'achievement'
Varian yells: got chased by baddies
grin
You grin merrily.
> 
Varian yells: that's where we found solace and completed a stage
You say: or next step. :)
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: But... that's very predictable
Varian yells: So... finding Elrond should be only one option
Varian yells: Imladris is also west of the mountains
You say: or finding galadriel? once you find the npc, you ask for help/call a council...
> 
Varian yells: I think Galadriel is the third stage

You say: ok.
> 
Varian yells: So... Elrond would be one place
Varian yells: the Gap of Rohan might be another
Varian yells: oh...
Varian yells: wait...
Varian tries to look thoughtful but fails.
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: okay... how about this...
Varian yells: Yes, Elrond is the destination
Varian yells: but you need to find a path over the mountains
You grin.
> 
Varian yells: we have Moria, the High Pass and the Gap of Rohan
Varian yells: All will be guarded
Varian yells: but two of them will be guarded by ringwraiths
Varian yells: and are essentially unpassable
You say: th high pass and the gap? Moria can be made mor dangerous.
> 
Varian yells: one, chosen randomly, will be guarded by other baddies
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: it would encourage the ring bearer to assemble a team
Varian yells: to fight through the one area
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: we would have to make special code for these battles
Varian yells: since they can only appear with the ring near
You say: you've thought this thru.
> 
Varian yells: so... once we are east of the mountains...
Varian yells: we are moving towards the third stage
Varian yells: finding guidance with Galadriel
Varian yells: a second option could easily be Thranduil in Mirkwood
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: also Radagast
Varian yells: who lives on the edge of MIrkwood
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: there... the bearer is given guidance and a gift
Varian yells: to help them in MOrdor
Varian yells: then we move to the fourth stage
Varian yells: which is to learn a secret entrance
Varian yells: the Faramir stage
You say: maybe for entering mordor, there are a couple other secret passages over the mountain.
> 
Varian yells: it could be Faramir... it could be Eomer...
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: and again... like with the first stage
Varian yells: there are enemies blocking two of the three entrances
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: cirith ungol being one of them
Varian yells: from there...
Varian ponders the situation.
Varian yells: do we re-create the rescue of Frodo by Sam?

You say: i'd say no. let the cirith ungol be 1 option, and have a couple other tough options to cross into mordor.
> 
Varian yells: yes... but should the quest require a companion?
Varian tries to look thoughtful but fails.
You say: oh, I see.
> 
Varian yells: So... Shelob might be in Cirith Ungol
You say: it should, i think.
> 
Varian yells: but, other similar dangers could guard the other entrances
Varian yells: The ring draws them... the bearer is incapacitated
Varian yells: and the companion needs to solo-rescue
> 
Varian yells: this gets us directly to Barad-Dur (Lugburz)
You say: or make the solo rescue random.
> 
Varian yells: well... that's stuff to debate in a meeting
Varian grins evilly.
Varian yells: from there
You say: if you don't bring a companion, you will need one. :)
> 
Varian yells: we have the sneaking from Barad-Dur to Orodruin
Varian yells: need to dress up, possibly fight otherwise
Varian yells: get to the mountain
Varian yells: in absence of a Gollum
> 
Varian yells: which we won't have
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: maybe they would need to use the gift from Galadriel/Thranduil/Radagast
Varian yells: so overcome the strength of the ring
Varian yells: and destroy it
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: otherwise, like happened with Frodo... they choose not to destroy the ring
Varian grins evilly.
You say: or it calls the ringwraiths to them.
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: failure of some sort
nod
Varian yells: okay... for a 'good' version of the quest
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: does this seem reasonable?
Varian yells: as a skeleton
Varian yells: we have several stages
You say: totally reasonable.
> 
Varian yells: 1: find the ring
Varian yells: 2: find direction
Varian yells: 3: find guidance/gift
Varian yells: 4: find secret passage info
Varian yells: 5: travel from barad-dur to orodruin and destroy ring
You nod.
> 
Varian yells: each will have their own obstacles
Varian yells: but... a five stage quest... seems about right
Varian yells: with danger in most of the stages
once the ring is destroyed, they get to run amok in mordor and the tower, but can't entr the mage's guild.
You agree wholeheartedly.
> 
Varian yells: okay...
You say: once the ring is destroyed, they get to run amok in mordor and the tower, but can't entr the mage's guild.
> 
Varian grins evilly.
Varian yells: Now... the evil version
You grin merrily.
> 
Varian yells: I am stuck on one thing
You say: that's the hard one, i think.
> 
Varian yells: if they discover the ring... we need to take it away from them
You say: how would we take it away from them?
> 
Varian yells: codewise? very easily
Varian grins evilly.
Varian yells: but... let's say they test the ring...
Varian yells: there isn't anything evil in Mordor trying to stop them
You agree wholeheartedly.
> 
Varian yells: if they wanted to take it to Sauron
Varian yells: so...
Varian yells: we need to remove the ring from them somehow
Hmmmm.
> 
Varian yells: Make gandalf appear, stun them as he takes the ring away?
Varian yells: I don't know
Varian yells: it's the major issue I have
You say: yeah...
> 
Varian yells: But... it still gives us a first stage
You say: how could we work saruman into it? Hes after te ring, too.
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: I have thoughts for that
Varian yells: but I think we would need to work the quest in reverse
You say: somewhere along the way, you get ambushed by his orcs and they take it from you?
> 
Varian yells: well... I think the One Ring needs to go to Imladris
Varian yells: and getting there will be the difficulty
You say: why, if it's an evil doing thr uest?
> 
Varian yells: well... the ring was stolen... they have to go get it
Varian yells: once they have it... going to Mordor has no barriers for someone evil
Varian yells: but the Rohirrim could guard the gap of Rohan... Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain could have gone and foritfied Moria (restablishing Balin's realm)
Varian yells: the elves of Mirkwood could hold the High Pass
Varian yells: right?
Varian yells: Gives danger the other way
You say: unless ... Once the ring is found, Sauron sends out his minions to get it from the player, and you have to fight those minions or evade them.
> 
Varian yells: doesn't work... we have MM as a guild
Varian yells: it might work for other evils... but not them
Varian yells: that's why I say we need to remove the ring from them...
Varian yells: maybe.... maybe....
Varian yells: if an evil tests the ring
Varian yells: it ALWAYS fails
You grin.
> 
Varian yells: but, sometimes a One Ring is generated, and 'word comes' from a messenger
Varian yells: so the ring they tested failed
Varian yells: but, a messenger tells them that the One was found somewhere in the northwest of Middle-Earth
Varian yells: they are still generating a ring... just not in their inventory
Varian yells: anyways...
clone You say: ok.
> 
Varian yells: they need to find a secret passage into Rivendell, they need a gift that gets them past the guard magic of the Bruinen
Varian yells: and they need to fight at the Gap/Moria/High Pass
You say: i'm thinking we assume the ringwraiths are the top leaders next to sauron. let's make them less than that and have higher ups above the ringwraiths., like the mouth of sauron.
> 
Varian yells: the Mouth isn't above them
You say: we can have others above them who also want the ring to present to sauron.
> 
Varian yells: But... there isn't anyone above the Ringwraiths
You say: says who?
> 
Varian tries to look thoughtful but fails.
Varian yells: Tolkien
You say: we cn still have bands of npcs who want to take it from them.
> 
Varian yells: It removes all stages for the quest
Varian yells: so... lets take a worst-case scenario
You say: i still don't see why they'd seek help from rivendell, or any of the goodies.
> 
Varian yells: a player Nazgul tests the ring in a fire in Minas Morgul
Varian yells: they aren't seeking help
Varian yells: they are going to pillage and forcibly take the ring
Varian yells: how to you build in stages of a quest to block a player Nazgul between Minas Morgul and Barad-Dur?
You say: but the ring of elrond protected rivendell.
> 
Varian yells: it hid Rivendell
Varian yells: just as Galadriel's ring hid Lorien
Varian yells: from the attention of Sauron
You say: but they knew the places were there, oyhrtewise the nazgul would have bbeen able to cross the river when chasing frodo.
> 
Varian yells: but it wasn't Vilya that activated the Bruinen
Varian yells: Vilya was the Ring of Air/Sky
You say: anyhow ...
> 
Varian nods.
Varian yells: So instead of taking the ring with you somewhere... an evil would have to go take the ring from elsewhere
You say: this may be where we need the meeting for ideas,
Varian nods.
Varian yells: and saruman could be the 'neutral'
Varian yells: solution
You nod solemnly.
> 
Varian yells: gonna be afk for 10 mins for work
You say: maybe make him the one where the players have to get the ring from to deliver it to sauron.
You say: oh, have one of saruman's uruk have the ring, and they have to get it before they uruk gets back to saurman who would wear the ring and become the next sauron?
