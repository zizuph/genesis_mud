Hi ranger councillors,

It seems a few personnel have changed since my initial discussions about a
ranger recode. I am forwarding my original thoughts to you so you are aware of
discussions that have been had so far.

I look forward to working with you all in the new year to bring the rangers in
to the standardised special and spell system, and improving the playability of
the guild with your help!

Cheers,
A.K
