I had some follow up questsions, so I invited Goldbezie up.

In short, spells can go. Trade with potions and additional damage in brawl. She
likes to be sneaky but would sacrifice that ability for more damage if need be.

A quicker recode could involve replacing spells with potions. Adding more
damage to brawl, with a higher chance of it going off. Drop the blindness
frequency, allowing for more knee's, etc. This will raise tax, but with the
removal of spells, it should work.

So,  a strong potion making fighter guild with sneak ability.

I'll draft up a proposal including tax changes to see how it will all work. We
currently tax 21-22% depending on which company they are in.


Tomas.
