Some thoughts on Ranger Recode stealth attack

I like the idea of damage mitigation more and more as the stealth special. I've
been thinking a little tonight, and what about something like this:

RoI
*****
Reduced damage, like Neidar or SOHM/WOHS stone skin
In my experience reduction is better than avoidance, so this is the strongest
of the three for combat purposes.

RoN
*****
Avoid damage like pirate swagger or angmar shield
I feel like dancing around and avoiding hits compliments the sneakiest branch

RoG
*****
Small stun
Stunning an opponent is a great start to battle, but likely this would be a
small stun/trip special.

We could mix it up by allowing any two rangers to combine their abilities. So
if a ROI and a RON were teamed, the one in front could get a strong version of
their special and a weaker version of their teammates. For example, ROI
initiates the attack and RON assists, so we have strong damage reduction and
medium dodge.

Furthermore, there could be a reduced add if aiding a teammate. So a ROI
teaming with a knight could help the knight mitigate some damage. Now we have a
support role for our Rangers in a team. I would think this could work in line
with Angmar having the shield special but still getting an offensive special.

One possibility for balance is that this works only against single opponents.
Or possibly only against single opponents unless rangers are teamed.
