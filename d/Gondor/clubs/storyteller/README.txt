README

All directories in this path are for the Storytellers club. Please
do not put unrelated files in this directory, and please ensure that
all club files are kept here.

Credit for this club is hard to place. It appears that Lord Elessar
Telcontar originally began work on it some five years before it was
completed. Other noteworth contributors are the wizards Gnadnar,
Opus and Sheehan, as well as the mortal Iliana, who seems to have
provided much of the content.

Important files include:
~/obj/telsoul.c			(the soul)
~/obj/storybook.c		(the guild item and story book)

~/misc/tellers.c		(the administrative object)
~/misc/teller_save.o		(the save file for the administrative object)

~/rooms/archives.c		(the library which contains all stories)
~/stories/stories.o		(the library save object)

~/tellers/*.o			(the individual save files for the tellers)

Membership to the club is not hard to come by. It requires only a
minimum level of intelligence and wisdom, as well as a skill with
language. Membership for goblins is somewhat harder to come by, as
they are an unintelligent race and should be treated accordingly. If
a player meets these requirements, he may join or leave at any time
with no penalty. Any member may write new stories, copy any existant
stories into their story book, and remove or edit their own stories.

Librarians may, in addition to the abilities of a normal member, edit
or remove the stories of others. They are also the only members who 
may approve stories and move them from the desk to the shelves for
permanent storage. Librarians must be appointed by a wizard of Gondor
or an Archwizard or Keeper.

To make appointments or manage the club, go to 

/d/Gondor/clubs/storyteller/rooms/archives

and read the poster for the commands available.
