Hi Eowul,

I placed an updated version of the rangers addendum under
/d/Gondor/info/GUILD/..

Below I have added my responses to your comments. 

In addition, I added .5 to the tax for the RoN for their
stealth cloak. The file for this exists under
/d/Gondor/guilds/rangers/obj/cloak_base.c. I also added
this to the docs. Let me know if that assessment is ok.
It is for RoN only.

Please let me know if there is anything else that needs
tweaking or if there are any other issues.

Thank you very much for your time. :)

Hey Tigerlily,

Comments thus far on the skill part of your document.

- Apprentice skills calculation is correct.

- The total number of taxable slots in the RoI is 570 where for occupational
  guilds a maximum of 550 is allowed. 
  ** My typo, for defense should have been 55, instead of 75 (75-20)--
     I corrected this and it totals to 550.

- I am not completely sure about the tax also being payed over the 105 
  slots the primary weapon skill uses instead of just over 60 (the 105 is
  as far as I know primarly to for the 550 tax limit) but I will check 
  this with Mrpr and Mercade.
  **For now I left the tax for additional slots in the doc, until
    a decision is made.

- You also mention the .6% tax for the weapon choice, why was this done, 
  and what are the three weapon choices?
  **Per your suggestion, I removed the additional tax for weapon choice,
    since the choice is mutually exclusive. The choices are thus: for RoN
    choice between bow and sword. For RoI choice between sword and
    polearm. If a selection is made, the alternate weapon can't be 
    trained above Adv. Guild levels. So depending on which company 
    the player is in, they can train up one weapon skill. 

- Awareness is a general skill and as such does not need the 4x modifier
  on taxable slots (for the RoN)
  ** I corrected the slots computation for RoN awareness and added
     5 levels each to the magic skills abjuration, life spells, and
     conjuration (15 levels).

- Perhaps you want to use those few extra slots of offer some parry to
  the North company? 
  ** For these very few slots I think it is best spent on magic. Hopefully,
     the level of defense will give them what they need for defensive
     skills.
    **Correction May, 2004: extra 15 levels spent on additional 5 levels of
          awareness, sneak, and hide, not magic. 

- For the primary weapon skill of the RoN you use (75-30)+5*4 as calculator
  for the slots where you actually train 80 levels, so the formula would be
  (80-30)+(5*4) which results in 70 taxable slots instead of 65.

  ** Actually I think this calculation is correct, per man guilds3:

    "So if a occupational ranger guild offers 90 levels of SS_WEP_SWORD
     they would have to give up ((75 - 30) + (15 * 4)) 105 taxable skill
     slots."  

     Hence for RoI with 90 for sword or polearm, the formula 
     is (75-30) + ((90-75) * 4) = 105 slots, and for RoN
     it is (75-30) + ((80-75) * 4) = 65 slots, with the additional levels
     over 75 calculated with the 4 multiplier. 
    

Hopefully I will be able to give you the answer on the extra tax for the
primary weapon soon.

** Per your suggestion and comparing it to the merc tax computations,
    I removed the additional tax for weapon choice.
