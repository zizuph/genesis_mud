Calians: presently no check against swarm possible

Solamnian Knights:

The note is titled 'About the Knight's Bash and Ckick (Elessar, Feb  4)':

Hi!
I am working on a few special monsters right now, and I want them
to take less damage from the Solamnic Knights ckick and bash than
a normal monster would do. Is there any hope for a property to set,
or any other simple way of doing this?
These are undead, magically protected creatures, who can
only be hurt with special magical weapons, and although the
Knights doubtless are strong and all that, I don't want normal
hitting to do any damage.

hit_me() - The function is no longer nomask. So you can redefine it in your
           mobiles (ghosts) and test if you will allow the attack a true hit.
           All attacks not generated from weapons (all special one's) should
           have the forth argument, att_id, set to -1. If the att_id is set
           you can use it to see if a weapon is there, and then check the
           weapon to see if it's one that you allow to hit this mobile. If
           you set the damage type to MAGIC_DT (wa_types.h) then no armour
           will help against this type of attack. (Typically attack spells).
