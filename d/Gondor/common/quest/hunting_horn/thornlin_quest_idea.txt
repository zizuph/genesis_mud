---===> Required Quest (Idea) For Opening Of My Apr. Project <===---
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hail Gondor!

    Greetings, I'll first explain about the village then the quest
    idea.

    The village name is Thornlin and is located in Lossarnach, in
    Gondor (how strange *smile*), the name Thornlin shouldn't be
    mentioned in any of Tolkiens books as I made it up :-)
    It will contain about 22-25 rooms where 1/3 will be roads,
    1/3 houses and 1/3 fields.
    I will stribe that this area is only protected by NPC's
    and if a knight/squire rescues (a skill often used to start
    player fights) one of the men in the village set to protect it,
    he will then turn to attack the knight since he is also making
    trouble in the village the same will happen if a player assists
    the man. This should keep players start fights in the protective
    spirit.

    The quest :
    The player should go to hunthor and get the task, to find a hunting
    horn for him, and that he want one of the great hunting horns.
    The player shall then travel to Lossanach(Thornlin) and find a ox and
    then basicly follow theese instructions.
    - Don't just 'kill (ox)' it, since that would ruin the horns
    - Find the owner of the ox, ask him to allow you butcher the ox
    - Get him to teach you about butchering
    - Find out what you need of tools.
    - Find a hammer and a knife (You will know them when you find them
                                 the description will tell you that its
                                 butchering tools.)
    - Go back to the farmer
    - Learn (the syntax) how to hit the ox with a hammer
    - Learn how to cut the throat on the ox
    - Find the ox and walk up to it
    - Hit the ox and cut the throat - skill/stat check :
      Animal_handling - lvl. 10 - ??
      Club - lvl 15 - ??
      knife - lvl 10 - ??
      DIS  - Normal for starting the fight + 5
      STR  - Ox's CON + 5
      -----Unarmed combat
      Unarmed_C - level 25 - ?? (no club needed)
      STR - Ox's CON + 15

    - Get the hunting horns from the corpse
    - Tell the farmer that your done
    - Return to Hunthor and deliver the hunting horns
    - You only need one horn to do the quest, but if you deliver
      two could there then be a reward for the second like a free
      meal or a drink with Hunthor or something ?

    And get the xp.

    One question I would like my quests syntaxs (answers) to be abit
    random is that allowed ? like 3,4 or 5 different options only one
    will work at each re(boot/set) (maybe more) couldn't find any rules
    against it.

            Greetings,
                ^Sir Boromir
