Hail Melkor!

My greetings yet again, Lord Tainawath.

I submit to you below a suggestion for the roof of
the Tower.  This has been reviewed by the
other Ringbearers and found suitable for your
inspection as well.  I stand ready to assist
further if you so desire.

In eternal service of the Master,
Thawa-Er

===================
Tower Description Below
===================

Short Description:  
The Morgul Beastiary

Long Description:
The roof of the Tower opens to the ever black skies of Mordor.  The floor 
upon which you stand high atop the Black Tower appears to be constructed of 
a single sheet of black obsidian.  The minimal light that makes it through the 
ever-present clouds swirling about the pinnacle of the Tower appears to be 
drawn into the stone and dissipated in its inky depths. At the far end of the 
roof several posts of the same obsidian material jut up from the stone that 
makes up the floor.  Looking into the distance from the roof, you cannot help 
but exalt in the power of the Dark Lord that brought this Tower into existence 
in generations past.

add item: floor, stone, roof							[[ DONE ]]

Upon first glance, the floor's ebony black surface appears to be completely 
unmarred. However, upon closer inspection, fine grooves are barely perceptible 
under the scrutiny of your gaze.  The single sheet of obsidian extends to 
the edge of the roof where it ends suddenly in a sheer drop off to the ground 
far below.

add item: ground										[[ DONE ]]

As you step fearlessly to the edge of the roof, you glance downward and see 
only the swirling mists surrounding the Tower's lower parapets.

add item: mists											[[ DONE ]]

The dark mists move with the winds gusting about the Tower, but never seem 
to thin out as they snake their way around the Tower.  The inky blackness 
they cast is nearly suffocating, yet you feel quite comfortable as they 
swirl violently about you.

add item: parapets, lower parapets, tower, Tower		[[ DONE ]]

Wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, 
mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant.  You stand upon the 
culmination of centuries of work that only the Black Master could have 
orchestrated.  The sense of power emanating from this perch seemingly 
atop the world is invigorating beyond description.

add item: grooves, furrows								[[ DONE ]]

As you bend down to examine the grooves more carefully, you quickly conclude 
that the furrows in the floor must have been made by the rending of the claws 
of the Nazgul beasts that regularly alight here.

add item:  post, posts, obsidian post, obsidian posts	[[ DONE ]]

Upon closer inspection, it is clear that these posts are used to tether the 
massive winged beasts of the Nazgul to the roof when not in use.  You also 
notice several deep channels that appear to be have been dug into the floor 
near these posts.

add item: channel, shallow channels						[[ DONE ]]

The black of the obsidian is tainted slightly by the copper tones of spilt 
blood.  The troughs are clearly deep enough to keep anything from easily 
escaping once deposited there by the mighty beasts.  Preferring a fresh meal, 
it appears that the beasts regularly bring back whatever prey they capture 
to the roof of the Tower to consume when not serving their Masters.  Peering 
into the depths of the channel nearest you, you sense movement.  A childlike 
form stirs almost imperceptibly from within.

add item: form, childlike form, child, child, hobbit, elf	[[ DONE ]]

From this distance, which is absolutely as close as you wish to come to the 
disgusting mess of filth within the trough, it appears as if one of the beasts 
has deposited a meal, perhaps a hobbit or elvish child, to be consumed when the
urge strikes it.
