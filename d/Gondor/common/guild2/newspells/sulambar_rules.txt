Behold the Power of the Dark Lord,

I have spent countless hours before the Dark Lord in your behalf 
regarding the outcome of the spell Sulambar. Needless to say, He is not 
pleased with the way it has been abused in the past. Therefore, He has 
altered it so that Sulambar does not fail as often as before. 
 
This has been done with the following understanding: if it is ever 
abused again, Sulambar will become more dangerous to Mages than before, 
and may even be removed all together. Failure to not record this in your 
archives will not be a valid excuse for those who follow you.

Mark well this warning, for there will never be a second chance again 
with the spell.

-- Finwe
