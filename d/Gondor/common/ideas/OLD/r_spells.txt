TODO:
Decide all spells for each Company, along with 'level', mana-cost and
difficulty. Code into guild-object for each Company with these differences,
so that the spell is only available after some predetermined point of a
Ranger's career. Examples: By guild-stat, by quests, by magic-skills etc.
The Gondor Company will be offered all these spells, while the others will
only have a selection, available at a higher level.
