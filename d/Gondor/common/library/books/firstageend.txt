                  THE END OF THE FIRST AGE

In the years that followed the Edain's arrival in Beleriand, they
befriended the Eldar. It was the Noldo King of Nargothrond, Finrod
Felagund who first of the Eldar encountered the Edain, while the
latter were making camp for the night. As Finrod played fair music on
Beor's harp, and sang about the Creation, the Men hearkened, and
Finrod taught them true knowledge. The Edain settled in Beleriand, and
lived in peace with the Eldar; these were the days of the Long Peace,
when Morgoth did not try to break the Siege of Angband, and this lasted
for almost two hundred years. During this time, another group of the
Lintador, the Druedain also entered Beleriand, but lived by themselves,
and did not meddle with the affairs of the Eldar or the Black Enemy.
Then, concluding the end of the Long Peace, Morgoth once more unleashed
his armies upon the Free Peoples, and the battles were hard and many.
Morgoth had even succeeded in seducing the Arhunedain, thereafter called
the Arhunerim, in his armies, and they also became embroiled in the
struggle. The First Age at last ended with the War of Wrath, in the Final
Battle, when a Host of the Valar overthrew Morgoth, and the earth was
changed. Except for Lindon, all of Beleriand perished beneath the Great Sea.
The Elder Days passed, and the Dark Years of the Second Age began.
