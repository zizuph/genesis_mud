Elbereth:
+++++++++

A song to praise Elbereth, the Goddess of the Stars.

        A! Elbereth, Gilthoniel,
        silivren penna miriel
        o menel aglar elenath!
        Na chaered palan-diriel
        o galadhremmin ennorath,
        Fanuilos, le linnathon
        nef aear, si nef aearon!


Eorl:
+++++

A song recalling how tall and fair was Eorl the Young.

        Where now the horse and the rider?
          Where is the horn that was blowing?
        Where is the helm and the hauberk,
          and the bright hair flowing?
        Where is the hand on the harpstring,
          and the red fire glowing?
        Where is the spring and the harvest
          and the tall corn growing?
        They have passed like rain on the mountain,
          like a wind in the meadow;
        The days have gone down in the West
          behind the hills into shadow.
        Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,
        Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?


Eressea:
++++++++

A song to the Sea and to Eressea, the Elven-home in the West.

        To the Sea, to the Sea! The white gulls are crying,
        the wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.
        West, west away, the round sun is falling.
        Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling,
        The voices of my people that have gone before me?
        I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;
        For our days are ending and our years are failing.
        I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.
        Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,
        Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,
        In Eressea, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,
        Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!


Galadriel:
++++++++++

A song of fair Lorien and the Lady Galadriel.

        In Dwimordene, in Lorien
        Seldom have walked the feet of Men,
        Few mortal eyes have seen the light
        That lies there ever, long and bright.
        Galadriel! Galadriel!
        Clear is the water of your well;
        White is the star in your white hand;
        Unmarred, unstained is leaf and land
        In Dwimordene, in Lorien
        More fair than thoughts of Mortal Men.


Gondor:
+++++++

A song to praise Gondor, your fair homeland.

        Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!
        West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree
        Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old.
        O proud walls! White towers! O winged crown and throne of gold!
        O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree,
        or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?


Parting:
++++++++

A few lines of an ancient song, attributed to Beren Erchamion.

        Farewell sweet earth and northern sky,

        for ever blest, since here did lie
        and here with lissom limbs did run
        beneath the Moon, beneath the Sun,
        Luthien Tinuviel
        more fair than mortal tongue can tell.
        Though all to ruin fell the world
        and were dissolved and backward hurled
        unmade into the old abyss,
        yet were it's making good, for this -
        the dusk, the dawn, the earth, the sea -
        that Luthien for a time should be.


Valimar:
++++++++

A song of Valimar, the land of the Valar lost in the West

        Ai! laurie lantar lassi surinen,
        Yeni unotime ve ramar aldaron!
        Yeni ve linte yuldar avanier
        mi oromardi lisse-miruvoreva
        Andune pella, Vardo tellumar
        nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni
        omaryo airetari-lirinen.
        Si man i yulma nin enquantuva?
        An si Tintalle Varda Oiolosseo
        ve fanyar maryat Elentari ortane
        ar ilye tier undulave lumbule;
        ar sindanoriello caita mornie
        i falmalinnar imbe met, ar hisie
        untupa Calaciryo miri oiale.
        Si vanwa na, Romello vanwa, Valimar!
        Namarie! Nai hiruvalye Valimar.
        Nai elye hiruva. Namarie!


Wanderer:
+++++++++

A song about the end of the journey and the joy of coming home.

        Roads go ever ever on,
          Over rock and under tree,
        By caves where never sun has shone,
          By streams that never find the sea:
        Over snow by winter sown,
          And through the merry flowers of June,
        Over grass and over stone,
          And under mountains in the moon.

        Roads go ever ever on,
          Under cloud and under star,
        Yet feet that wandering have gone,
          Turn at last to home afar.
        Eyes that fire and sword have seen
          And horror in the halls of stone
        Look at last on meadows green
          And trees and hills they long have known.
