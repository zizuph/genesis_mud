                          THE SECOND AGE

The Second Age of Middle-earth began after the Great Battle, the War of
Wrath, when the Valar cast Morgoth out of the World and into the Void,
and Beleriand was destroyed. On the new western shore of Middle-earth
only Lindon, Ossiriand of old, remained of Beleriand. Here Cirdan the
Noldo built his Grey Havens, and Gil-galad his realm of Eldar. In the Sea
west of Middle-earth the Valar raised an island which was given the name
Numenor, and it was granted to the Edain as a reward for their valour and
faithfulness in the Great Battle. For about 1000 years the Dunedain lived
in Numenor, becoming great mariners. Then, about year 1200 they established
permanent havens in Middle-earth again, aiding the primitive men to free
themselves from the Shadow of Sauron, Morgoth's servant, who had arisen, and
fortified himself in Mordor. Sauron, disguised as Annatar also seduced the
Elves of Eregion, and worked for many years with Celebrimbor, forging some
artifacts which the legends call the Rings of Power. But when the
Elves discovered the treachery in year 1693, the War of the Elves and Sauron
began. It is said that Sauron had forged a Ring of Power, with which he
led his forces through destroying Eregion, and overran Eriador. But then,
in about year 1700, the Numenoreans sent a great fleet to aid Gil-galad
in Lindon, and they defeated Saurons armies.
