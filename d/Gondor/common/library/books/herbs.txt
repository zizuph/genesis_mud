- Angurth
The leaves of this plant are used to produce addictive and dangerous drugs.
Eating the unprepared  leaves is poisonous, too.  The Angurth does not grow
naturally in  Gondor, but it is  smuggled into the  country from the south.
The possession of the leaves is illegal in Gondor.

- Athelas
A plant with long green leaves. It  has been brought to Middle Earth by the
Dunedain when they left Westernesse. It is also known as kingsfoil. It does
not grow on bare ground but prefers  thickets. When the leaves are crushed,
they give out a sweet and pungent fragrance. Kingsfoil has no known virtue,
save  perhaps  to  sweeten a  fouled  air, or to  drive  away  some passing
heaviness. In  old tales from  the days of  the Kings, it  is reported that
kingsfoil can give life to the dying, but only in the hands of the King. 

- Evendim Grass
The straw of the  evendim fields is  known for its  magic properties. It is
said that the  hobbits have used it  to improve their  abilities to dodge a
thrown stone. 

- Frostheal
A  dimunitive  creeping plant  found at  higher  elevations  than any other
plant, often growing at the very edge of eversnow. The small, grayish fuzzy
leaves will  make people who  eat them more   cold-resistant. But there are
only very  few skilled  enough in  herb lore to  discern the  leaves of the
frostheal from thos of the madwort.

- Fungiarbo
A rare  tree  mushroom.  It has  a  spungy  brownish  roof, which  is white
underneath, and has a  thin beige stem. Fungiarbo  is said to be often used
as a magical ingredient, but in Gondor it is unknown for which spells or of
what nature these spells are.

- Huckleberry
A green  berry of the  family of the  famous  Athelas, or  Kingsfoil. It is
rumoured that the  Huckleberry can be helpfull  for casting healing spells,
but nothing more is known about these properties in Gondor.

- Lianor Berry
The lianor is a tree growing on open grassy fields. The berry of the lianor
is well known for it's healing  properties. It is said that it closes small
wounds in a matter of seconds.

- Lothore
A red  heart-shaped flower. It is  known in Gondor for  its magical healing
powers.  Unfortunately the power  cannot be used except  by a secret spell.
This spell is  well-known among the  true Dunedain, and  among rangers, but
only few others know of its  existence. Eating the flower will not have any
effect.

- Madwort
A dimunitive creeping plant with  small, grayish fuzzy leaves. The plant is
growing  preferably at high  elevations. When eaten,  the leaves can dimish
the strength or even kill. Nothing else is known about this plant.

- Parsley
A green leaf known as Petroselinum  crispum, or parsley. It is an annual or
biennial herb of the  carrot family widely  cultivated for its leaves which
are  used as a  culinary  herb  or  garnish. In  the  realm of  Arnor it is
rumoured that parsley has magic properties, but nothing more is known about
these properties in Gondor.

- Pawnrose
The pawnrose is a green rose. It grows in Gondor as well as in the realm of
the old kingdom of  Arnor. Of its own it has no  known use, but it is known
to strengthen certain spells.

- Redweed 
The Redweed  is known in  Gondor for its   fatigue-restoring  magic powers.
Unfortunately power cannot be used except with the a secret spell. This
spell is  well-known among the true  Dunedain, and  among rangers, but only
few others know of its existence. Eating the weed will not have any effect.

- Ungolestel
This is a moss, brown of colour and  soft to the touch. It is known to grow
in small patches. With a spell, this moss can cure spider-poison. The spell
is said to be known among the true Men of Westernesse, and among rangers.
