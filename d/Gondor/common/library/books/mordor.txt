                                   MORDOR

Mordor, ("Black-land"), is a realm east of the lower Anduin, bounded and
protected on the north by the Ered Lithui, and on the south and west by
the Ephel Duath. It is an infertile land, its plains mostly covered by
ashes from the volcano Orodruin, also called Mount Doom by the Gondorians.
Mordor was first settled by Sauron some time in the early Second Age, and
has ever after been a stronghold of evil. Sauron directed the War against
the Elves from SA 1600-1700 from Mordor, but was beaten by the Elves and
the Numenoreans. In the end of the Second Age, Sauron again gathered his
forces in Mordor, and attacked Gondor in SA 3429. Mordor was however invaded
by the army of the Last Alliance in 3434, and in 3441, Sauron was slain, his
tower Barad-dur was all torn down, save its foundations, and Mordor was
cleansed of his servants. In the Third Age Gondor built fortresses along
Mordors borders, such as Cirith Ungol and Durthang to prevent anything
evil from reentering Mordor. However, after the Great Plague in TA 1636,
these fortresses were abandoned. In TA 2000, the Nine Ringwraiths appeared
from Mordor, and sieged and seized Minas Ithil, the capital of Ithilien, which
was situated at the border of Mordor. From TA 2901 orcs and Uruk-hai began
coming out of Mordor, ravaging Ithilien, and some time after this, possibly
in 2942, Sauron returned to Mordor, and rebuilt his forces and Barad-dur.
Then in 2951 Sauron openly declared his return, and in 2954 Mount Doom once
again burst in flame.
In Mordor can be found: Cirith Gorgor, Morannon, Cirith Ungol, Isenmouthe,
  Durthang, Barad-dur, Orodruin, Udun and Gorgoroth.
