The Rangers of the Westlands
============================

There are three companies of the Rangers of the Westlands:

The Rangers of Gondor:
----------------------
  The guildhouse of the Rangers of Gondor is hidden in the Druadan
Forest in Anorien. All rangers join the guild in this guild house.
  The Rangers of Gondor specialize in clerical skills and of all
rangers they are the most experienced in herbalism and spell casting.
It is one of the most noble aims of the Rangers of Gondor to preserve
the knowledge of ancient times and to collect all kinds of lore. The
library of the Rangers of Gondor is famed throughout the Westlands.
  The Company of the Rangers of Gondor is led by a Captain appointed
by the Chieftain.

The Rangers of Ithilien:
-----------------------
  The Rangers of Ithilien are soldiers of Gondor fighting in Ithilien.
They are descended from folk who lived in Ithilien at one time, before
it was overrun. From such men the Stewards of Gondor choose their
forayers, who cross the Anduin secretly the harry the Orcs and other
enemies that roam between the Ephel Duath and the River.
  Their secret refuge is the Henneth Annun, the Window on the West,
a large cave hidden in a hill in Northern Ithilien.
  The Rangers of Ithilien are the best fighters of all rangers, but
the continuing fight against the Enemy in Ithilien leaves them little
time to practice skills not related to combat.
  The Company of the Rangers of Ithilien is led by a Captain appointed
by the Chieftain and by Faramir, son of Denethor, Steward of Gondor.

The Rangers of the North:
------------------------
  The Rangers of the North are the most secretive of all companies.
They are the descendants of the Dunedain of Arnor. Unknown to hobbits
and men living in the Lost Realm of Arnor, the Rangers of the North
protect the lands of the former kingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur, and
Cardolan against the servants of the Enemy.
  The guildhouse of the Rangers of the North is hidden somewhere in
the north, probably close to one of the old cities of Arnor,
Annuminas and Fornost.
  The Company of the Rangers of the North is led by a Captain
appointed by the Chieftain and by Strider, who is also called Aragorn,
Arathorn's son.
  Aragorn is the direct descendant of the Kings of Arnor and
Arthedain. After the early death of his father, he grew up in Imladris
under the protection of Elrond, the Peredhil. In Imladris he was
called 'Estel', which is 'hope', as he is the hope not only of the
Rangers of the North, but of all Dunedain in Middle Earth.
