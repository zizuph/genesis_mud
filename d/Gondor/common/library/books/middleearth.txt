   |   Chapter I: Introduction                                      |
   |                                                                |
   |   Much has been written about the History of the lands on      |
   |   the continent of Middle Earth or Endor, but most of the      |
   |   writings that survive to these days were written by those    |
   |   who call themselves elf friends, and who came to Middle      |
   |   Earth out of the Great Sea in the Second Age of the Sun,     |
   |   first as conquerors, later as exiles.  In those works of     |
   |   history there is little said about any other peoples, and    |
   |   if other peoples are mentioned, they are pictured as wild    |
   |   and uncouth, with with minds bent solely on war, invasion,   |
   |   and plunder.  Since few other peoples have survived in the   |
   |   western parts of Middle Earth to these days, and even less   |
   |   written evidence remains save that of the elf friends,       |
   |   many have considered their works to depict the actual        |
   |   historical events truthfully.  Careful study though, even    |
   |   of those works, will reveal that this is not so.             |
   |                                                                |
   |   As a member of the First House of the Dunedain, in my        |
   |   youth I had ample opportunity to study works of history      |
   |   and lore as they are kept in the cities of Minas Tirith      |
   |   and Pelargir.  Using these sources and oral traditions       |
   |   of my house, I have tried to lift the layer of lies and      |
   |   half-truths and to reconstruct a reliable history of the     |
   |   lands of Middle Earth from the beginning of the First Age    |
   |   of the Sun to these days in the last years of the third      |
   |   millennium of the Third Age.                                 |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Chapter II: The First Age of the Sun                         |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Peoples of Beleriand                                     |
   |                                                                |
   |   There remain no independent sources of the history of        |
   |   Middle Earth in the First Age of the Sun.  We know that      |
   |   three Houses of Men entered Beleriand and encountered the    |
   |   elves living there.  Most parts of those three Houses were   |
   |   quickly forced into bondage to the elf lords of Beleriand,   |
   |   and those who were unwilling to endure this fate were        |
   |   driven out of Beleriand, back into Eriador.                  |
   |                                                                |
   |   It is also uncontested that in later years more men          |
   |   crossed the Ered Luin and came into Beleriand, some to       |
   |   suffer the same fate of bondage to elves, but others too,    |
   |   who to escape bondage and slavery sought the protection of   |
   |   Melkor, the Lord of Angband, and became His allies.          |
   |                                                                |
   |   The elves who had come into Beleriand not much earlier       |
   |   than the men, and who were less numerous, nevertheless       |
   |   claimed Lordship over all the lands, even though they        |
   |   lived only in few places, and hardly could populate those.   |
   |   Under the overlordship of the elves, humans lived in         |
   |   Mithrim and Dor-Lomin, in Ladros, in the Forest of           |
   |   Brethil, and in Thargelion.  Some free houses who did not    |
   |   acknowledge any elven rule lived in East Beleriand, at the   |
   |   Andram, and around Amon Ereb.  Though these houses did not   |
   |   involve themselves in the wars of Beleriand, and sought      |
   |   naught but peace for themselves, they too fell victim to     |
   |   wrath of the Valar and perished at the end of the Age.       |
   |                                                                |
   |   During the course of the Wars of Beleriand, Hithlum and      |
   |   Dorthonion fell again under the control of the Lord of       |
   |   Angband, and were given as fiefs to the men who had          |
   |   become His allies.                                           |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Wars of Beleriand are described in detail in other       |
   |   works.  Here it may suffice to note the outcome of the       |
   |   wars:  Of all the men living in Beleriand in the First       |
   |   Age, only a few survived, those that were arrested by the    |
   |   elves and deported to the Island of Numenor.  All others,    |
   |   including everyone living in Hithlum and Dorthonion, and     |
   |   in East Beleriand perished miserably, when those who live    |
   |   in Aman and claim lordship of all of Arda without pity or    |
   |   remorse destroyed Beleriand, and murdered all living         |
   |   beings there, with no regard for sex or age, showing no      |
   |   more mercy to innocent children and women than to their      |
   |   foes in war.  Never before had any power of Arda killed so   |
   |   many, and never before had any power killed so many          |
   |   innocent people.                                             |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Peoples of Eriador                                       |
   |                                                                |
   |   Little is known of Eriador in the First Age, save that       |
   |   elves did not dwell there then.  Since many men of Eriador   |
   |   undertook to journey into Beleriand, it stands to reason     |
   |   that the peoples of Eriador prospered and multiplied in      |
   |   the First Age, so that their most adventuresome families     |
   |   decided to search for new lands and new fortunes west of     |
   |   the Ered Luin.  The lack of enemies and war is most likely   |
   |   also the reason that no large political bodies were          |
   |   founded, as the peoples of Beleriand saw no reason to do     |
   |   so, since their lives and freedom were not at risk during    |
   |   the First Age.                                               |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Chapter III: The Second Age of the Sun                       |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The First Millennium - the Elvish Invasion                   |
   |                                                                |
   |   The peace in Eriador came to an end at the beginning of      |
   |   the Second Age.  Survivors of the destruction of Beleriand   |
   |   --- only elves, no men among them! --- invaded Eriador in    |
   |   force.                                                       |
   |                                                                |
   |   It is instructive to compare the two great migrations,       |
   |   first the one of men from Eriador into Beleriand, then the   |
   |   one of elves from Beleriand into Eriador.  In the            |
   |   migration of men in the First Age, a numerous people came    |
   |   in peace into an underpopulated land.  When they met with    |
   |   the self-styled rulers of that land, most of the men         |
   |   accepted their lordship, and they were given land to work    |
   |   for their living only as bondsmen of the elven lords.  In    |
   |   the migration of the elves, a small band of survivors        |
   |   invaded a well populated land.  They took what they          |
   |   wished, with regard neither for the ancient rights nor for   |
   |   the needs of the men who had been living in Eriador in       |
   |   peace for centuries.                                         |
   |                                                                |
   |   Large parts of the land were occupied, and the men living    |
   |   there were driven away or slain.  The west and the east of   |
   |   Eriador fell completely under the rule of the elves:  the    |
   |   Ered Luin and the lands east of it ruled by a so-called      |
   |   'High King' in Mithlond;  the east under the control of      |
   |   elves who founded the city of Ost-in-Edhil in Eregion.       |
   |   Of the men who had been living in those lands, those who     |
   |   survived the invasion by the elves were driven away south-   |
   |   and eastward.  Of these, some settled in the forests that    |
   |   in those years still covered all lands along the coast in    |
   |   Eriador. Others fled further east, some settling in the      |
   |   fruitful vales north and south of the Ered Nimrais, some     |
   |   traveling as far as what is now known as Ithilien and        |
   |   Mordor.                                                      |
   |                                                                |
   |   In Mordor at that time resided Sauron, the Lord of           |
   |   Barad-Dur.  The construction of the Tower of Barad-Dur was   |
   |   begun around the year 1000 of the Second Age, and Sauron     |
   |   the Great was acknowledged Lord and Protector of all         |
   |   peoples of men that lived at that time in the East and the   |
   |   South of Middle Earth.  Sauron the Great received the        |
   |   fugitives from Eriador with open arms and gave them what     |
   |   help He had to offer.                                        |
   |                                                                |
   |   Heeding their prayers, He granted the fugitives protection   |
   |   against all who might try to drive them from their new       |
   |   lands.  He also send ambassadors to the elven lords of       |
   |   Mithlond and Ost-in-Edhil, but they were not received by     |
   |   the elves in their delusion.                                 |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Years of Parley (1200 S.A. - 1600 S.A.)                  |
   |                                                                |
   |   Unwilling to wage war unless war was unavoidable, after      |
   |   His ambassadors had been rejected, the Lord of Barad-Dur,    |
   |   He who had been acknowledged as High King by all peoples     |
   |   of the South Lands, and of the East, even beyond the Sea     |
   |   of Rhun, went to Eriador to parley in person for the         |
   |   peoples who had been driven out of their lands by the        |
   |   elven invaders.                                              |
   |                                                                |
   |   Coming to Mithlond, to the city of one Gil-Galad, who        |
   |   claimed to be `High King' of the elves of Middle Earth,      |
   |   the Lord of Barad-Dur was insulted and treated no better     |
   |   than His ambassadors, not being admitted by Gil-Galad.       |
   |   Ignoring this insult, He then turned to Ost-in-Edhil,        |
   |   there to parley with one Celebrimbor.  The elves of          |
   |   Eregion received the Lord of Barad-Dur, but were unwilling   |
   |   to parley when they perceived that the Lord of Barad-Dur     |
   |   was speaking for those they had driven from their lands.     |
   |   The Lord of Barad-Dur then offered His goodwill,             |
   |   friendship, and trade to the elves of Eregion should they    |
   |   return to the fugitives at least those lands they could      |
   |   not populate.  Hearing this, Celebrimbor made vague          |
   |   promises about taking such a move into consideration         |
   |   should the friendship of the Lord of Barad-Dur prove         |
   |   profitable enough.                                           |
   |                                                                |
   |   Seeing that war might be evaded, and that at least parts     |
   |   of the lands might be returned to the fugitives, the Lord    |
   |   of Barad-Dur decided to reveal part of His power to the      |
   |   elves of Eregion so they might be moved to grant His wish.   |
   |   Many gifts He made them, and knowing that the elves were     |
   |   enamoured with magic and power, He crafted rings which       |
   |   would give the elves control over the elements.  He          |
   |   offered these rings to Celebrimbor as token of His           |
   |   friendship should the elves permit the fugitives to return.  |
   |                                                                |
   |   Perceiving the power of the rings, Celebrimbor was burning   |
   |   with desire to possess them, but never did he consider to    |
   |   be truthful to his promises.  He therefore decided to        |
   |   steal the rings, and swiftly executed this plan, even        |
   |   attempting in his madness to slay the Lord of Barad-Dur.     |
   |   But no elf or man can be a danger to Him, and He returned    |
   |   to His land of Mordor.                                       |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The War for Eriador (1693 S.A. - 1701 S.A.)                  |
   |                                                                |
   |   Bound by His pledge to protect the fugitives, and after      |
   |   the failure of His attempts to parley with the elven         |
   |   invaders, no other way was left but open war to end the      |
   |   occupation of Eriador by the elves.  In the year 1695 of     |
   |   the Second Age, the Lord of Barad-Dur entered Eriador once   |
   |   more, but this time at the head of His armies.               |
   |   Ost-in-Edhil was conquered in 1697 S.A., and Celebrimbor,    |
   |   thief and liar, fell in the battle for the city.  The Lord   |
   |   of Barad-Dur then sent again ambassadors to Mithlond, now    |
   |   demanding that the fugitives be put in their right, and      |
   |   that all lands east of the Ered Luin be returned to them.    |
   |                                                                |
   |   Gil-Galad that time received the ambassadors and began       |
   |   parley, making some promises now, withdrawing them again,    |
   |   prolonging the negotiations by every means available.  On    |
   |   Yule 1699, he gave finally in to the demands of the Lord     |
   |   of Barad-Dur, swearing a solemn oath to respect the rights   |
   |   of the men who had been living in Eriador long before        |
   |   elves entered it from Beleriand.                             |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Lord of Barad-Dur then dismissed His armies, and         |
   |   returned to His land of Mordor, to bring the happy news to   |
   |   the fugitives, and to oversee Himself the preparations for   |
   |   the return of those of the fugitives who wished to return    |
   |   to the lands of their fathers.                               |
   |                                                                |
   |   Into these preparations suddenly broke the news of the       |
   |   treachery of Gil-Galad.  While he seemingly had parley       |
   |   with the ambassadors of Barad-Dur, he had sent for help      |
   |   from Numenor.  When that help arrived in 1700 S.A. all       |
   |   oaths were quickly forgotten, and war resumed.               |
   |                                                                |
   |   The armies of Barad-Dur were still on their march home, in   |
   |   peaceful mood and taking no special precaution, believing    |
   |   to be in peace time and protected by Gil-Galad's oaths.      |
   |   To lighten the burden on the countryside that comes when a   |
   |   large army has to be provisioned, the regiments took their   |
   |   way home by different routes, and marched with several       |
   |   days distance from each other.  When they were attacked      |
   |   suddenly from the rear by hosts of elves and from the        |
   |   flanks by men of Numenor who had landed on the coasts, the   |
   |   armies of Barad-Dur were ill-prepared for battle, and        |
   |   though all regiments fought with valour, they were singly    |
   |   and separately destroyed by foes who in every battle had a   |
   |   vast numerical superiority.                                  |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The First Numenorean Invasion (1800 S.A. - 2500 S.A.)        |
   |                                                                |
   |   After their great victory, the Numenoreans demanded and      |
   |   took the price for the assistance they had given the elves   |
   |   in their war against the men of Eriador.                     |
   |                                                                |
   |   Ignoring the ancient ties of blood with the people living    |
   |   in Eriador, the Numenoreans began their occupation,          |
   |   building great fortresses along the coast, as harbours for   |
   |   their war fleets, and to house the occupation forces.        |
   |   First of these fortresses was Lond Daer upon Gwathlo, from   |
   |   which all southern Eriador was first brought under the       |
   |   rule of Numenor, and then denuded of its forests to          |
   |   satisfy the unquenchable hunger of the Numenorean navy for   |
   |   wood.  In later years, Umbar and Pelargir upon Anduin were   |
   |   founded, each serving as a stronghold for the subjugation    |
   |   of the people living in the lands around it.                 |
   |                                                                |
   |   Exploiting the riches of Middle Earth, the Numenoreans       |
   |   brought rich bounty to their island from their colonies.     |
   |   And while Numenor grew rich and the Numenoreans lived in     |
   |   splendour and utmost luxury, the peoples of Middle Earth     |
   |   had to pay the price, and famine and poverty, which had      |
   |   before been unknown in the rich and fertile lands of         |
   |   Middle Earth, were the bitter fate of all living under the   |
   |   cruel yoke of the Numenorean invaders.                       |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Second Numenorean Invasion (3261 S.A.)                   |
   |                                                                |
   |   Not content with ruling over all the coast lands of Middle   |
   |   Earth from Harlindon to Umbar, Ar-Pharazon, King of          |
   |   Numenor, decided that he would make war on Sauron the        |
   |   Great, Lord of Barad-Dur, the protector of the South and     |
   |   the East, who was the only power still hindering the         |
   |   Numenoreans from expanding their rule over even more lands   |
   |   of Middle Earth.  In the year 3261 S.A., Ar-Pharazon         |
   |   landed with a vast army at Umbar, and prepared to invade     |
   |   Mordor in the following year.                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Perceiving that even a quick victory against such vast an    |
   |   army would result in death and devastation for many living   |
   |   under His protection, the Lord of Barad-Dur offered          |
   |   parley.  He resolved that He Himself would go to Umbar, to   |
   |   negotiate there with Ar-Pharazon, so that He might           |
   |   convince the king that not the Lord of Mordor was his        |
   |   enemy, but the elves and those of Aman.                      |
   |                                                                |
   |   In Ar-Pharazon the Lord of Barad-Dur found an ambitious      |
   |   man, but one with an open mind, and less twisted by the      |
   |   guile and the lies that the elves had spun for centuries     |
   |   to confuse men and to bind their minds in service unto       |
   |   them.  Thus war was averted by the wise counsel of the       |
   |   Lord of Barad-Dur, and many who would have died were         |
   |   spared.  Seeing that His words were not lost on the king,    |
   |   Sauron the Great consented to accompany Ar-Pharazon back     |
   |   to Numenor, to aid the king as counsellor.                   |
   |                                                                |
   |   When Ar-Pharazon, guided by the Lord of Barad-Dur, his new   |
   |   and wisest counsellor, perceived the truth about the elves   |
   |   and those who sit in Aman and claim to rule all of Arda,     |
   |   his wrath was terrible and his mind was set on revenge for   |
   |   the senseless slaying of so many men at the end of the       |
   |   First Age.  The king of Numenor then swore to make war       |
   |   against Aman, and to liberate Arda from oppression by the    |
   |   devils of Aman.                                              |
   |                                                                |
   |   But, alas, being of a free mind, he underestimated the       |
   |   force by which the elves hold in bondage the minds of        |
   |   lesser men.  The plans of king Ar-Pharazon were betrayed     |
   |   to Aman by an elf friend of his own court.                   |
   |                                                                |
   |   The traitor, one Amandil, clandestinely set sail to Aman     |
   |   and alerted its rulers.  What happened to the traitor is     |
   |   unknown, but since nothing is mentioned of him after his     |
   |   arrival in Aman, one may hope that he found his just         |
   |   reward at the hands of those of Aman, as he had outlived     |
   |   his usefulness for them.  This should be a warning to any    |
   |   who want to betray their king, land, and people to the       |
   |   enemy: they who profit by treason may still have no liking   |
   |   for the traitor.                                             |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Fall of Numenor does not belong to the History of        |
   |   Middle Earth, and its full account has been given            |
   |   elsewhere.  Here, let us just point out that once more       |
   |   those who claim to be the rulers of all Arda struck          |
   |   ruthlessly without showing any mercy, killing men, and       |
   |   women, and children, exterminating a people with less        |
   |   compunction than a farmer might show towards killing the     |
   |   vermin in his fields.  And still some cling to their false   |
   |   beliefs and give honour instead of contempt to those of      |
   |   Aman, and their henchmen, the elves.                         |
   |                                                                |
   |   After the destruction of Numenor, the lords of Aman set      |
   |   out with vast hosts to conquer all of Middle Earth.  It      |
   |   was their plan to kill all men and to give the lands of      |
   |   Middle Earth into the hands of the elves.  The hosts of      |
   |   Aman landed in the far South of Middle Earth, in lands       |
   |   strange and far distant from the Westlands.  For many long   |
   |   years in these lands unheard of to most living today in      |
   |   Gondor or Mordor, a terrible war was fought in defence of    |
   |   all men of Middle Earth against the invaders from Aman.      |
   |   The forces of the defenders were led by Sauron the Great,    |
   |   who far from his own land of Mordor in that war saved the    |
   |   men of Middle Earth from death and destruction that Aman     |
   |   had planned for them.  In the end, the invasion was beaten   |
   |   off through the wise leadership of Sauron the Great, and     |
   |   those of Aman in panic returned to whence they came. To      |
   |   escape the just wrath of the men of Middle Earth, ever       |
   |   since then they have made Aman inaccessible from the         |
   |   outside for all but elves, hiding there in fear.  The        |
   |   lands in the South where the war was waged, however, never   |
   |   recovered from the terrible battles, and ever since then     |
   |   they have been deserts and wastelands.                       |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Third Numenorean Invasion (3320 S.A. - 3441 S.A.)        |
   |                                                                |
   |   The only survivors of the Downfall of Numenor were some of   |
   |   the family of the traitor Amandil, and those Numenoreans     |
   |   who had been living in the cities and fortresses along the   |
   |   coasts of Middle Earth.                                      |
   |                                                                |
   |   The spawn of Amandil, though only few in number, was quick   |
   |   to claim rulership, not only over those settlements of       |
   |   Numenoreans on the coasts, but over all of Eriador and all   |
   |   the lands north and south of the Ered Nimrais, and even      |
   |   over Ithilien, on the east bank of the Anduin.  That these   |
   |   lands were populated by men who had been living there for    |
   |   centuries, sometimes even for millenia before the exiles     |
   |   arrived to claim lordship, did not seem to bother them.      |
   |                                                                |
   |   After having fortified their possessions and dividing the    |
   |   lands among themselves, they decided to make war against     |
   |   Barad-Dur, and invaded Mordor.  Barad-Dur at that time was   |
   |   held only by a small force, commanded by a Lieutenant of     |
   |   the Lord of Barad-Dur, as Sauron the Great and the larger    |
   |   part of His forces were defending Middle Earth in the far    |
   |   South against the invasion from Aman.  Nevertheless, even    |
   |   combined with the forces of the elves, the exiles had to     |
   |   lay siege to Barad-Dur for seven years before they could     |
   |   take it.                                                     |
   |                                                                |
   |   During the course of the siege, there grew strife between    |
   |   the heirs of the realms in Exile, Isildur and Anarion.       |
   |   Isildur as the elder son claimed to be heir of all the       |
   |   realms held by the exiles.  Anarion, the younger, claimed    |
   |   the south kingdom as his inheritance.  Their father          |
   |   Elendil, son of the traitor Amandil, took the side of the    |
   |   younger son, believing Isildur to be too vain and too        |
   |   ambitious to be trusted with the kingship over all the       |
   |   lands held by the exiles.  One day, in 3440 S.A., Anarion    |
   |   was found murdered in his tent, where he was recovering      |
   |   from a slight headwound he had received from a stone         |
   |   thrown by the valiant defenders of Barad-Dur.                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Suspicion turned against Isildur, who was thought capable    |
   |   of such a vile deed by his father and by Gil-Galad more      |
   |   than by any other, but no proof was found.                   |
   |                                                                |
   |   In the following year Barad-Dur finally surrendered.  The    |
   |   Lord of Barad-Dur, far away in the South, had learnt that    |
   |   His soldiers were besieged by forces vastly superior in      |
   |   numbers. In order to save their lives, He commanded them     |
   |   to surrender should safe-conduct be granted to them.  And    |
   |   thus, after Elendil had sworn a solemn oath not to slay      |
   |   the defenders should they surrender the Tower of Barad-Dur   |
   |   to him, the siege was finally ended, and the invaders were   |
   |   victorious. But from Gil-Galad, Elendil had heard of Rings   |
   |   of Power forged by the Lord of Barad-Dur that were said to   |
   |   be hidden in the Tower of Barad-Dur.  To find those rings    |
   |   was Elendil's purpose, and when a first search of Barad-Dur  |
   |   proved futile, Elendil ordered to torture the captive        |
   |   defenders, breaking his oath to spare their lives.           |
   |                                                                |
   |   When all but one of the defenders had died under the         |
   |   torture, the last survivor perceived that his life, too,     |
   |   was forfeit, and that in his greed Elendil would never       |
   |   accept that what he searched for did not exist.  This last   |
   |   of the defenders then made up a story of one Ring of Power   |
   |   that could control all other rings, and that this One Ring   |
   |   would give eternal life, and absolute power, thus feeding    |
   |   Elendil's greed, turning it into a fire that devoured        |
   |   Elendil internally.  Thus, even though he died shortly       |
   |   thereafter, the last defender of Barad-Dur took his          |
   |   terrible revenge of Elendil.                                 |
   |                                                                |
   |   What happened then is hidden more than all else by a web     |
   |   of lies and deceit.  All that is known is that after         |
   |   hearing the tale of the 'One Ring', Gil-Galad, Elendil,      |
   |   and Isildur alone entered the chamber at the top of the      |
   |   tower of Barad-Dur one last time, there to search for the    |
   |   'One Ring'.  Together they went in, and out came Isildur     |
   |   alone, with a tale even more fantastic than the one about    |
   |   the 'One Ring'.  Isildur claimed that his father Elendil,    |
   |   Gil-Galad, and he had fought with the Lord of Barad-Dur      |
   |   Himself in that topmost chamber of the Tower, and that       |
   |   only he alone survived that battle.  And Isildur also        |
   |   claimed that he had cut the 'One Ring', this figment of      |
   |   the imagination of a tortured and dying man, from the hand   |
   |   of the Lord of Barad-Dur.                                    |
   |                                                                |
   |   Having little chance to prove Isildur wrong, most of the     |
   |   the exiles accepted his tale.  Others, less credulous,       |
   |   accused him of first slaying his brother, and now his        |
   |   father.  Few of those who made these accusations lived       |
   |   long thereafter, none survived unless they fled from         |
   |   Isildur's wrath into the East.                               |

   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Chapter IV: The Third Age of the Sun                         |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Throughout the Third Age, Middle Earth has for the most      |
   |   parts either been under the dominion of the exiles of        |
   |   Numenor, or it has been depopulated by their wars.           |
   |                                                                |
   |   Since there are many accounts of the history of the Realms   |
   |   in Exile, their history will not be repeated here. The       |
   |   topic of this account is the fate of the peoples native to   |
   |   Middle Earth, and the history of the Realms in Exile (or     |
   |   rather, Realms of Occupation) will enter this account only   |
   |   where it touches this topic.                                 |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Eriador                                                      |
   |                                                                |
   |   In the wars of the Second Age, Eriador had been              |
   |   depopulated.  The men living there had either been slain     |
   |   by the elves and Numenoreans, or been driven away, or        |
   |   later, under Numenorean rule, often starved by merciless     |
   |   taxes and levies.                                            |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Ered Nimrais and Dunland - the Dunlendings               |
   |                                                                |
   |   The western vales of the Ered Nimrais, north and south of    |
   |   the mountains, and the lands west of the mountains to the    |
   |   sea were the lands of the Dunlendings.  They were the        |
   |   descendants of the men driven out of Eriador by the elves    |
   |   at the beginning of the Second Age.                          |
   |                                                                |
   |   For many centuries they lived in peace and prospered as      |
   |   farmers and hunters, from time to time being forced to       |
   |   acknowledge nominally the authority of the south kingdom.    |
   |                                                                |
   |   This good fortune lasted until the year 2510 T.A., when      |
   |   the steward of the south kingdom gave Calenardhon and the    |
   |   lands of the Dunlendings to a wild tribe from the north,     |
   |   called 'Horsemen' or 'Rohirrim'.  The Rohirrim quickly       |
   |   subjugated the Dunlendings, stealing their land and their    |
   |   farms, sometimes permitting the old owners to stay on the    |
   |   land as serfs of the new lords, sometimes slaying them,      |
   |   sometimes driving them into the mountains.                   |
   |                                                                |
   |   To this day, the Dunlendings are a people without rights     |
   |   in their own land, and may be killed by one of the           |
   |   Rohirrim without peril or consequence.  The most infamous    |
   |   of these murders was committed by one of the chieftains of   |
   |   the Rohirrim, who call themselves kings.  The victim was     |
   |   one Freca, who by valour, industry, and wisdom had become    |
   |   respected by the Rohirrim even though many despised him      |
   |   for he had Dunlending ancestors.                             |
   |                                                                |
   |   The chieftain of the Rohirrim, one Helm, had grown envious   |
   |   of Freca, so he invited him to his hall.  There Helm slew    |
   |   Freca, his guest, by his own hand.  Then Helm confiscated    |
   |   Freca's property, and declared Freca's son and his next of   |
   |   kin to be enemies of the king.                               |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Calenardhon and Anorien - the Druedain                       |
   |                                                                |
   |   North of the Ered Nimrais lived since the dawn of time an    |
   |   ancient people.  Unlike the Dunlendings, they built large    |
   |   settlements, but like so many other peoples of Middle        |
   |   Earth they were too peaceful of mind to engage in war and    |
   |   conquest.  Their language was alien to the Common Tongue     |
   |   and other languages spoken in Middle Earth, probably         |
   |   because they were not influenced by elves.  In many vales    |
   |   north of the Ered Nimrais there can still be seen remnants   |
   |   of their settlements, the best known being Dunharrow,        |
   |   where the Pukelmen give testimony of the ancient lords of    |
   |   that valley.                                                 |
   |                                                                |
   |   With the coming of the exiles, the Druedain were driven      |
   |   from the plains of Calenardhon, and took refuge in the       |
   |   mountains and forests.  After losing most of their land      |
   |   they became a people perpetually in flight and hiding,       |
   |   developing woodman skills, but still ever diminishing        |
   |   in number and retreating deeper and deeper into the          |
   |   forests and mountains.                                       |
   |                                                                |
   |   Their lot became even worse with the arrival of the          |
   |   Rohirrim in Calenardhon, who took to hunting the 'Wild       |
   |   Men of the Woods', as they called the Druedain, for          |
   |   sport.                                                       |
   |                                                                |
   |   Today, only a small remnant of the Druedain still exists,    |
   |   living deep in Druedain Forest, which alone of all the       |
   |   lands that today are called Anorien and Rohan, which once    |
   |   were their own, remains to them.  But even here, the         |
   |   Druedain are still persecuted, now by so-called rangers, a   |
   |   group of assassins and spies that the exiles are training.   |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   The Southlands - Umbar and Harad                             |
   |                                                                |
   |   Like Pelargir, Umbar was founded by Numenoreans. But         |
   |   unlike the harbour on the Anduin, Umbar always remained      |
   |   faithful to the rightful ruler of Numenor, and never         |
   |   accepted the rule of the exiles, spawn of traitors.          |
   |                                                                |
   |   Whenever the power of the south kingdom was secured, it      |
   |   strove to conquer and destroy Umbar, the city which alone    |
   |   in all of Arda still represents the loyal and faithful       |
   |   Numenoreans, and the existence of which is a constant        |
   |   reminder to the exiles of the foul act of high treason by    |
   |   which Amandil sent his people to the death.                  |
   |                                                                |
   |   After the Downfall of Numenor, Umbar has acknowledged the    |
   |   Lordship of the Lord of Barad-Dur, counsellor and heir of    |
   |   the last king of Numenor.  Many faithful servants of         |
   |   Barad-Dur have come out of the midst of the people of        |
   |   Umbar, and Umbar has always been a safe haven for all        |
   |   people persecuted in the Realms of Occupation.               |
   |                                                                |
   |   Though Umbar has known some defeats in the centuries in      |
   |   which it often stood alone against the might of the Realms   |
   |   of Occupation, it has never completely fallen, even though   |
   |   twice the south kingdom succeeded in occupying it            |
   |   temporarily.                                                 |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |                                                                |
   |   Chapter V: Afterword                                         |
   |                                                                |
   |   I have shown what can be learned about the actual            |
   |   historical facts even from the distorted accounts that       |
   |   are kept by the exiles.                                      |
   |                                                                |
   |   I would like to beg the indulgence of the reader for some    |
   |   concluding thoughts.                                         |
   |                                                                |
   |   Many today in Middle Earth still give honour to elves,       |
   |   mayhap even pray to those living in Aman as if to Gods,      |
   |   and submit voluntarily to the rule of exiles.  But to        |
   |   those who live in Middle Earth and who know the history      |
   |   of their people and their land, this can be only folly or    |
   |   worse.                                                       |
   |                                                                |
   |   Ever since men entered Arda, the elves have been trying to   |
   |   enslave them.  The property, freedom, and life of men has    |
   |   been endangered every time men have encountered elves.       |
   |   Elves denied men the right to settle in peace in             |
   |   Beleriand, elves drove men from their land in Eriador, and   |
   |   elves still today hope that one day those of Aman will       |
   |   kill all men and give all of Middle Earth to them.           |
   |                                                                |
   |   But worse than the elves are those of Aman who claim the     |
   |   rulership of all of Arda.  In their wrath, they have twice   |
   |   in the history of Arda destroyed vast lands with all the     |
   |   people living there, slaying children, men, and women        |
   |   alike, making no difference between a warrior that was       |
   |   prepared to meet with them in open war and the babe that     |
   |   was still suckling its mother's breast.  In war, many        |
   |   atrocities are committed, but neither elf nor dwarf nor      |
   |   man has ever been as base or as cruel as the devils of       |
   |   Aman.                                                        |
   |                                                                |
   |   And finally, the exiles, who for themselves claim the name   |
   |   Dunedain.  Twice the forefathers of those who returned to    |
   |   Middle Earth as exiles have forfeit their rights to live     |
   |   in Middle Earth:  First, when they departed into Beleriand,  |
   |   and again, when they chose to depart for Numenor.            |
   |                                                                |
   |   All claims of the exiles for rulership are thus shown to     |
   |   be without foundation and vain.                              |
   |                                                                |
   |   Moreover, let us not forget that those who came to Middle    |
   |   Earth as exiles after the Downfall of Numenor were vile      |
   |   traitors, enemies of their own people and of their king.     |
   |   The traitors had no rights or authority in Numenor, and no   |
   |   rights or authority can they have in Middle Earth.           |
   |                                                                |
   |   The rightful Lord of Middle Earth is He whom the peoples     |
   |   of Middle Earth chose to be their Lord and protector, He     |
   |   who dwelleth in the Tower of Barad-Dur in the land of        |
   |   Mordor, whence He will come one day to drive exiles and      |
   |   elves back across the Belegaer to Aman.                      |
   |                                                                |
  /                                                                /
