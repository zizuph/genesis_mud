      The Battle Cries used by the Rangers
      ====================================

* All races: For Elendil!
             For Isildur!
             For Anarion!
             For Gondor!
             For King and Steward!

Elendil was the Last Lord of Andunie on Numenor and leader of the 
faithful. He and his two sons Isildur and Anarion escaped the the fall
of Numenor and founded the realms in exile, Gondor and Arnor. Elendil 
was King in Arnor, Isildur and Anarion in Gondor. Anarion was killed
during the siege of Barad-Dur in the War of the Last Alliance, Elendil
was slain, along with Gil-Galad, last High King of the Elves in Middle
Earth, in the final battle with Sauron, who was killed, too. Isildur 
claimed the One Ring as weregild. He was later ambushed and killed on
the marsh back from Mians Tirith to Arnor in the Battle of the Gladden
Fields. (cf. Akallabeth, Numenor, Gondor, Arnor)


* Humans: Utulie'n aure!
          Auta i lome!
          Aure entuluva!

From the Annals of Beleriand in the Simarillion:
Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad - Tears Unnumbered
...
Then Fingon looked towards Thangorodrim, and there was a dark cloud 
about it, and a black smoke went up; and he knew that the wrath of 
Morgoth was aroused, and that their challenge was accepted.
... 
But now a cry went up, passing up the wind from the south from vale to 
vale, and Elves and Men lifted their voices in wonder and joy. For
unsummoned and unlooked for Turgon had opened the leaguer of Gondolin, 
and was come with an army ten thousand strong, with bright mail and long
swords and spears like a forest. Then when Fingon heard afar the great
trumpet of Turgon his brother, the shadow passed and his heart was 
uplifted, and he shouted aloud: 'Utulie'n aure! Aiya Eldalie ar 
Atanatari, utulie'n aure! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar 
and Fathers of Men, the day has come!' And all those who heart his
great voice echo in the hills answered crying: 'Auta i lome! The night
is passing!'
...
Last of all Hurin stood alone. The he cast aside his shield, and wielded
an axe two-handed; and it is sung that the axe smoked in the black blood 
of the troll-guard of Gothmog until it withered, and each time that he
slew Hurin cried: 'Aure entuluva! Day shall come again!' Seventy times
he uttered that cry; but they took him at last alive, by the command of
Morgoth. ...
(cf FirstAge and FirstAgeEnd)


* Elves: Galadriel!
         Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!
         Aiya elenion ancalima!

Galadriel, princess of the Noldor, daughter of Finarfin, son of Finwe, 
first King of the Noldor, and of Earwen, daughter of Olwe, King of the
Teleri, Lord of Alaqualonde. Among all the heroes of the First Age, she
is the only that remained in Middle Earth, from the flight of the
Noldor before the coming of the sun and the moon through the battles of
Beleriand, and the wars of the Second Age. She now resides in 
Lothlorien. 

Gilthoniel ('Star-kindler') and Elbereth ('Star-queen') are two of the 
names of Varda, greatest of the Valier, spouse of Manwe. Before the
coming of the elves to Middle Earth, Varda created the greatest of the
stars in the heavens from the dew of Telperion.

'Aiya elenion ancalima' translated into the Westron means 'Hail, Brightest 
of Stars!' The Brightest of Stars is of course the Silmaril worn by
Earendil on his brow when sailing the sky.


* Dwarves: Baruk Khazad!     - The Axes of the Dwarves!
           Khazad ai-menu!   - The Dwarves are among you!
           Khazad-dum!
           For Durin!

Khazad-dum was the greatest of the Dwarf-halls, the mansion and folk-
home of Durin's folk, carved by Durin I early in the First Age in the
caves overlooking Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dell. Khazad-dum was called
Dwarrowdelf in Westron, Hadhodrond in Sindarin. In the last part of the
Third Age, the more usual Sindarin name was Moria (Dark Pit), though
dwarves did not use that name.


* Hobbits: For the Shire!
