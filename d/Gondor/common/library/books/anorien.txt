                                ANORIEN

Anorien, ("Sun-land"), is one of the two original fiefs and provinces of
Gondor, and now the most important. The land is bordered by River Anduin
to the east, River Erui to the south, and Rohan, (previously Calenardhon)
to the west and north. The Mering Stream marks the border between Rohan and
Anorien. Anorien was originally the desmene of Anarion, son of Elendil. The
chief city of Anorien is Minas Tirith, originally named Minas Anor, ("Tower
of the Sun"), and this is the capital of Gondor today. Anorien is a land of
very fertile areas, and also contains the Druedain Forest.
