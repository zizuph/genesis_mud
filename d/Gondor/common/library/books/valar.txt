Eru Illuvatar's thought gave birth to the Ainur, the offspring of his mind.
Of these spirits, the Valar were the most powerful, and there were fifteen
of them. These were his servants, and he instructed them in singing the 
Great Music of the Creation. Each of the Valar had a place in the Creation,
and there was great harmony in their singing. They created the Heavens, and
they created the Earth, and they called the Earth Arda, and they called the
whole Creation Ea.
One of the Valar was however not content with singing in harmony with the
others, he was more interested in creating discord and unbalance in the
Creation. He took things the other Valar had created, and corrupted them
in mockery of the other Valar. This was not looked kindly upon by the other
Valar, and he was cast out from Aman, the continent on Arda where the Ainur
lived.

The Valar were fifteen in number, and ancient writings list them in this
fashion:

Manwe Sulimo, King of the Valar, Lord of the Air.
Varda Elbereth, Queen of the Valar, the Star-kindler, also called Gilthoniel.
Ulmo, the Ocean Lord, Master of Waters.
Aule Mahal, the Smith, Master of the Earth.
Yavanna Kementari, Mistress of the Earth, Giver of Fruits.
Namo Mandos, Keeper of the Dead, Lord of the Halls of Awaiting.
Nienna, the Weeper, the Sufferer.
Orome Araw, the Huntsman, Tamer of Beasts, Master of the Forest.
Vana, the Ever-young, Mistress of Flowers and Song.
Tulkas Astaldo, Champion of the Valar, the Valiant.
Nessa, the Dancer, Mistress of Celebration.
Irmo Lorien, the Dream Master, Lord of Visions, Lord of Love.
Este, the Healer, Mistress of the Fountains of Renewal.
Vaire, the Weaver of Time, Mistress of Memory.
Melkor Morgoth, the Black Enemy, the Unmaker, Master of Fire, the Fallen.

The Valar live in Valinor, a fortress in Aman, the legend continent far
west of the continent of Middle-earth, and rarely make contact with the
mortals anymore.
