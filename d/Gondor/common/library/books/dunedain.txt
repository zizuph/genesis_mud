                             THE DUNEDAIN

The Dunedain are a Mannish race, descendants of the Edain who at the
beginning of the Second Age sailed to Numenor. After the Fall of Numenor
in year 3319 of Second Age, the Dunedain survived only in the Faithful,
and in the Black Numenoreans of Umbar. The Faithful Dunedain founded two
kingdoms, Gondor and Arnor, and after the death of their leader Elendil,
the Dunedain were split into two groups, those of the North, and those
of Gondor.
  The Dunedain of the North suffered great losses in wars and in the Great
Plague. However, some still survived with the aid of Elrond Half-elven,
and became the Rangers of the North, ruled by the Line of Isildur.
  The Dunedain of Gondor flourished for many years despite threats from
Harad and Rhun, but they suffered decadence and pride, the Line of
Anarion, the family of Kings in Gondor failed. Also intermarriage with
lesser Men lessened the purity of the Dunadan blood, although some families
retained their nobility, and were enriched by Elvish blood.
  The Dunedain are superior to other Men in nobility of spirit and body,
although capable of evil if corrupted. They are tall, with dark hair and
grey eyes. The purest Dunedain often lived to be 210 years old, while the
lesser Dunedain may live about 130 years. The Faithful love the Elves, and
there is great hatred between them and Sauron.
  The Dunedain of Gondor currently have no king, but are governed by the
Ruling Stewards. The present Steward is Denethor II, awaiting the Return
of the Heir of Isildur.
The Dunedain of the North are ruled by Chieftains, currently Thorongil.
