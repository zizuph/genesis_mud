It is believed that the orcs were breed in the deeps of time by
Melkor, whom Feanor named Morgoth, by twisting and torturing
captured elves. No matter what he later did this was considered
one of his most evil deeds.

Orcs find pleasure only in the agony of others and their black
blood runs cold in their veins. They have skin the hue of black
charred wood. Their stature is broad and squat with bow-legged
legs and bent backs. Their faces are broad and flat the eyes
like small glowing slits in a black furnace. Their mouths filled
with yellow fangs and a large red tongue. They have long and
strong arms with clawed hands.

They used to fear the light but lately a new breed of orcs have
appeared, the uruk-hai, that is larger and does not fear the light.
These uruks are used as leaders of smaller orcs and in elite
companies. Unlike the orcs of old they do not use scimitars but
rather large swords.
