			THE ROHIRRIM

The Rohirrim People are a Mannish race, descendants from the Eotheod.
The Eotheod originally lived in the Vales of Anduin, until they in
year 2510 of the Third Age rode to Gondor in aid against an army of orcs.
The Eotheod, led by Eorl the Young, were then given the Gondorian province of
Calenardhon as reward by Cirion, Steward  of Gondor. The Eotheod them swore 
the Oath of Eorl, promising aid to Gondor at need in return. The Eotheod
named their new land Rohan, 'Horse-land', and were themselves called the
Rohirrim, the Horse-lord people.
The Rohirrim are tall and blond, with fair faces; often live to be about
eighty, and retain their strength even in old age. The Rohirrim love their
horses above all else; they raise the noblest horses and are the best
horsemen in all of Middle-earth.
They call themselves the Eorlingas, 'sons of Eorl', and because of their
natural nobility and the Oath of Eorl, have always remained friendly to
Gondor, and deadly to their enemies.
The current King of the Rohirrim is Theoden, son of Thengel.
The Rohirrim live in Rohan, with the capital in Edoras.
