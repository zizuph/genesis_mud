                      OF THE SILMARILS

'Twas in the times of the First Age, following the Unchaining of Melkor,
that Feanor, the Noldorian prince, wrought the greatest works of craft
ever produced by the Children of Illuvatar. These were the Silmarils,
jewels fashioned with shells of silima, but at their heart was the ever-
radiant light of the Two Trees, and the Silmarils shone by themselves.
They were hallowed by Varda so that any impure hand touching thme would
be burnt and withered.
  Feanor soon lost his heart to these jewels, and as Melkor, who also lusted
for them, influenced him, he kept them locked away, becoming greedy.
It is said that when Melkor and Ungoliant poisoned the Two Trees, Feanor
refused to sacrifice the Silmarils to restore the Trees, and at that time
they were eventually stolen by Melkor. Feanor and his sons then took a
great and terrible Oath, swearing that their House should ever seek to
recover the Silmarils and pursue the thieves. Melkor fled from Valinor to
Middle-earth, and Feanor, in his haste and pride, convinced the Noldor in
following him. This led to the Kin-slaying in Aqualonde, when the Noldor
slayed the Teleri-elves, to steal their ships and sail to Middle-earth.
Melkor fortified himself in Angband, setting the Silmarills in his Iron
Crown. There they remained, luring the Noldorian Exiles to their doom.
