                                  ITHILIEN

Ithilien, ("Moon-land"), is the second of the two original fiefs and provinces
of Gondor, but is now deserted by the Gondorians. Ithilien was given to
Isildur by his father, Elendil the Tall, to be his demesne. It covers the
area bordered by River Anduin to the west, River Poros to the south, and the
Ephel Duath, the western mountain-range of Mordor to the east. Its capital
city was Minas Ithil, built on a western spur of the Ephel Duath in SA 3320,
now known as Minas Morgul because of the dark sorcery the city now contains.
After the fall of Minas Ithil in Third Age 2002, the inhabitants of Ithilien
began to flee, as the land always had been bearing the brunt of Sauron's
attacks on Gondor from its founding. From TA 2901, Mordor-orcs began invading
Ithilien, and most of the inhabitants deserted the land. However, a force of
Dunedain, called the Rangers of Ithilien was founded, and built secret
refuges in Ithilien, hidden to all but the Rangers.
In 2954 of the Third Age, Mount Doom, the great volcano in Mordor burst
into flame and Sauron openly declared himself and his intentions, and the
rest of the inhabitants of Ithilien fled across the Anduin, leaving only
the Rangers to wreak havoc on Sauron's forces.
Ithilien was once the fairest land of the West, with great forests and
farmlands along the River Anduin in North Ithilien, and the Emyn Arnen hills
and grasslands in South Ithilien. Ithilien is divided into these two parts
by the Ithilduin (now called Morgulduin) Stream, flowing from the valley
just north of Minas Ithil (now Minas Morgul), out into the River Anduin
just south of the ruins of Osgiliath.
