                                   ARNOR

Arnor, ("Royal-land"), was the first Dunedain Kingdom in Middle-earth, founded
in year 3320 of the Second Age by Elendil the tall, who was its first king.
Arnor at its greatest included all the lands between the River Bruinen
and Gwathlo and the River Lhun. The first capital was Annuminas, built on
the shores of Lake Nenuial, but before TA 861 the capital was moved to
Fornost, the chief city of the country. Unlike Gondor, Arnor did not
prosper, and the dwindling of the Dunedain began already in year 2 of the
Third Age, in the Battle of the Gladden Fields, when Isildur, son of
Elendil and second king of Arnor was slain by a band of orcs. However,
unlike Gondor, where the Line of Anarion died out with Earnur in TA 2050,
the Line of Isildur, the descent of the rulers of Arnor has been preserved
throughout all its troubles. When Earendur, the tenth King of Arnor, died
in TA 861, Arnor was split among his three sons, with the eldest becoming
King of Arthedain. The other two kingdoms, Cardolan and Rhudaur quickly
dwindled, Cardolan effectively destroyed by the Witch-king of Angmar by
1409, and Rhudaur infiltrated even earlier. Then, when Arthedain in TA 1349
claimed lordship over all of Arnor, this was used as a pretext by both
Rhudaur and Angmar to attack Arthedain, and in TA 1974 the kingdom fell.
The heirs of Isildur have since been known as the Chieftains of the North,
never since claiming kingship. The identity of the heir of Isildur is held
a secret with Elrond Half-elven in Rivendell.
Arnor was also known as the North-kingdom. Notable places were:
Fornost, Annuminas and Amon Sul.
