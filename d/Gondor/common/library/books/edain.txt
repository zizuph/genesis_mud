                        THE EDAIN

Of the Edain there were three great families. The First House comprised
the people of Beor. The Second House was called the Haladin, and they
differed in speech and life from the House of Beor. After Beor's people
entered Beleriand, they waited for words concerning what was west of the
Ered Luin, and a year after they too journeyed into Beleriand. The Third
House was the largest family of the Edain, and followed Marach. Because
of their great numbers, they arrived in Beleriand two years after Beor.
The Eldar of Beleriand named the Edain the Atani, the Second People, while
the Avari called them by their own tongue the Edain, and that name only
speaks of Men whose blood comes from the three Kindreds of the Elf-friends.

During the wars against Morgoth in the end of the First Age, the Edain
fought alongside the Eldar, and suffered dearly before the war was ended.
Then, in the Second Age, the Valar created an island continent in the midst
of the Great Sea west of Middle-earth, known as the island of Numenor,
Westernesse or Andor. The majority of the Edain settled this island, and
became the Numenoreans, or the Dunedain, the Edain of the West, developing
a brilliant culture which was largely based on the teachings of the Eldar.
