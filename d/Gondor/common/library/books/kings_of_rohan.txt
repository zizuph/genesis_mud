This is the list of the Kings of Rohan of the House of Eorl
-----------------------------------------------------------

Year      First Line
          ----------
2485-2545 1. Eorl the Young.
          He was so named because he succeeded his father in youth and
          remainded yellow-haired and ruddy to the end of his days.
          These were shortened by a renewed attack of the Easterlings.
          Eorl fell in battle in the Wold, and the first mound was
          raised. Felarof, his horse, was laid there also.
2512-2570 2. Brego.
          He drove the enemy out of the Wold, and Rohan was not attacked
          again for many years. In 2569 he completed the great hall of
          Meduseld. At the feast his son Baldor vowed that he would
          tread 'the Paths of the Dead' and did not return. Brego died
          of grief the next year.
2544-2645 3. Aldor the Old.
          He was Brego's second son. He became known as the Old, since
          he lived to a great age, and was king for 75 years. In his
          time the Rohirrim increased, and drove out or subdued the last
          of the Dunlendish people that lingered east of Isen.
          Harrowdale and the other mountain-valleys were settled. Of the
          next three kings little is said, for Rohan had peace and
          prospered in their time.
2570-2659 4. Frea.
          Eldest son, but fourth child ol Aldor; he was already old when
          he became king.
2594-2680 5. Freawine.
2619-2699 6. Goldwine.
2644-2718 7. Deor.
          In his time the Dunlendings raided often over the Isen. In
          2710 they occupied the deserted ring of Isengard, and could
          not be dislodged.
2668-2741 8. Gram.
2691-2759 9. Helm Hammerhand.
          At the end of his reign Rohan suffered great loss, by invasion
          and the Long Winter. Helm and his sons Haleth and Hama
          perished. Frealaf, Helm's sister's son, became king.

          Second Line
          -----------
2726-2798 10. Frealaf Hildeson.
          In his time Saruman came to Isengard, from which the
          Dunlendings had been driven. The Rohirrim at first profited by
          his friendship in the days of dearth and weakness that
          followed.
2752-2842 11. Brytta.
          He was called by his people Leofa, for he was loved by all; he
          was openhanded and a help to all the needy. In his time there
          was war with Orcs that, driven from the North, sought refuges
          in the White Mountains. When he died it was thought that they
          had all been hunted out; but it was not so.
2780-2851 12. Walda.
          He was king only nine years. He was slain with all his
          companions when they were trapped by orcs, as they rode by
          mountain-paths from Dunharrow.
2804-2864 13. Folca.
          He was a great hunter, but he vowed to chase no wild beast
          while there was an orc left in Rohan. When the last orc was
          found and destroyed, he went to hunt the great boar of
          Everholt in the Firien Wood. He slew the boar but died of the
          tusk-wounds that it gave him.
2830-2903 14. Folcwine.
          When he became king the Rohirrim had recovered their strength.
          He reconquered the west-march (between Andorn and Isen) that
          Dunlendings had occupied. Rohan had received great help from
          Gondor in the evil days, When, therefore, he heard that the
          Haradrim were assailing Gondor with great strenght, he sent
          many men to the help of the Steward. He wished to lead them
          himself, but was dissuaded, and his twin sons Folcred and
          Fastred (born 2858) went in his stead. They fell side by side
          in battle in Ithilien (2885). Turin II of Gondor sent to
          Folcwine a rich weregild of gold.
2870-2953 15. Fengel.
          He was the third son and fourth child of Folcwine. He is not
          remembered with praise. He was greedy of food and of gold, and
          at strife with his marshals, and with his children. Thengel,
          his third child and only son, left Rohan when he came to
          manhood and lived long in Gondor, and won honour in the
          service of Turgon.
2905-2980 16. Thengel.
          He took no wife until late, but in 2943 he wedded Morwen of
          Lossarnach in Gondor, though she was seventeen years his
          younger. She bore him three children in Gondor, of whom
          Theoden, the second, was his only son. When Fengel died, the
          Rohirrim recalled him, and he returned unwillingly. But he
          proved a good and wise king; though the speech of Gondor was
          used in his house, and not all men thought that good. Morwen
          bore him two more daughters in Rohan; and the last, Theodwyn,
          was the fairest, though she came late (2963), the child of his
          age. Her brother loved her dearly.
            It was soon after Thengel's return that Saruman declared
          himself Lord of Isengard and began to give trouble to Rohan,
          encroaching on its borders and supporting its enemies.
2948      17. Theoden.
          He is the present King of Rohan.
