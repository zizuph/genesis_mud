                        THE FIRST AGE

'Twas in the beginning of the History of Men, while the Mannish Races
yet had to learn about Elves. Gathering in Hildorien, the Men were never
offered guidance by the Valar, and only the most adventurous of them
set out on a journey, following the beacon of the daystar, the Sun's
way westwards. These were two groups - the Lintador, among whom were the
Edain, the Arhunedain or Arhunerim and the Druedain, - and the Aravador,
among whom were the Avarim or Womaw, the Harnerim, the Mornerim, the
Talatherim and the Linerim. The other, now forgotten races settled in
the rest of Middle-earth, in places far east and south of Eriador, and
this was the First Sundering of Men.
The Lintador befriended the Avari-elves of Eriador, and learned from them
speech, the tales of the Eldar and the legend of the Great Journey.
The Aravador however, shunned the Elves, and their superstition and fear
was exploited by Morgoth, who seduced them into making war on the Lintador.
This, and the the tales of the Eldar Realm in Beleriand, made the Lintador
travel further northwestward, and settle beyond the River Anduin, in the
rich hills of what later became Arnor. Then, after prospering there, Beor
brought the First House of the Edain over the Blue Mountains and into the
fair Beleriand.
