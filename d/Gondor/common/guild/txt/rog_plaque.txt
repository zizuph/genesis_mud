                             Drop Room Policy
                                   of the
                             Rangers of Gondor

    We are deeply grateful for any and all freewill contributions you
    make to aid us in our struggle against Evil.  To help us preserve
    as much as possible during an impending visitation by Armageddon,
    we ask that you follow these few simple guidelines:

    1. Always return items borrowed (or a replacement of higher
       value) to the Drop Rooms here or one of the other hideouts.
    2. Put any herb donations in the jar and close it.
    3. Put any glowing items in the appropriate rack.  It helps speed up
       our sorting later if items which fail to glow are left in the crate.
    4. Please leave nothing on the floor here in the west drop room.

    If you are pulling Drop Room duty in preparation for Armageddon's
    visit, please use the following priorities:

    1. Never face Armageddon carrying more than you are capable of
       without a pack - the extra weight the pack allows will be lost.
    2. Retrieve the herbs from the emergency jar first, as they always glow.
    3. Retrieve high value weapons (splendid swords or better) second.
    4. Retrieve high value armours (plated or better) third.
    5. Retrieve potions from the east barracks room.

    Past experience has shown that no matter how benign the intent, the
    selling of equipment removed from the Drop Room inevitably leads to
    accusations and interminable explanations far exceeding the mere cash
    value of the item sold.  To avoid the possibility of a misunderstanding,
    consider anything in the barracks and Drop Room as community 
    property -- free for all Rangers to borrow and return, but NEVER to
    be sold unless replaced with equipment of equal or greater value.
