Commands:

- resign
    Resign as a Captain of the Rangers.
    The resignation will automatically call for an election of a new Captain.

- nominate
    Nominate a ranger as candidate in the election for a new Captain of that
    ranger's company.
    If no election has yet been called for that company, this command will call
    the election for the ranger's company.
    It is impossible to nominate a ranger while there is a Captain of that 
    ranger's company.
