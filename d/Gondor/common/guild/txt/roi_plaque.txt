              Armoury Policy of the Rangers of Ithilien

 We are deeply grateful for any and all freewill contributions you make
 to aid us in our struggle against Evil.  Please observe the following
 guidelines in order to keep our Armoury efficient and well organized:

 Organization:
    1. Glowing weapons and armours are placed in this chamber.
    2. Weapons and armours which fail to glow are placed in the chamber
       immediately west of here.
    3. Emergency herbs and potions are kept in the rock chamber to the
       southeast, where the food stores are kept.
    4. All other miscellaneous items are placed north of here next to
       the bulletin board.
         
 Emergency herbs and potions:
    1. The emergency herb jar should contain at least 12, but no more
       than 24, of each of these herbs: athelas, attanar, lothore, and 
       suranie. Herbs other than those mentioned here, or those in 
       excess of the limits mentioned, should be placed with the 
       miscellaneous items instead.
    2. A supply of emergency potions, consisting of at least 10 clear
       potions and 6 purple potions, should be kept in a leather 
       satchel and placed next to the emergency herb jar.

 Etiquette:
    1. Every Ithilien Ranger should check the emergency supplies and
       make sure they are well stocked before proceeding on patrols.
    2. Always return borrowed items to the chambers here in Henneth Annun.
    3. Armoury supplies are never to be sold under any circumstances.

 Armageddon:
    1. Never use a backpack to try to carry more items through Armageddon.
    2. Retrieve the herbs and potions from the emergency stock first,
       glowing weapons and armours second, and miscellaneous items last.
    3. Non-glowing weapons and armours are left for Armageddon to take.
       They are to be ignored.  They are never to be sold.
