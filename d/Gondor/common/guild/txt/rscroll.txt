                             Welcome, Ranger!
                             ================
      You have now been accepted as a Ranger pupil. This will provide
      you with a set of new commands, listed when you type 'help ranger'.
      You will have a ring you can wear, which is the membership-token of
      the Rangers of Gondor. If you lose it, go and ask for a new in the
      Hall of Rangers, where you signed your name in the book.
      The Rangers of Gondor are a merry, but somewhat secret organization,
      working as scouts and spies for Gondor, and each Ranger should thus
      be careful about what to tell others about it.

      In the near future you will be allowed to choose a branch within the
      Rangers, or rather a Company - each operating in different areas.

      A Ranger has become a valuable asset to every party of adventurers, so
      if you feel inadequate on your own, seek company with others - most
      will be glad to join a Ranger.

                  Good luck with your Ranger-future!
