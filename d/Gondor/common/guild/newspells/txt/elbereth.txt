	 Ways of Warding against Undead
	/------------------------------/

Elbereth, the Starkindler, is one of the most revered of the Valar,
being the wife of Manwe, and the Valie who put the stars in the sky,
providing the Firstborn with the light they needed. Even after the
Coming of the Sun and the Moon, the power of Varda is appreciated by
the Free Peoples, and feared by the minions of Evil. And to those who
are but lifeless souls controlled by the Dark Lord, the mere name of
Elbereth Gilthoniel creates terror they cannot control. With the wave
of a burning torch, and a praise to Elbereth on the lips of the caster,
even the feared Nazgul may despair, and even flee before him.
