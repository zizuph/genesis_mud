	Ways of Communing
       /-----------------/

Communication by normal means is a slow ordeal. The message must often
travel many hundred leagues to reach the recipient, and the messenger
may fall to many kinds of dangers on the way, or travel long and
delaying detours to bring the message safely through. When the method
of using carrier pigeons was discovered, messages could be dispatched
much more quickly than before, for pigeons travel swiftly through the
air, high above most dangers, and in straight lines to their known
target. Rangers soon adopted this method of communing, to ensure a
good intelligence network for their organization. The white carrier
pigeons have almost become a symbol of their struggle against evil,
and are used with great success every day.
