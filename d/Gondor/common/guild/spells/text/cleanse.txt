	 Ways of Cleansing
	/-----------------/

Through corruption the Evil One has long sought to conquer the
Good. By turning beautiful flowers into poisonous plants, or twisting
innocent snakes to become poisonous adders, one of the nastiest
methods to kill a man has been found. Though poisons work in a variety
of ways, from causing a quick death to long, excruciatingly painful
sicknesses before death comes as a relief, most can be cured. For
since the Corruption begun, the Firstborn, and later also Men have
sought ways to cleanse away the poisons again. Often the method comes
from the gardens of Yavanna, from herbs and flowers growing in the
wilds. This prayer was developed to try to use the virtue of such
herbs to cleanse a poisoned body. The chance is very small that it
will succeed without such an ingredient.
