	 Ways of Healing
	/---------------/

Since the first days of the Kingdoms in Exile, the healers of
Middle-earth have known of the healing virtues of the flower known as
Lothore. The Sindar elves of Eregion and later Lorien discovered this
gift of Yavanna, healing power in the form of a red, heart-shaped
flower. They learned to extract this power by prayer, and to apply it
to the hurts and wounds of their loved ones, and later shared their
wisdom with the Dunedain. Practiced mostly in the South Kingdom, this
prayer was almost lost when Ithilien fell under the Evil Shadow in the
twenty-first century of the Third Age, and Lothore became a rare
sight. But with the Rise of Evil, the need for opposition also arose,
and the Rangers of Gondor were founded, grasping the scolarship of
their ancestors, and preserving the prayers and spells of old.
