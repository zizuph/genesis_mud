	 Ways of Growth
	/--------------/

Yavanna, Giver of Fruits, is the spirit of all plants and
flowers. Through her labors, the World is covered with green growths
and nutritious fruits. Herb-gathering people often pray to Yavanna for
her to bless their foraging grounds, and at times this prayer will
have a chance to bring quicker growth to virtuous plants like herbs.
