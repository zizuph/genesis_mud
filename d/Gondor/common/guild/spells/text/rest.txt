	 Ways of Resting
	/---------------/

The world is large, and travels across it take both time and
strength. On their journeys, the first Rangers discovered that fatigue
was the main reason that slows down a journey, for resting from
weariness is time-consuming. 

The virtue of the redweed-herb was discovered by Rangers who delved
into the problem with fatigue, and they found that with a prayer to
Orome, the resting virtue of the redweed could be conjured to remove a
little fatigue. This has later become quite popular with any
far-travelling Ranger of the Westlands.
