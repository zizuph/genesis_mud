The story teller

This npc will be located in the song_room.

His function will be to answer questions concerning songs and old lore.
The legends he knows will mainly be from the history of the Dunedain.
In the legends hints for quests can be hidden.

In his capacity as loremaster he will also know all the names of
the North rangers. (Players has requested this for quite some time.) 

Another idea is to let players record their own songs to him.
I don't want this to be too similar to the minstrels ability,
so I'll let this idea rest for a while.
