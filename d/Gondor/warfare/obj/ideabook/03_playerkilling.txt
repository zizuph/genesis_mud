Ideas for the War System of Middle Earth - Player Killing
---------------------------------------------------------

It's not unlikely that this system will increase the number of Player versus
Player fights. As not all of the guilds are equally well equipped to combat
their natural adversaries, a system of death protection has been proposed, 
where, when actively involved in the war efforts, one would be protected from
player caused deaths within that specific area. This however will not make
you immortal, yet, when near death, you will be rendered unconcious and be
captured by the opposing party, being transfered to their dungeons, where you
would spend an <x> number of hours of either play time, or real time until 
you manage to escape. For those unwilling to wait, there will be the option
to forfeit your life, much as what would have occured had the protection not
been in place.

An idea has already been presented, where friends could mount a rescue 
operation to extract the prisoner and thus shorten his capture.
