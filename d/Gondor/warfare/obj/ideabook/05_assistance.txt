Ideas for the War System of Middle Earth - Assistance
-----------------------------------------------------

Obviously some thought already went into the system, and input has already 
been given by many parties. Yet, it's very possible that you have some
concerns or ideas that have yet to make it into this tome. For that 
specific purpose, a board has been placed within this room, so you can 
voice your opinion, or if you prefer the more private approach, a mail can
be send to Eowul. The contents of this book will be updated as the 
discussion continues, until a point in the future has been reached where
the majority is happy with the idea as it stands.
