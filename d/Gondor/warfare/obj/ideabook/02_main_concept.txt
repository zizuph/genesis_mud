Ideas for the War System of Middle Earth - The Concept
------------------------------------------------------

Most of you will be aware of the warfare system as it exists within the lands
of Krynn. While we obviously aim to offer something unique to Middle Earth, 
the general idea will be the same. Middle Earth will be devided into various
conquerable areas, which will be filled with the units of the owning army, 
that means forces of Gondor or something more suitable in case the area is 
controlled by those siding with the West, or orcs, uruk-hai and haradrim when
the Dark Lord is in control.

The guilds of Middle Earth will have their side pre-determined, but those that
do not belong to any of these guilds, will have to ability to pledge their
allegiance at various points within the domain, and thus help out the side of
their choosing.

Once the opposing forces in an area have been slain, it will be possible to
conquer the area, turning control over to the other side. This will cause
reinforcements to arrive, and slowly take control of the region. 

There will be various ways for players to assist with the reinforcement, by
conquering and controlling areas located next to the newly conquered region,
by providing monetary funds to recruit more soldiers and by providing 
equipment that will be used by the army. 

It is the intention to offer unique features/rewards for the various areas
conquered, things like controlling the boat at the Osgiliath bridge, allowing
the owning faction only to use it, or by providing strategical services that
would allow the conquering army to advance further and faster, such as a 
healer. 

Initially the intention is to start with the region of Ithilien, for it is 
already quite prepared to be held by two different forces, only now it will
no longer be controlled by the timeline, but rather by the players. 

The list of areas that will be added to the system is not yet created, but it
could possibly include villages like Bree and Pelargir, but may very well also
allow you to conquer the main cities of the opposing force such as Minas 
Tirith and Minas Morgul.
