Ideas for the War System of Middle Earth - Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------

This tome is intended as a collection of thoughts, ideas and plans for the
creation of a warfare system within the domain of Middle Earth. The main
objective is to provide something that's fun, and gives the guilds of 
Middle Earth a reason to actually participate in the struggle between East
and West. As indicated, this is a work in progress, and the reason it's
presented here is to obtain feedback on the ideas presented, so that we
will eventually end up with a system that's interesting to all parties 
involved. However, even though feedback is requested, only constructive 
feedback that offers ideas / solutions, rather than just saying 'this 
sucks' will be accepted. Notes that violate this will be removed from the 
board.
