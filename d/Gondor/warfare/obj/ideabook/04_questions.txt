Ideas for the War System of Middle Earth - Questions and Answers
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Currently Middle Earth is controlled by a timeline, will this remain so?

  A great many of things are tied in to the timeline, as such, there will
  definately not be an immediate removal, if at all. However, those areas
  that have been transfered to the war system will no longer be under the
  effects of the timeline, but rather have their destiny shaped by the 
  actions of the players.
  
* It was proposed that the system might be extended to include Minas Tirith
  and Minas Morgul. Would this not cause issues for players that start their
  day within that city, and thus possibly awake within a region of enemy
  NPC's?
  
  For those specific areas, the NPCs will start out as non aggressive, that
  is, if they aren't supposed to be their historically, unless they are
  provoked by the player, after which all bets are off. This means, that if
  orcs hold Minas Tirith, any good aligned player will be able to walk 
  around within fear of being attacked, and similar to the forces of Gondor
  holding Minas Morgul, where mages can walk around safely.
