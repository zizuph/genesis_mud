Jain's Sword Quest

The quest begins above the sleeping stallion in Edoras.
Jaine wants her father's sword returned. The Dunlendings stole it.

The player needs to go to the dunlending area, find the meadow rooms.
There is a 1/3 chance that the meadows will spawn a tent. Inside the tent there are invisible crates. There's a 1/100 chance that the quest sword will appear in the crates. 

Once you get the sword, return it to jaine for a reward.

The purpose of the quest is to keep players engaged in the Dunlending area, and to ensure that they take the time to look for the tents and explore them.
