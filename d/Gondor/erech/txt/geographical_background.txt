The rejected preliminary of `The March of Aragorn and the defeat 
    of the Haradrim' SD pp 14-17

I have mentioned (pp8-9) that on the reverse of the page bearing outline 
IV (describing the capture and rescue of Frodo) is the original form of 
the outline given in VIII.397-9, entitled `The march of Aragorn and the 
defeat of the Haradrim'. This is a very puzzling text, and I give it in 
full. It was infact written in three forms. The first is a pencilled test
(a) as follows:

    Aragorn takes Path of the Dead early on March 8th. Comes out of the 
  tunnel (a grievous road) and reaches head of Vale of of Morthond at 
  dusk. He blows horns [struck out: and unfurls standard] to amazement of 
  the people; who acclaim [him] as a king risen from the Dead. He rests 
  three hours abd bidding all to follow and send out the war-arrows he
  rides for the Stone of Erech. This is a stone set op between the mouths
  of Lamedui and the Ethir Anduin delta to commemorate the landing of Isildur
  and Anarion. It is about 275 miles by road from the issuing of the Path
  of the Dead. Aragorn rides 100 miles and reaches the Ringol Vale (where
  men are assembling) on March 9. There he gathers news and men. He rides
  after a short rest into Lamedon (10) and goes to

Here this version was abandoned and a new start made, also in pencil, at 
`Aragorn takes Paths of the Dead'; but this text (b) was overwritten in ink
and can only be read here and there. The overwritten form (c) reads thus:

    Aragorn takes Paths of the Dead morn(ing) 8 March, passes tunnels of
  of the mountains and comes out into the head of Morthond Vale at dusk.
  Men of the Dale are filled with fear for it seems to them that behind 
  the dark shapes of the living ridersa great host of shadowy men come 
  nearly as swift as riders. Aragorn goes on through night and reaches
  Stone of Erech at morn(ing) on March 9. Stone of Erech was black stone
  fabled to have been brought from Numenor, and set to mark the landing of 
  Isildur and Anaroin and their receptions as kings by dark men of the land.
  It stood on the shore of Cobas, near the outflow of Morthond, and about 
  it was a ruined wall within which was also a ruined tower. In the vault 
  under the tower forgotten was one of the Palantir[i]. From Erech a road 
  ran by [the] sea, skirting in a loop the hills of Tarnost, and so to
  Ethir Andiun and the Lebennin.
    At Stone of Erech Aragorn unfurls his standard (Isildur's) with white
  crown and star and Tree ans blows horns. Men come to him. (The Shadow-men 
  cannot be seen by day.) Aragorn learns that what he saw in Palentir was 
  true indeed: Men of Harad have landed on the coast near Ethir, and their 
  ships have sailed up the estuary as far as Pelargir. There the men of 
  Lebennin have made a block - on the basis of an ancient defence. The 
  Haradwaith are ravaging the land. It is nearly 350 miles by coast road
  from Erech to Pelargir. Aragorn sends out swift riders north into the
  Dales, summoning what men remain to march on Pelargir. He does not
  himself take coast-road, since it isinfested, but after a rest he sets out 
  at dusk of March 9 - and goes like wind by rough paths over Linhir and so 
  to Ford of Lameduin (about 150 miles away). The Shadow Host is seen to 
  follow. He crosses Morthond at Linhir, passess into Ringlo Vale, and sets
  all land aflame for war. He reaches Lameduin evening March 10. Men are 
  assembling there, and are resisting an attempt of the Haradwaith to cross 
  Lebennin > NW. Aragorn and the Shadow Host come out of the dark with the 
  white star shining on the banner and the Haradwaith are terrified. Many 
  drowned in the river Lameduin. Aragorn camps and crosses Lameduin into 
  Lebennin and marches on Pelargir morn(ing) of March 11. The terror of 
  `the Black King' precedes him, and the Haradwaith try to fly: some ships
  escape down Anduin, but Aragorn comes up driving Haradwaith before him. 
  The Shadow Host camps on shore of Anduin before Pelargir on evening of 
  March 11th. By night they set fire on guarded ships, destroy Haradwaith
  and capture 2 vessels. On morn(ing) of 12th they set out up Anduin with 
  Haradwaith captains rowing.

The extraordinary thing about this, of course, is the site of Erech. It seems
plain beyond any question from all the evidence presented in `The War of the
Ring' (see especially the chapter `Many Roads Lead Eastward (1)') that from 
its first emergence Erech was in the southern foothills of Ered Nimrais, near
the source of Morthond: Erech stands self-evedetly in close relationship with
the Paths of Dead. Why then did my father now move it, first (in a) to the
coast between the mouths of Lameduin and Ethir Anduin, and then (in b and c)
to Cobas Haven (north of Dol Amroth: see the Second Map, VIII.434)? I am 
unable to propose any explanation.
  The geography of the c-version is at first sight hard to follow. In a
Aragorn's route can be understood: all that is said here is that he rode
from the head of Morthond Vale `for the Stone of Erech'; he reaches the
Ringol Vale, and then continues into Lamedon (which at this stage lay east
of the river Lameduin: see VIII.437). The dustance of 275 miles from th issuing
of the Path of the Dead to Erech `between the mouth of Lamedui and and the
Ethir Anduin' is however much too great, and was perhaps an error for 175. (On
the form Lamedui see VIII.436.) In versionc, however, Aragorn leaves Erech
`between the shores of Cobas, near the outflow of Morthond', and `goes like
a wind by rough paths over Linhir and so to Fords of Lameduin (about 150
miles away). ... He crosses Morthond at Linhir, passes into Ringol Vale ...
He reaches Lameduin.' As it stands this makes no sense; but the explanation 
is that his journay is described twice in the same passage. The first 
statement is comprised in the words `He goes like wind by rough paths over
Linhir, and so to Ford Lameduin (about 150 mile).' The second statement is `He
crossess Morthond at Linhir, passes into Ringol Vale ... He reaches Lameduin.'
This must mean that Linhir is here in the earlier position, above Cobas Haven
(see VIII.437).
   It is said in c that the coast road from Erech skirted in a loop `the Hills
of Tarnost'. This name is written in pencil against a dot on the square Q 12
of the Second Map, at the northern extremity of the hills between the river
Lameduin and Ringol (see VIII.434, 437, where I said that so far I then knew 
the name Tarnost does not occur elsewhere).
   Lastly, in the concluding lines of B, which were not overwritten, the name Haradrians is given to the Haradwaith.
