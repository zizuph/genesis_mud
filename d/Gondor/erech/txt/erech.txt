Erech (Du. ``PLace of Terror'')
  Erech is the Dunael name given to the hill where Isildur caused the King of 
the Mountains to swear alligiance to him in S.A. 3320. The hill, which lies at
the of the Mornann, acquired its name some years after the Oathbreaking (which 
took place in S.A. 3434), when the Dead begoan to haunt the grounds 
surrounding the Covenant Stone upon which Morthac's oath had been sworn. Both 
the hill, and the fields surrounding it are avoided by all, and no animal 
will approach it willingly. Only the Prince of Mornan, when one of the 
Gwaendhil, had no fear of the place. In T.A 3019, Aragorn II summoned the Dead
to the Stone of Erech to fulfill their oath, after which time the hill ceased 
to be haunted (though the common folk still shunned it).
