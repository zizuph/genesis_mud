The domain Gondor is based on J.R.R.Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'.  
The domain covers the areas of Gondor, Ithilien, Rohan and Dunland, geographically trying to follow the books closely.
Opened areas: Anorien, Ithilien, the Plains of Rohan, Fangorn Forest, Lebennin, the cities of Minas Tirith, Pelargir, Minas Morgul and Edoras, the ruins of Osgiliath, and of Fornost. Also hidden somewhere in Gondor are the guild of the Rangers of the Westlands, and the Morgul Mages. The domain also contains a layman guild for the Militia of Thornlin, a race guild for dwarves, the Rockfriends, the first 'frozen' guild in Genesis, and a race guild for humans, the Dunedain.
If you are interested in contributing to Tolkien's world, inquire with the Liege.
