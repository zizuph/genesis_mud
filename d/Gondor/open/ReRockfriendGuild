Greetings,

In reaction to questions of some of the newer members of the domain Gondor,
the following request. Since I opened the Rockfriend guild in december 1993,
I have been its guildmaster, along with the respective Lord of Gondor, for
he is the ultimate deity in the domain. This started with Aragorn, son of
Arathorn, chieftain of the Dunedain of Arnor, Captain of the Host of the
West, bearer of the Star of the North, wielder of the Sword Reforged,
victorious in battle, whose hands bring healing, the Elfstone, King and
Lord of Gondor, Elessar Telcontar of the line of Valandil, Isildur's son,
Elendil's son of Numenor! After that, Olorin Annatar of the Red Eye gave
his assistance and now Gorboth carries the torch.

I would appreciate it if all reports related to the Rockfriend guild were
forwarded to me. After doing that, you can delete them from the log. Fixing
a typo or a serious bug that needs immediate care is always fine, but I do
appreciate being kept up to speed for I keep a 'master copy' of the guild
at home and I do not want to over-write your changes.

Thanks,

Mercade
