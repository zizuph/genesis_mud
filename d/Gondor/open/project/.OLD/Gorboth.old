Gorboth is Lord of Gondor, making him the third to hold the station
after Elessar who was first, and Olorin who was second.

Gorboth is working on the hilly region of the Emyn Muil, which will
include the areas described in "The Breaking of the Fellowship." The
Lake of Nen Hithoel with its surrounding hillsides, the slopes of the
Emyn Muil, and the Anduin as it flows south over the Rauros falls will
all be included as well as the three peaks of Amon Hen, Amon Sul, and
Tol Brandir.

Naturally, there will be quests.
