Fysix' projects

First project:
        coding steeds that can be ridden.
Date:   May 1997
Dir:    /d/Gondor/std/steed/
Status: steeds that can have one single rider are currently in the
        game. The Krynn knights (Morrigan) and
        some transportation creature in Avenir uses it (Cirion).
        I'm now working on getting multiple rider steeds to work.
        There were some troubles with teaming and riding at the
        same time. Also I should look into paying the fee when
        boarding ships when mounted.

Second project:
        boats used for transport in Gondor.
Date:   July 1997
Dir:    /d/Gondor/std/boat/
Status: boats are working. They haven't been used yet, so some
        details might have to be worked out.

Third project:
        Riders of Rohan.
Date:   September 1997
Dir:    /d/Gondor/rohan/edoras/?
Status: The ideas are there. I'll be coding it along while I get
        the multiple rider steeds fixed.
