The domain Gondor is based on J.R.R.Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'.  

The domain covers the areas of Gondor, Ithilien, Rohan and Dunland,
geographically trying to follow the books closely.
 
Opened areas: Anorien, Ithilien, the Plains of Rohan, Lebennin, the
cities of Minas Tirith, Pelargir, Minas Morgul and Edoras, the ruins
of Osgiliath, and of Fornost. Also hidden somewhere in Gondor are the
guild of the Rangers of the Westlands, and the Society of Morgul
Mages. The domain also contains a race guild for dwarves, the
Rockfriends, the first 'frozen' guild in Genesis, and a race guild for
humans, the Houses of the Dunedain.

If you are interested in contributing to Tolkien's world, inquire with
Olorin. 

The domain Gondor is based on "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. 
Tolkien. If you have read those books and enjoyed them, Gondor is the
perfect domain for you! 

If you are not a Tolkien afficionado or if you never even heard about
Tolkien and his works, do not despair! Gondor has large areas that
Tolkien never managed to describe, like large parts of Mordor, the Black
Land, home of orcs and other evil creatures, wide areas south of the
White Mountains and west of the Gap of Rohan, where you can let your
imagination run wild! 

The domain Gondor consists of the kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor. 
Presently, there are three major cities: Minas Tirith, capital of
Gondor, Edoras, capital of Rohan, and Minas Morgul, the chief city of
the evil ringwraiths. The domain has three guilds open to mortals: the
Rangers of the Westlands, the Society of Morgul Mages, the Houses of the
Dunedain, and the Rockfriends.
