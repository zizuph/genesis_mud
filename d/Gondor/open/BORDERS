The borders of the domain Gondor in Genesis are:
Starting from the west:
  Somewhere across Minhiriath, between Baranduin and Gwathlo/Greyflood
going northeast from the coast to meet the Greenway just south
of the fork to Sarn Ford.
  From there north of the Greenway southeast to the confluence of
Mitheithel and Glanduin.
  From there eastward along the Glanduin to the Misty Mountains.
  Crossing the Misty Mountains between the sources of the Glanduin and
the source of the Nimrodel.
  Northward at the feet of the mountains to the southeastern end of the
Mirrormere, crossing the Celebrant there, and going eastward at the
northern border of Lorien to the Anduin.
  Going south along the Anduin to the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings,
at the entry to the Nen Hithoel.
  From the Argonath along the northern feet of the Emyn Muil
northeastward, then north of the Death Marshes and the Dagorlad in a
straight line eastward.
  Where a line going straight east from the northern feet of the
Emyn Muil meets a line going straight north from Barad-dur, the border
turns south till the Erad Lithui.
  Then eastward along the northern feet of the Ered Lithui.
  From the eastern end of the Ered Lithui southward to the mountain range
south of the Sea of Nurnen.
  South of that mountain range westward to the river Harnen.
  Along the river Harnen to the coast.
