Dear P.

Our long awaited meeting is drawing nearer, but my superiours and
I will need more concise information before we start.
If you could inform us whom we are likely to meet on the way, and where,
the master will surely show himself very grateful.
He especially asked me to inquire about the green men on the other
side of the river.

    D.
