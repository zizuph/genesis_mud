Cities of Gondor
<UL>
<LI>Edoras--Located on the sweeping plains of Rohan, Edoras is the capital 
city of the Rohirrim. 
<LI>Minas Tirith--The last stronghold of the Numenoreans
against the growing evil in Mordor. Here you may find many of the amenities
of civilization, such as an armourer, weapon dealer, herbalist, jewelry shop,
and a nice inn. Visit Hunthor to find tasks.
<LI>Minas Morgul--Beware the watchful Eye if you venture to this city.
<LI>Pelargir--In Pelargir, a harbour town, you can catch a ship to all areas of
the realms and find Lord Councillor Carastur who dispenses quests.
The Dunedain guild is located here as well as the Storytellers Club.
