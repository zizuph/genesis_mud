Gondor

Gondor is a land with a deep history, where once the great heroes of Numenor 
fought alongside elves and other races to defeat the evil of Sauron.  The 
heroes are dead and forgotten.  Much has been lost, kept alive only in the 
memory of long-lived elves, tales of wise women, and indecipherable scrolls.

But still in the waning Evendim of Numenor, the hope of the West burns bright 
and true.  Equally fierce is the growing challenge of the Shadow in the East. 
Mirroring each other across the River Anduin, the twin towers of Minas Tirith 
and Minas Morgul struggle for dominance.  While in the far North, the memory of 
the Light yet lives in Arnor, and Carn Dum still recoils under the whip 
of the Witch King and his Angmarim. Who will win this war, good or evil?
