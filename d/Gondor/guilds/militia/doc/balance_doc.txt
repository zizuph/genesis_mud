           FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING BALANCE AND TAXATION

Guild Overview and Purpose (Taken from original draft proposal)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have all seen Thornlin on a newbie tour, and gone to their militia
house.  Yet the area has remained fairly non-descript, and little-used
by other than herbalists, and with some reason.  Neither Tolkien has
ever really had anything to say about the area, so we will have to use
a bit of imagination to give the place any detail or character.  The 
militia, the pig and the araw are what we associate Thornlin with, 
and nobody wants a guild based on livestock.

With no real statements from the Tolkiens about the area, I am filling
in the gaps a little as follows: several generations ago, when the area
was less populated, a bell would be used to call together volunteers
who would grab whatever weapon-like things might be handy and run to
the village marketplace, to ward off wolves or other troublemakers.
By the stewardship of Mardil, the village had become a fairly prosperous
town, but the lenghtening absence of the King was a cause for worry.
An official, said by the locals to be a member of the steward's
household, stopped by on his way towards Pelargir to talk to the locals
about the gravity of the situation, the growing dangers of the countryside,
and the inability of the Gondorian army to keep watch far from the walled
cities.  From this speech was born the Thornlin militia.

Like the militias of townsmen and free farmers in Europe (e.g the Swiss,
the Scots), they use polearms so as to be able to defend themselves
from whatever comes along, whether it be a wild boar or a band of
brigands on horseback.  The spear is also a popular weapon for hunting,
so many are already comfortable with it.  They tend to wear light armour
because it impedes their speed and mobility little, and is quite adequate
against their usual foes -- not that they could afford platemail and 
warhorses if they wanted them.  If they encounter a better-equipped fighting
force, they can still retreat into a defensive circle and do reasonably
well (assuming no archers).  Should the force be overwhelming, they
will retreat into the mountains that encircle them, where no horseman
may attack them uphill with any confidence.

Because they are a town militia and not a branch of the army of Gondor,
they do not have anything much in the way of hierarchy or internal
politics.  Only a few rules, and no officers.  One must not fall under
the influence of Sauron (maintain alignment sufficient to enter Minas
Tirith, it would seem totally wrong to me for the Militia to be
attacked at the gates), no orcs, hobgoblins, trolls or other foul
races need apply, none who have ever attacked the town may apply,
and attacking Rangers, Gondorian soldiers, Heralds of the Valar, or
guildmates will not be tolerated.  Neither will protracted
association with Sauron's servants.  This is, after all, a small,
voluntary association whose only real interest is the town's safety.
(I may have overlooked something that will need to be added to this
list, but I have no intention of getting involved in things like
whether or not they are outlawed by any guild, get in fights
with members of guilds outside of ME, etc.)

Now to say a little bit about why I want to code this... since the
closing of the AA, there has been rather a lack of appealing lay
guild options of the fighter type.  Monks have an application
process that can be lengthy, and roleplaying them harmoniously
along with an occupational guild can be very hard.  The Smiths
offer only mild combat advantages, and the Blademasters are not
an option for most characters.

Many have complained about guilds taking forever to join, being
highly politicized, drawn into permanent wars, etc.  They would
like to be able to go out and have fun without being hunted, or
trying to follow their council's latest strange ruling, or being
killed in one's start room as a suspected chest looter, etc.
This is meant to be useful for those who belong to occupational
guilds with weak combat skills, as well as those who do not
forsee (or want) joining an occupational guild soon.  It should
be easy to roleplay for those who are so inclined, and not in
conflict with roleplaying any occ guild, since outlandish types
are generally acceptable as hired reinforcements... a monk/militia
would be no stranger than the Vikings hired by Byzantium, or the
Goths working for the Roman Empire.

Because this guild is meant to be relatively safe and carefree,
I am intending to give it fairly strong defensive capabilities,
but only enough offense to allow the otherwise guildless to
be able to grow some -- and not enough to make it a very 
attractive choice for pfighters.

Combat Specials:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Jab
  ~~~
    Files: /d/Gondor/guilds/militia/specials/jab.c
    
    Jab is a fairly standard damage special for a layman. Thematically,
    because the Thornlin Militia uses farmer tools (polearms) to fight,
    they are able to effective jab at their opponents using the training
    that they've received while in the militia.
            
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
    and all other calculations are set. Jab has been set to be at
    combat aid of 42%.

    ** Modified to 40% caid following global balance review
    ** -Arman Kharas (AoB) August 2019
        
    Frequency
    ---------
    Jab is a fairly fast special, with a internal of 14 seconds. 
    The actual time is randomized when using the Genesis specials library.
    
    Hit chance
    ----------
    Tohit is set to be 110. This is calculated to be 90% hit chance
    according to 'man cb_tohit'.
    
    Penetration
    -----------
    Penetration is calculated using the person's strength, dexterity, and
    wisdom for the stats portion, and the Militia Tactics skill for the
    skill portion of it. Of course, penetration also depends on the
    weapon's pen.

    Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
    
    Drawbacks
    ---------
    Jab cannot be used at the same time as the Militia Evade.
    
  Militia Evade
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Files: /d/Gondor/guilds/militia/specials/militia_evade.c
    
    Militia evade uses the new Genesis Evade Special. A person in the
    militia during battle can choose to focus on evading incoming
    attacks. This is a useful ability, but since it takes so much 
    focus and concentration, the person evading cannot focus on
    an attack such as jab at the same time. Each evade attempt lasts
    for average of 18 seconds, after which the Militia person has
    to either restart his evade, or jab instead. I kept this model
    from the original guild since I felt that this would help to
    enhance playability when one has to make constant decisions
    on what to do next, rather than an automatic evade ability
    like other occupational guilds.
            
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
    and all other calculations are set. Evade has been set to be at
    combat aid of 42%.

    ** Modified to 40% caid following global balance review
    ** -Arman Kharas (AoB) August 2019
        
    Frequency
    ---------
    The evade ability lasts for average of 18 seconds upon each
    invocation. The actual time is random, similar to other abilities
    based on the central library.
    

  Impale
  ~~~~~~
    File: /d/Gondor/guilds/militia/specials/impale_attack.c
    
    The impale ability is an instant special that is executed when
    a person of the militia is attacked and they are wielding a
    polearm and trained in the Impale skill. The instant special
    has a cooldown period of 2 minutes. It has a combat aid of 3%
    based on this long cooldown period (24 rounds). This translates
    to 72% combat aid being set in the combat special impale_attack.c
    
    The purpose of this special is more as a way to deter attacks on
    militia since in general, those in the Militia have lower combat
    abilities than real fighters. The idea is very similar to the Red 
    Dragonarmy auto-impale, where an attacker will get impaled for 
    a limited time when attacking. The difference is that it only does 
    damage, and does not do any stunning.
    
    Combat Aid
    ----------
    Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
    and all other calculations are set. Impale has been set to be at
    combat aid of 3%.

    Frequency
    ---------
    Impale is an instant special, with no preparation time. It has a
    cooldown period of 120 seconds, during which it cannot be used
    again.
    
    Hit chance
    ----------
    Tohit is set to be 110. This is calculated to be 90% hit chance
    according to 'man cb_tohit'.
    
    Penetration
    -----------
    Penetration is calculated using the person's strength, dexterity, and
    wisdom for the stats portion, and the Militia Impale skill for the
    skill portion of it. Of course, penetration also depends on the
    weapon's pen.

    Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
