After Calmacil the Kings took the sceptre in names of the Numenorean or Adunaic tongue: 
Ar-Adunakhor, Ar-Zimrathon, Ar-Sakalthor, Ar-Gimilzor, Ar-Inziladun. 
Inziladun repented of the ways of the Kings and changed his name to Tal-Palantir 'The Farsighted'. 
His daughter should have been the fourth Queen, Tar-Miriel, but the Kings nephew usurped the sceptre 
and became Ar-Pharazon the Golden, last King of the Numenoreans.
