_________//========== The Black Numenoreans, and overview ==========\\__________
          ___________________________________________________________


A member joins the guild at the Captain of the black ship. He/she will remain 
without a house until he reaches the title Envoy. At this point the player can 
enter a house, without a Lord/Lady, at the Captain or talk to the Lord/Lady of 
the desired house to join.

A houseless player never reach further then to Envoy and a Lord/Lady can not 
kick a player from the guild as a whole, only from the House.
(Add 'disgraced' to the title for kicked players for a set time, or perhaps
ability to kick a player in three degrees? Ban <member> light/medium/heavy
this would set a different timer on disgraced title and a random of course.)

Once a player advances up to Baron/Baroness of Numenor he/she is eligible to
try to become a Lord/Lady of a house. To reach this title there is a small 
task and for each level up this shall be the case.

The title is based on guildstat (15%) and on eligible kills (85%) in Middle Earth
and rare kills outside Middle Earth.
When joining a house the kill count for next title will be set to 0 and the value
it was saved in the player file (bnumen.o). Since once in a house the players
rank can not fall below Envoy. (Here some fine tunement might be needed, reset or
keep the score when the player joined and then count the difference?)

In effect of above a player only mindlessly killing for rank will never reach 
the title of Envoy and those who do understand the system will spend more
time in Middle Earth. Hints of this should be found in the guild from NPC and
in help files for the guild.
