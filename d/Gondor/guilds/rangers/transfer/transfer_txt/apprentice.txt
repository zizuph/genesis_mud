                      ~~ Apprentices ~~

Former Pupils will now have the title of "Apprentice." There is a
time limit to how long you can remain an apprentice (three months).
If an apprentice does not become a full ranger by the end of the time
period, he/she will be removed from the guild and will need to reapply.

Upon entering the door that will transform a Pupil to Apprentice,
the clock will start ticking.

After the required time period during which an apprentice must prove
him/herself, the apprentice will become an "Approved Apprentice."

At that time a vote will be initiated among the rangers as to whether
the apprentice is deemed worthy to be accepted into the guild and to
which company they will be assigned.

Pupils may enter the <apprentice> tunnel or they may <abandon hope>.
