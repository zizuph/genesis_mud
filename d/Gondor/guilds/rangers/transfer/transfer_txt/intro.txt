                       ~~ General Information ~~

Rangers have returned to Arnor. There are now two companies, the Rangers of 
Ithilien and Rangers of the North. Apprentices (formerly pupils) will guard
the old guildhouse of Gondor until such time as they are accepted into one
of the companies. The Rangers of Gondor are no more.

All full rangers, including former company leaders, have a right
to choose that company where they will feel most at home. In order to make 
an informed choice, you must read and think on the differences between the 
companies.  This book gives you information on the skills and other 
differences between companies. Once your selection is made, changing your 
mind will not be easy.  

For Apprentices (formerly Pupils), there is only one choice: 
To leave or to stay. If you should decide to leave, there will be 
no penalty in loss of experience, however, you will lose the skills
that you have learned from the Rangers.  If you stay, you will be 
required to complete several tasks as an apprentice, then apply to
a company. See the chapters on apprenticeship for more information.

For full rangers, the choices are more arduous. You may choose either
to join the Rangers of the North or the Rangers of Ithilien. You may
also choose to leave the guild, but you will lose the skills that you
have been taught from the Master Ranger.

The first order of business once rangers have selected their companies is to 
nominate and elect leadership for the North and for Ithilien. Respective
company members, full rangers, will be able to elect their leadership.

After you have made your selections, be sure to read all help files. 
While some things have changed, much will feel very familiar. 

There is no easy path, and each way is beset by danger from the Enemy
on all sides. Choose wisely.
