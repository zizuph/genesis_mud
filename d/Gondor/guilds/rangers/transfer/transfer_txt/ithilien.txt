              ~~ Rangers of Ithilien ~~
                   
Across the great river Anduin from Minas Tirith is found the beautiful
yet dangerous forest of Ithilien. Occupied by the armies of Mordor
since the fall of Osgiliath, this land is not a place for the timid.
Fighting from hidden places in the forest are the Rangers of Ithilien,
descendants of the free peoples who once dwelt there in peace. Led by
the second son of the Steward, these brave rangers are freedom-fighters
ambushing orc and haradrim patrols to devastating effect and then
fading into the trees once more. These rangers are especially skilled
in the arts of combat, some training in the sword, others with the
polearm, and are particularly gifted in the arts of defence. Suspicious
of those found east of the Anduin, these men and women represent the
first line of defence of the kingdom of Gondor. This company is not for
the faint of heart, for they ever dwell beneath the shadow of Minas Morgul.

If your heart belongs in Ithilien, choose the <green> company.
