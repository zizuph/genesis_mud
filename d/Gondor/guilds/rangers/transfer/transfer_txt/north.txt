                  ~~ Rangers of the North ~~

Far to the north of Gondor, in the land of Eriador and lost kingdom of
Arnor, can be found the Grey Company, so named for the colour of their
travel-worn cloaks. Led by the last heir of Isildur, these grim rangers
are hidden sentinels, guarding without thanks (or the knowledge of) the
free peoples between Rivendell and the western sea. They pass among the
common folk in the disguise of strange and grim trackers, and as such
are secretive and have the ability to disguise their true nature. While
these rangers are able swordsmen or archers, their strengths lie more
in skills associated with scouting and stealth. It is also said that
the purity of the lineage of Isildur grants unto them especially potent
gifts of healing and herblore. The Rangers of the North are a reserved
and somber company, seldom revealing their true identities to outsiders.

If you search your heart and decide that you belong with the Rangers
of the North, choose the <grey> company.
