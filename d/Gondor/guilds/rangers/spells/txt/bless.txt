                   Ways of Blessing 
                 /-----------------/

    Living in Ithilien is a dangerous and difficult job, but
    necessary to save the beautiful land of Ithilien from falling
    further into the hands of evil. It is a battleground between
    the Rangers of Ithilien and the forces of the East. These
    hardened fighters depend upon their weapon for their very survival.
    It is no surprise, then, that these Rangers often pray to Aule,
    the Vala of Smiths. One determined Ranger delved further into the
    secrets of blessing, and found that the blessing is more effective
    when the wenya potion is rubbed on the weapon.
