                    Ways of Communing
                   /-----------------/

    Communication by normal means is a slow ordeal. The message must
    often travel many hundred leagues to reach the recipient, and the
    messenger may fall to many kinds of dangers on the way, or travel
    long and delaying detours to bring the message safely through. When
    the method of using carrier pigeons was discovered, messages could
    be dispatched much more quickly than before, for pigeons travel
    swiftly through the air, high above most dangers, and in straight
    lines to their known target. Rangers soon adopted this method of
    communing, to ensure a good intelligence network for their organization.

    More recently, Rangers began training ferrets to deliver messages
    where pigeons couldn't fly. They are limited by the fact that they
    cannot fly over vast expanses of water.
