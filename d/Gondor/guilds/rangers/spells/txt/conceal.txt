                       Ways of Concealing
                      /------------------/

    Living the life of a Ranger of the North is filled with danger. Their
    lives often hinge upon the ability to remain unseen, yet still be
    prepared to do battle. Small wonder, then, that these Rangers often
    pray to Aule, the Vala of Smiths, to enhance their body armours or
    cloaks to better conceal them. A common practice to go along with
    the prayer is to rub a leaf of curugwath on the armour.
