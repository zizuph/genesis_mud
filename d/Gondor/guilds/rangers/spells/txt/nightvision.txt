                   Ways of Seeing
                  /--------------/

    The Firstborn were blessed with the ability to see as clearly
    under a starlit night sky, as in full daylight. As Rangers of
    non-elven kin would have good use for this ability too, scholars
    made this prayer to Elbereth, the Mistress of the Stars, to
    provide this ability to others as well.
