Implementation of any ideas below would be positive...

Secrecy/Incognito: 

Unknown Rangers (Not Remembered or Introduced):
Ranger cloaks hide your identity but if worn, you are immediately identified
as a ranger.  We should maintain our ranger cloaks which hide description
so I do not see this changing.  The only ways to improve upon a cloaked
ranger is discussed below under Ranger Cloak. 

If you are not cloaked, an unknown individual can be identified as a ranger
by the guild object/soul which gives you the following in your description:
"You are looking grim and terrible, yet wise." for the highest rank/xp. It
is desirable to see this removed completely if possible or only visible to
rangers.  This would enable an unknown uncloaked ranger avoid be identified
as a ranger.


Known Rangers (Remembered or Introduced):
Titles: 
-option 1: rintro brief - we have this now - have a title which can show
 company affiliation but no specialty or rank (except officers)- Eg. Ranger
 of Ithilien
-option 2: rintro full - we have this now - have a title which can show
 specialties/rank
-option 3: rintro none - new - be able to have no title
-option 4: rintro west - new - have a title which can show no affiliation to
 a particular company, how about "Ranger of the Westlands"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ranger Cloak: 
-current benefits: hides your description 
-current dissatisfiers: AC of the ranger cloak is VERY low - strong
 dissatisfier as the cloak takes up the cloak spot but wearing it inhibits
 our combat ability - given that our defence and parry skills are low, we
 rely even more on having a decent AC to prevent getting beaten to a pulp

-suggested ways to address: 
 -ideal: change the cloak to not take up the cloak location so that high AC
  robes/cloaks can be worn - what do MM do?  SU have a veil which does
  something like this
 -less than ideal but better than nothing if this is the only change: raise
  the AC of the ranger cloak if it will continue to take up the cloak location

-"new" cloak feature suggestions: 
 -bottom line: when hooded, make it so you cannot be identified at all when
  looked at! - employ Palmer's help, he's smart ;) - this needs to account
  for quite a number of different objects and things such as: 
 -you are automaticly unknown to everyone (not introduced or remembered) - 
  so you are just a XXXX cloaked male human
 -all lay guild objects that result in something displayed when looked at 
 -all racial guild objects that result in something displayed when looked at 
 -all club objects that result in something displayed when looked at 
 -tattoos
 -changing or masking a person's physical features - this is a totally new
  idea game wide - ie I am very tall and lean for a human - remove it or
  change it to something else
 -obscure stat compares if possible - ie compare stats with xar if possible -
  my size gives me away but I think to some degree, wearing a cloak / being
  hooded can obscure that
 -obscure worn equipment when cloaked - armours, tie pouches, satchels, etc.

company guild halls: 
-different/new locations of the company guild halls is required 
-multiple entrances required with multiple paths to each entrance 
-remove tracking capability if possible in the near facinity of the guild
 halls so the halls cannot be found by following a ranger
-there is currently a poster listing the members of each company, and one for
 pupils as well - restrict reading access to only full ranger mortals and GM -
 everyone else will not be able to read it - including "pupils" 
-address wizard snooping: wizards are a primary source of guild information
 being leaked/stolen and distributed to the world
 -make all rooms in the guild halls inaccessable to wizards without a ranger
  guild soul - potential exceptions: members of AoP team or wizards of a
  certain rank or higher or wizards a part of the domain - start room
 -don't have a standard board per say that any wizard can read using the board
  tool or whatever - suggestions: require guild soul and be mortal, or be a
  member of the domain etc etc - boards are a primary source of wizard
  snoopin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
store bought equipment: 
-the whetstone sucks - rumour has it that the stone permanently damages
 weapons - it is therefore not used and is useless - I believe the SU have
 something to sharpen weapons - might want to look at that

spells, spellcasting, skills and lothmir: 
-have at least superior journeyman level in herbalism and spellcasting - this
 will convince a lot of rangers to leave their racial guilds that are in them
 to address the skill lackings of the rangers - ie the skill bonuses -
 Eg. dunedain would be a tax savings of 4%
-being able to choose between sword or polearm as being the highest skill
 is desired
-other dissatisfiers/penalties: 
 -can't cleanse in combat - this used to be there but was taken away 
 -casting during movement fails 
 -casting too easily interrupted by combat 
 -casting capability is easily prevented by "stuns" 
 -elbereth is useless - it barely affects an undead and they can immediately
  just walk back into the room 
 -nightvision is useless - allow the spell to work indoors and/or allow the 
  vision to adjust to amount of darkness present - up to 20 levels? :)
 -rest does not rest enough 
 -whistled/pigeons - pigeons can't fly inside rooms 
-spells are tax, therefore we don't need to pay for spells that are weak in
 effort or have limited value - so be careful about the new ones you add
-perhaps a spell with death magic resistance?

campfires:
 -allow a campfire to be "guard"ed by a ranger so that no one in the room
  can extinguish, kick it, or get torches from it - if no ranger is present
  in the room guarding it, then others should be able to do that - make 
  campfire torches keepable

lothmir:
-he needs not sell some important herbs to non-rangers - and he needs to be
 modified so that - he should be accessable to non-ranger non-evils but hard
 to find - possibly consider having captain control over which herbs are
 "not for sale" or have limited sale abilities

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brawl:
-if you start a brawl right now and the leave the room, the brawl is
 discontinued with no message - it is probably some error path in the 
 brawl code - if some message could be added it would help with clients
-rknee and trip do not work on really big opponents - this blows - for example,
 we are useless against the balrog - RoNs (with archery) may have some 
 capability there
-I believe there may be a racial disadvantage when it comes to brawling
 goblins, if so, it would be nice if this was removed

Council and Rules:
-if in agreement, I'd like the GM to promote a more secretive guild
 environment where the captains/council are directed to have rules around
 secrecy - ie not revealing members or skills or guild knowledge in general
 to the non-members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our enemies (mages):
-they have a spell which can result in rangers being stunned - I believe it
 results in being unable to cast or do any combat - could be from a spell
 object - in reality the obvious effects of the spell is fatigue and panic -
 would like to see this "stun" capability removed - maybe the spell is 
 choke-horror - or maybe it is ranger code doing it

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RoN:
-they need a damage special


That's all I can think of for now!
