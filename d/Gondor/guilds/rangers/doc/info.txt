The Rangers of the Westlands, detailed information document

============================================================================

Guild name : The Rangers of the Westland
Guild type : occupational
Guild style: ranger

GUILD IDEA
=======================
The Rangers of the Westlands started out as a kind of fighter guild,
based on the Rangers as presented by JRR Tolkien in his masterpiece,
the Lord of the Rings. The guild was opened in the spring of 1992,
but has since been changed in some ways.

The guild is of style 'ranger', which is a style defined as a mix
between fighter, thief and cleric, but is in no way possible to define
as a single of those.

The Rangers have only modest fighting skills, and are most proficient
in 'general' skills. The skills defined as thief skills and magic skills
are also taught to Rangers, but even these only to modest levels.

JOINING
=======================
A player who wants to join the Rangers must first find the guildhouse,
which is slightly hidden in a forest, requiring a little tracking and
location sense skill to find. This will make it a little hard for
complete newbies to join at least. Being able to reach the guildhouse
is enough to be allowed to join, unless you are of evil alignment, or
member of certain kinds of guilds or if you are a goblin.

To join, the player must be in the room /d/Gondor/common/guild/recruithall.c
and type 'sign name', signing up in the membership book present in that
room. The player will find himself a Ranger pupil, with a rather limited
membership. To be a full member, the pupil will have to convince a Captain
or a Lieutenant of one of the three Companies of Rangers to be accepted
into a Company. Becoming a full member means paying the full tax and
being in a Company of the Rangers, thus subject to the skill-limits that
Company offers. It is possible to leave a Company, but this is only for
the Captain of that company to decide, and it will also mean that the
skills the Ranger has trained above pupil level, will be lowered down
to the pupil-level again.
The Ranger will have the guild-shadow /d/Gondor/common/guild/ranger_shadow.c
The guild-soul is /d/Gondor/common/guild/ranger_soul.c
They will carry a guild-token to show their membership as well, and each
Company has their own token. The tokens are not sellable, and worth nothing.

Only dwarves, gnomes, kenders and hobbits are allowed to join.

THE RANGER COMPANIES
=======================

The Rangers were at first one guild, and still is so. But for a bit
more variety, they were split into three companies with different fields
of interest. These are:

The Rangers of the North.
	A company with their hide-out in the lost realm of Arnor. They are
	the remnants of the Dunedain of Arnor, protecting the lost realm
	and the hobbits who now reside there from the growing evil.
	They are based on Tolkien's Rangers of the North, and Strider/Aragorn
	and Halbarad Dunadan were both Rangers of the North.
	The North Company's field of interest is scouting, and they have
	higher thief-skill levels than the other companies to reflect this.
	Their startup-location is: /d/Gondor/common/guild/north/start_room.c

The Rangers of Ithilien.
	A company founded when the Gondorian peoples were evacuated from
	Ithilien as Orcs of Mordor begun to raid the land. They have a
	hide-out in the forests in Ithilien, and raid the enemy's armies
	from there. They are based on Tolkien's Rangers of Ithilien,
	and Faramir son of Denethor was a Ranger of Ithilien.
	The Ithilien Company's field of interest is in fighting, raiding
	the forces of Mordor. Thus they have higher skills in fighting
	than the other companies. Their startup-location is: 
	/d/Gondor/common/guild/ithilien/erockchamber.c	

The Rangers of Gondor.
	A company put together for gathering lore of ancient times, as
	clerical or scholarly Rangers. They still know some fighting
	and general skills, but clerical magic is their field of interest.
	They are not based directly on anything Tolkien wrote, but are
	still considered based on his Rangers. The Gondor Company have
	higher magic skills than the other companies.
	Their startup-location is: /d/Gondor/common/guild/startchamber.c

To become a member of a Company, the player must be accepted into the
Company by its Captain or Lieutenant, two positions being filled as
part of the Council of Rangers, as leaders of the guild and its
companies. This Council has all powers over the guild, and can also
throw Rangers out of the Companies again, and even out of the guild.

COUNCIL OF RANGERS
=======================

Each of the three Companies have a leader, the Captain, who is a mortal
player. The position has nothing to do with stats or guild-rank of
any kind, but is a position the Ranger is elected into. In the election,
only the council-members may suggest candidates, but all Rangers of
the Company may vote in the election.
The Captain elected can then choose a deputy, the Lieutenant, a decision
only the Captain can make - no election. The Lieutenant has deputized
powers, like being able to admit pupil Rangers into his Company, rewarding
or degrading them in rank, or punishing Ranger-abilities.
Only the Captain can remove punishments again, and only the Captains can
hand out the serious punishments, like expulsions and bannings.
The code of the council is in a few files, and is probably the most
complicated code of the Ranger guild :-) It can be found in these files:
/d/Gondor/common/guild/council.c   /d/Gondor/common/guild/lib/councilroom.c
and their commands are in the ranger_soul.c, in the include-file:
/d/Gondor/common/guild/lib/rwiz.h.
The Council-members have no real privileges by their position, they still
have the same abilities as other Rangers, with no bonuses. Their only
extra powers are those that are used for administrative purposes, and they
are all logged to prevent abusive players.


RANGERS AND MAGIC
=======================

As the profession Ranger has been defined, a Ranger has abilities within
fighting, scout/thieving and clerical magic.
The Rangers have purposely been split into three divisions, each focusing
on one of these three ability-classes, thus somewhat neglecting the two
others instead. Still, the magic offered to the Rangers, particularly
to the Rangers of Gondor, the 'clerical' affiliated Company, is not plentiful.
They have up until August 1994 had 4 spells for their use, but a major
change is forthcoming as this document is written.
The main change is that the Rangers will have more spells available, though
only being able to get some of them, so they will have to choose with care.
They will pay a certain tax for this, and I have chosen to tax the spells
using common sense with the 'man magic' docs (even though they are not
official), using the Magical Layman table.
The spells will be documented when finished, in the directory
/d/Gondor/open/SPELLS/rangers/ 

The magic offered to Rangers is in no way offensive. They are either
healing, protecting, or for utiliary use.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
=======================

The Rangers have some abilities exclusive to them. They are abilities
that hopefully will give the Ranger a better chance of surviving and
avoiding danger. These abilities are:

Listen <direction>: Give the Ranger a possible indication if livings are
	present in that direction. With higher skill more info about the
	livings can be gained, like corporal size, and race. 
	The listen skill is no. 81209.

Brawl <opponent>  : The Ranger's form for combat aid. These are 'dirty' tricks
	in combat, and gives a random effect of either throwing sand in the
	opponents eyes, or knocking his weapon out of his hand.
	Blinding is reached by setting the LIVE_I_SEE_INVIS prop in the
	player to -1, which means blindness in mudlib terms.
	Disarming will force the disarmed living to unwield its weapon,
	and in rarer cases to drop it. 
	The brawling skill is no. 81200.
	Brawling can be stopped from working in special monsters that for
	example have no eyes to blind, by setting a property in them:
		"_ranger_i_not_brawl"

These abilities both depend on skills that must be trained, and are
thus limited by guild-rank and Company. It is also possible for a Ranger
to be punished, so that his brawl and listen skill works only half as
good.

LEAVING
=======================
A player who wants to leave the Rangers must go to the same room as
where he joined, /d/Gondor/common/guild/recruithall.c and 'erase name'
from the membership book there. The player will get his skills reduced
as a punishment, so that (s)he won't find it much profitable to leave
for another guild in the way of skills or abilities. If the ex-ranger
also had a spellbook of the Rangers, it will be removed. Also, the
SS_OCCUP stat will be set to zero, as all guilds should do when a
member leaves, as that stat is a measure of how experienced the member
is in 'being a member'.
It is also possible to be thrown out of the Rangers, expelled or banned
by a Captain of the guild. This is a punishment the Captains have the
power to put on Rangers who do not act according to the rules of the guild.
Being expelled or banned follows the normal leaving-function of the guild
though, so there is no difference except this being a non-voluntary solution.
