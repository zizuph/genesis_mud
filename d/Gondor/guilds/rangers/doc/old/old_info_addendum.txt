Addendum to Rangers Tax Documentation (/d/Gondor/info/GUILD/rangers)

   Tigerlily, January, 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Carrying forward the Ranger tradition that was created by
Elessar, Olorin, Mercade, and other great Gondorian wizards, the 
basic theme and characterization of the ranger guild will remain 
the same as always.  However, between the years 2001-2004, 
the guild was recoded by the team of Alto and Gwyneth, with 
some later minor adjustments by Tigerlily, in order to update 
the rangers to modern standards.

There are two major changes that affect Rangers with the recoded 
version: general administration of the guild, based upon a principle
of choice determined by vote of the membership, and an updated skill 
set including a selection or specialization in weapon options. 

The following directory contains the ranger guild recode: 
    
    /d/Gondor/guilds/rangers/..

See documentation in the above directory for more information 
on file specifications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
II.  Administration of the Ranger guild. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    With the recoded version of the guild, there are two companies,
    the Rangers of Ithilien and the Rangers of the North. The 
    Rangers of Gondor will no longer be extant, and the guildhouse
    in Gondor will become home to apprentice rangers (formerly 
    pupils).

    Formerly known as the Rangers of Gondor, the guild will now
    be known as the Rangers of the Westlands. 

    Players will be able to join the Rangers by answering a 
    set of questions administered by Amaron upon finding the
    headquarters in Gondor (/d/Gondor/guilds/rangers/hq/join.c) 

    New rangers become apprentices and will have a limited period 
    of time (4 months) to prove their worth before becoming a full 
    ranger. After completion of tasks administered by a wise
    woman, apprentices become eligible to apply to either the 
    Ithilien Company (RoI) or the Grey Company (RoN).

    Apprentices are subject both to limited skills and to
    limited spell usage, and thus their tax rates are discounted by 
    comparison with a full ranger (see below).

    The outcome of a vote among the ranger membership determines
    whether an apprentice will be accepted to join one of the
    companies as a full ranger.  In the event that the membership
    fails in its duties to complete the vote over a period of time, 
    the apprentice will become a full ranger by default.

    The voting process will also be used to select and support the 
    leadership roles of the guild. Votes will be prompted at six month 
    intervals, to ensure that the leadership has the full support
    of the guild membership.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
III.  Skills Update
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ranger skills have been upgraded to allow for a weapon choice
    for both the RoN and the RoI as reflects their somewhat different
    guild styles. The Rangers of the North following Aragorn live a
    secluded life in the lost realm of Arnor. In secret they defend the
    borders of the Shire and require stealth, herbalism and magical 
    abilities in addition to basic fighting skills. They will have
    a choice between the sword and the bow for as a preference
    based upon their fighting style. 

    The Rangers of Ithilien under Captain Faramir live beneath the
    Shadow of Mordor and have honed more advanced fighting skills 
    to battle orcs and trolls in defence of Gondor. At the
    same time they are are less skilled in magic and stealth. Their
    weapon choices will be either the sword or polearm.

    In addition to allowing a choice, ranger weapon skills have
    been upgraded to Superior Master (for RoI) and Superior
    Veteran (for RoN), following the varying company profiles.

    Apprentices have lower skills and are not allowed a choice
    in weapon beyond sword to level 50 and other weapons
    to adventurer guild levels only.  In addition, they are 
    capable with only two spells (Communing and Heal) and
    limited ability with brawl and listen.

    Below is a summary of supported skill levels for Apprentices,
    Rangers of Ithilien, and Rangers of the North including the
    tax computation per company for primary mud skills.

IV. Tax Updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous tax was computed as follows (last modification: Olorin, 
August 1997):

TAX LEVELS (August 1997, see /d/Gondor/info/GUILD/rangers document)

                 Ranger pupils:  Gondor:      Ithilien:       North:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Under the assumption (as of April, 2004, subject to future
revision as needed) that the basic spells, brawl and listen have not 
changed significantly since the last evaluation, and that the other 
items relating to tax computation have not changed substantially, 
the revised tax for the updated Ranger skills and items is as follows:

TAX LEVELS (April 2004)&
Summary
               Apprentices:        Ithilien:         North:
Skill-levels     4.00%              11.000%          10.667%

Potions          0.75%               0.750%           0.75%
                 8.41%              19.680%          19.347%

        Actual:  8   %              20   %           20   %

&The file /d/Gondor/guilds/rangers/rangers.h includes the 
definitions for tax and skill profiles per company.

Currently the occupational tax is set to 20%. Additional spells
and potions may be added later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
V. Next Phase
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Additions and updates can be expected later in 2004 due to AoB 
review of brawl as well as additions of new spells and potions.  

--To be determined.
