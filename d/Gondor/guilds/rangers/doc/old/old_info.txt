============================================================================
The Rangers of the Westlands, detailed information document
	by Elessar, August 1994.

============================================================================

The Rangers of the Westlands started out as a kind of fighter guild,
based on the Rangers as presented by JRR Tolkien in his masterpiece,
the Lord of the Rings. The guild was opened in the spring of 1992,
but has since been changed in some ways.
The guild is of style 'ranger', which is a style defined as a mix
between fighter, thief and cleric, but in no way possible to define
as a single of those.
The Rangers have only modest fighting skills, and are most proficient
in 'general' skills. The skills defined as thief skills and magic skills
are also taught to Rangers, but even these only to modest levels.

JOINING THE RANGERS
-------------------

A player who wants to join the Rangers must first find the guildhouse,
which is slightly hidden in a forest, requiring a little tracking and
location sense skill to find. This will make it a little hard for
complete newbies to join at least. Being able to reach the guildhouse
is enough to be allowed to join, unless you are of evil alignment, or
member of certain kinds of guilds or if you are a goblin.
To join, the player must be in the room /d/Gondor/common/guild/recruithall.c
and type 'sign name', signing up in the membership book present in that
room. The player will find himself a Ranger pupil, with a rather limited
membership. To be a full member, the pupil will have to convince a Captain
or a Lieutenant of one of the three Companies of Rangers to be accepted
into a Company. Becoming a full member means paying the full tax and
being in a Company of the Rangers, thus subject to the skill-limits that
Company offers. It is possible to leave a Company, but this is only for
the Captain of that company to decide, and it will also mean that the
skills the Ranger has trained above pupil level, will be lowered down
to the pupil-level again.
The Ranger will have the guild-shadow /d/Gondor/common/guild/ranger_shadow.c
The guild-soul is /d/Gondor/common/guild/ranger_soul.c
They will carry a guild-token to show their membership as well, and each
Company has their own token. The tokens are not sellable, and worth nothing.
The Rangers of Gondor and the Pupil Rangers: 
	/d/Gondor/common/guild/rring.c
The Rangers of Ithilien:
	/d/Gondor/common/guild/ramulet.c
The Rangers of the North:
	/d/Gondor/common/guild/rbrooch.c


LEAVING THE RANGERS
-------------------

A player who wants to leave the Rangers must go to the same room as
where he joined, /d/Gondor/common/guild/recruithall.c and 'erase name'
from the membership book there. The player will get his skills reduced
as a punishment, so that (s)he won't find it much profitable to leave
for another guild in the way of skills or abilities. If the ex-ranger
also had a spellbook of the Rangers, it will be removed. Also, the
SS_OCCUP stat will be set to zero, as all guilds should do when a
member leaves, as that stat is a measure of how experienced the member
is in 'being a member'.
It is also possible to be thrown out of the Rangers, expelled or banned
by a Captain of the guild. This is a punishment the Captains have the
power to put on Rangers who do not act according to the rules of the guild.
Being expelled or banned follows the normal leaving-function of the guild
though, so there is no difference except this being a non-voluntary solution.


THE RANGER COMPANIES
--------------------

The Rangers were at first one guild, and still is so. But for a bit
more variety, they were split into three companies with different fields
of interest. These are:

The Rangers of the North.
	A company with their hide-out in the lost realm of Arnor. They are
	the remnants of the Dunedain of Arnor, protecting the lost realm
	and the hobbits who now reside there from the growing evil.
	They are based on Tolkien's Rangers of the North, and Strider/Aragorn
	and Halbarad Dunadan were both Rangers of the North.
	The North Company's field of interest is scouting, and they have
	higher thief-skill levels than the other companies to reflect this.
	Their startup-location is: /d/Gondor/common/guild/north/start_room.c

The Rangers of Ithilien.
	A company founded when the Gondorian peoples were evacuated from
	Ithilien as Orcs of Mordor begun to raid the land. They have a
	hide-out in the forests in Ithilien, and raid the enemy's armies
	from there. They are based on Tolkien's Rangers of Ithilien,
	and Faramir son of Denethor was a Ranger of Ithilien.
	The Ithilien Company's field of interest is in fighting, raiding
	the forces of Mordor. Thus they have higher skills in fighting
	than the other companies. Their startup-location is: 
	/d/Gondor/common/guild/ithilien/erockchamber.c	

The Rangers of Gondor.
	A company put together for gathering lore of ancient times, as
	clerical or scholarly Rangers. They still know some fighting
	and general skills, but clerical magic is their field of interest.
	They are not based directly on anything Tolkien wrote, but are
	still considered based on his Rangers. The Gondor Company have
	higher magic skills than the other companies.
	Their startup-location is: /d/Gondor/common/guild/startchamber.c

To become a member of a Company, the player must be accepted into the
Company by its Captain or Lieutenant, two positions being filled as
part of the Council of Rangers, as leaders of the guild and its
companies. This Council has all powers over the guild, and can also
throw Rangers out of the Companies again, and even out of the guild.


SKILLS OF THE RANGERS
---------------------

The Rangers are split into three companies, as well as a pupil level,
that all offer different levels of skills. 

Skill-name		Pupils		Gondor		Ithilien	North
SS_WEP_SWORD		 50		 70		 80		 75
SS_WEP_POLEARM		  0		  0		 65		  0
SS_DEFENCE		 35		 45		 60		 45
SS_PARRY		 10		 10		 40		 20

SS_SNEAK		 40		 60		 60		 80
SS_HIDE			 40		 60		 60		 85
SS_AWARENESS		 60		 80		 75		 75
SS_FR_TRAP		  0		  0		  0		  0

SS_HERBALISM		 35		 75		 45		 40
SS_ALCHEMY		  0		  0		  0		  0
SS_SPELLCRAFT		 30		 60		 40		 40
SS_ELEMENT_LIFE		 30		 50		 40		 40
SS_FORM_CONJURATION	 10		 50		 20		 20
SS_FORM_ABJURATION	  0		 30		  0		  0

SS_TRACKING		 40		 60		 50		 80
SS_LOC_SENSE		  0		  0		  0		 50
SS_HUNTING		 40		 50		 50		 50
SS_ANI_HANDL		  0		  0		  0		  0

Ranger special skills
SS_HEARING		 50		100		100		100
SS_BRAWLING		 50	 	100		100		100

Skills cannot be trained to these max levels from the start, but are limited
by the SS_OCCUP stat which again may be modified by penalties/rewards each
Ranger may have been given by the Captains.


SPECIAL ABILITIES
-----------------

The Rangers have some abilities exclusive to them. They are abilities
that hopefully will give the Ranger a better chance of surviving and
avoiding danger. These abilities are:

Listen <direction>: Give the Ranger a possible indication if livings are
	present in that direction. With higher skill more info about the
	livings can be gained, like corporal size, and race. 
	The listen skill is no. 81209.

Brawl <opponent>  : The Ranger's form for combat aid. These are 'dirty' tricks
	in combat, and gives a random effect of either throwing sand in the
	opponents eyes, or knocking his weapon out of his hand.
	Blinding is reached by setting the LIVE_I_SEE_INVIS prop in the
	player to -1, which means blindness in mudlib terms.
	Disarming will force the disarmed living to unwield its weapon,
	and in rarer cases to drop it. 
	The brawling skill is no. 81200.
	Brawling can be stopped from working in special monsters that for
	example have no eyes to blind, by setting a property in them:
		"_ranger_i_not_brawl"

These abilities both depend on skills that must be trained, and are
thus limited by guild-rank and Company. It is also possible for a Ranger
to be punished, so that his brawl and listen skill works only half as
good.


COUNCIL OF RANGERS
------------------

Each of the three Companies have a leader, the Captain, who is a mortal
player. The position has nothing to do with stats or guild-rank of
any kind, but is a position the Ranger is elected into. In the election,
only the council-members may suggest candidates, but all Rangers of
the Company may vote in the election.
The Captain elected can then choose a deputy, the Lieutenant, a decision
only the Captain can make - no election. The Lieutenant has deputized
powers, like being able to admit pupil Rangers into his Company, rewarding
or degrading them in rank, or punishing Ranger-abilities.
Only the Captain can remove punishments again, and only the Captains can
hand out the serious punishments, like expulsions and bannings.
The code of the council is in a few files, and is probably the most
complicated code of the Ranger guild :-) It can be found in these files:
/d/Gondor/common/guild/council.c   /d/Gondor/common/guild/lib/councilroom.c
and their commands are in the ranger_soul.c, in the include-file:
/d/Gondor/common/guild/lib/rwiz.h.
The Council-members have no real privileges by their position, they still
have the same abilities as other Rangers, with no bonuses. Their only
extra powers are those that are used for administrative purposes, and they
are all logged to prevent abusive players.


RANGERS AND MAGIC
-----------------

As the profession Ranger has been defined, a Ranger has abilities within
fighting, scout/thieving and clerical magic.
The Rangers have purposely been split into three divisions, each focusing
on one of these three ability-classes, thus somewhat neglecting the two
others instead. Still, the magic offered to the Rangers, particularly
to the Rangers of Gondor, the 'clerical' affiliated Company, is not plentiful.
They have up until August 1994 had 4 spells for their use, but a major
change is forthcoming as this document is written.
The main change is that the Rangers will have more spells available, though
only being able to get some of them, so they will have to choose with care.
They will pay a certain tax for this, and I have chosen to tax the spells
using common sense with the 'man magic' docs (even though they are not
official), using the Magical Layman table.
The spells will be documented when finished, in the directory
/d/Gondor/open/SPELLS/rangers/ 

The magic offered to Rangers is in no way offensive. They are either
healing, protecting, or for utiliary use.

Tax:			     3.16%	     8.71%	     8.91%	     8.21%
			

Spell taxes:
See the documents on spells and potions in /d/Gondor/open/SPELLS/rangers/.

Spells:
		Class		Tax		Level
whistle		  1		0.1 %		  5
nightvision	  1		0.1 %		  5
rest		  2		0.25%		 10
elbereth	  2		0.25%		 10
heal		  3		0.5 %		 15
cleanse		  3		0.5 %		 20
				1.7 %

A ranger can only learn a limited number of spells, according to his
or her company and the levels of the spells. Pupils can learn up to 20
levels, Rangers of Gondor up to 100 levels, and Rangers of the North
and Rangers of Ithilien up to 60 levels.

Thus the tax for pupils is 0.5 %, for Rangers of Gondor 1.7 %, and for
Rangers of the North and of Ithilien, it is 1.6 %.


Potions:
Ranger potions have direct effects, and can be mixed successfully only
by rangers. Therefore, they are taxed like spells.

		Class	Tax
avarywalme	  2	0.25%
este		  2	0.25%
wenya		  2	0.25%
			0.75%

The potions avarywalme and este have the same or comparable effects as
the ranger spells heal, rest, and cleanse. Therefore, they should not
be taxed as separately, but the identical effects should be taken into
account by reducing the total tax for spells and those potions.
However, this reduction has not been applied.  


Other taxable abilities:
Brawling:
MAX_TIME_TO_RECOVER       35
MIN_TIME_TO_RECOVER       15
MAX_TIME_BRAWL            22
MIN_TIME_BRAWL             7
TIME_BEFORE_ACTUAL_BRAWL   6

It takes max 41 seconds between each brawl, and minimum 21 seconds,
based on the brawl-skill. The effect of a brawl lasts between 7
seconds and 22 seconds, also depending on the brawl-skill. A drawback
implemented in brawling is that the victim of a brawl will a little by
little 'learn' how to avoid being brawled, and so the effectiveness
decreases after some fighting. 
The chance of a successful brawl is ~50%, but then decreasing as the
victim 'learns' to avoid it. Disarming will happen about 30% of the
time, and the chance for a total disarm (i.e. dropping of weapon) is
~25%. 
A calculation based on how these effects work on combat, using a lot
of common sense and help from statistical experts (Milan of Rhovanion)
was made, judging brawling to give a combat aid of about 80%. Being
blinded means a decreased combat ability for the victim, as does being
disarmed. But the 'learning' part weighs this out a little, and an
agreement with the AoB Olorin decreased the combat aid with 10% for
this drawback. 
Brawling is also dependant on a guild-specific skill, no 118200, which
then halves the combat aid to 35%.
According to the rules, this will mean a tax of 35% / 6 = 5.83%

Listen:
The 'listen'-ability is based on a guild-specific skill, no 118209.
It allows the Ranger a chance to hear if there are any livings in the
next room. As a special ability with relatively minor effect, this was 
taxed to 0.5% for full rangers who can train the ability to sup guru,
and 0.25% for pupils.

Shops, pubs etc:
There are no pubs or shops that give the Rangers a better deal than
other players. The only 'prejudice' is towards evil players, who are
just refused to trade there, but this does not affect the taxing.
The Rangers do not have a weapon-rack, nor any tell-abilities.


TAX LEVELS
A summary of the taxing:
	         Ranger pupils:	 Gondor:	Ithilien:	North:
Skill-levels     3.17%		  8.72%		 8.92%		 8.22%
Brawl            2.91%		  5.83%		 5.83%		 5.83%  
Listen           0.25%		  0.5 %		 0.5 %		 0.5 %
Spells		 0.5 %		  1.7 %		 1.6 %		 1.6 %
Potions          0.75%            0.75%          0.75%           0.75%                    
		 7.58%		 17.5 %		17.6 %		16.9 %

	Actual:  8   %		 18   %		18   %		18   %


These taxes will be revised again as the new Ranger spells arrive.
Most likely, the tax will be raised by 3-5 %


//Elessar Telcontar, Guildmaster of the Rangers of the Westlands
	July 1994.

//Last modification: Olorin, August 1997.
			Modified skill tax calculation.
			Modified spell and potion tax calculation.

// Modified by Tigerlily, March 23, 2004--increased Ithilien skill
   in SS_ABJURATION_FORM from 0 to 15 levels (15 * .1 /6 = .25 increase)--
   when added to 17.6% tax this equals 17.85, when rounded there is no
   net increase in tax. This was done to correct a bug in ithilien
   training.
