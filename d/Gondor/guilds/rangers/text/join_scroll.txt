                             Welcome, Ranger!
                             ================
      You have now been accepted as a Ranger Apprentice. This will provide
      you with a set of new commands, listed when you type 'help rangers'.
      You will have a ring you can wear, which is the membership-token of
      the Ranger Apprentices and the Master Rangers who teach them.

      The Rangers of the Westlands often work in secret, serving as scouts
      and spies for the defense against the growing menace from the East.
      Hence each ranger should be careful about what to tell outsiders about
      the guild.

      You have entered a time of testing and proving. For the next four
      months you will be watched by members of two companies, the Rangers
      of Ithilien and the Rangers of the North. Understand that these
      rangers will probably not completely trust you at first, so you must
      earn it. When you have done so, you will be given the title of
      'Trusted Apprentice'. You have four months from this day to gain
      that status -- otherwise you will be removed from the guild.

      Your first task is to go upstairs, find a bunk, and <start here>.
      After that, visit the library to learn much more about the guild
      from books that were not available to you before joining. Be sure to
      post a note on the board upstairs introducing yourself to your new
      guildmates. When you are ready, you should begin the tasks assigned
      by Lossefalme.

      A Ranger has become a valuable asset to every party of adventurers, so
      if you feel inadequate on your own, seek company with others - most
      will be glad to join a Ranger.

                  Good luck with your Ranger-future!
