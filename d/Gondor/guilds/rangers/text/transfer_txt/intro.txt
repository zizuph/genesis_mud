In order to make an informed choice, you must read and
think on the differences between the companies.  Once the 
selection is made, turning back will not be easy.  See
the additional chapters on the skills and duties of the
two companies, the North and Ithilien. 

For Apprentices (formerly Pupils), there is only one choice: 
To leave or to stay. If you should decide to leave, there 
will be no penalty in loss of experience, however, you will 
lose the skills that you have learned from the Rangers.

For full rangers, the choices are more arduous. You may 
choose either to join the Rangers of the North or the
Rangers of Ithilien. You may also choose to leave the
guild, but you will lose the skills that you have gained
from the Rangers.

There is no easy path, and each way is beset by danger
from the Enemy on all sides. Choose wisely.
