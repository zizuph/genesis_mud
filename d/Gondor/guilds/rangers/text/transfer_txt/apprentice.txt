               ~~ Apprentices ~~

Former Pupils will now have the title of "Apprentice."
There is a time limit to how long you can remain 
an apprentice (three months). If an apprentice does not
become a full ranger by the end of the time
period, he/she will be removed from the guild
and will need to reapply.

Upon entering the door that will transform a Pupil to 
Apprentice, the clock will start ticking.

After the required time period during which 
an apprentice must prove him/herself, the
apprentice will become an "Approved Apprentice."
At that time a vote will be initiated among the 
rangers as to whether the apprentice is deemed 
worthy to be accepted into the guild and to which 
company they will be assigned.

Ranger apprentices may train up to the following
skill levels:
