              ~~ Rangers of the North ~~

Far to the north of Gondor, in the land of Eriador and 
old kingdom of Arnor, can be found the Grey Company, so
named for the colour of their travel-worn cloaks. Led by 
the last heir of Isildur, these grim rangers are hidden 
sentinels, guarding without thanks (or the knowledge of) 
the free peoples between Rivendell and the western sea. 
They pass among the common folk in the disguise of strange 
and grim trackers, and as such are secretive and have the 
ability to disguise their true nature. While these rangers 
are able swordsmen or archers, their strengths lie more in 
skills associated with scouting and stealth. It is also said 
that the purity of the lineage of Isildur grants unto them 
especially potent gifts of healing and herblore. The Rangers 
of the North are a reserved and somber company, seldom 
revealing their true identities to outsiders.

Among the skills that the Rangers of the North 
possess are the following:
