              ~~ Rangers of Ithilien ~~
                   
Across the great river Anduin from Minas Tirith is found
the beautiful yet dangerous forest of Ithilien. Occupied by the 
armies of Mordor since the fall of Osgiliath, this land is 
not a place for the timid. Fighting from hidden places in the 
forest are the Rangers of Ithilien, descendants of the free
peoples who once dwelt there in peace. Led by the second son
of the Steward, these brave rangers are freedom-fighters
ambushing orc and haradrim patrols to devastating effect and
then fading into the trees once more. These rangers are 
especially skilled in the arts of combat, some training in
the sword, others with the polearm, and are particularly 
gifted in the arts of defence. Suspicious of those found east 
of the Anduin, these men and women represent the first line 
of defence of the kingdom of Gondor. This company is not for
the faint of heart, for they ever dwell beneath the shadow of 
Minas Morgul.
