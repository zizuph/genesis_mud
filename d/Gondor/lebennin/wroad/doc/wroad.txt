Project: Linhir, road to Pelargir and Corsair camp

The city of Linhir sits on the confluence of the rivers Gilrain and Serni.
The plan is to make a decent hunting ground for mid-level players of both
alignments. The guards in Linhir feeding the evil population and the corsair
camp feeding the good population. There will also be a quest for both categories
of players, tightly integraated with the corsair presence near Linhir.

Status:

Currently the skeleton rooms of the road and corsair camp is done.
Descriptions, room tells and npcs still need to be added.
Linhir needs to be coded.


QUEST:
  Corsairs roam the roads between Linhir and Pelargir during the night, robbing
  the good folks of Lebennin. The Warden of Linhir (Thurber) wants 
  reinforcements from Pelargir to patrol the road. The quest starts at Dolmien 
  in a hunting cabin south of the road between Linhir and Pelargir (wr14.c). 
  Dolmien asks you to talk to the Warden of Linhir. Depending on the players 
  alignment, the Warden will either direct the player to Carastur, or dismiss 
  him/her. 

  - Good version: After Dolmein, talk to Warden. He will ask you to go to 
  Carastur and request troops for defence against increased Corsair activity, 
  smuggling ships have been spotted in the harbour at night. The smiths 
  apprentice (Felrek) was killed on the road from Pelargir to Linhir, 
  transporting a wagonload of materials.

  evil version ---
  go ask warden of linhir task - he will say the player are untrustworthy and 
  dismiss him/her. When the player next passes the boulder at room wr7.c 
  a group of corsairs will approach the player and iniate the evil version of 
  the quest, directing the player to the corsair camp south of Linhir.


TODO:
Quest with Dolmien in cabin.
Barracks and Guard tower in Linhir needs to have decent amount of soldiers.
Corsair camp
Guard captain has a nice shield for newbies (magic until a certain avg)
Corsair camp has a nice weapon for newbies (magic until a certain avg) - 
random all types - wields the same type as you use when attacking him

Both corsairs and guards only assist when either a team attacks, or the player
is above a certain avg.
