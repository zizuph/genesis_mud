                 * The Gladiators of Athas *
                 ***************************
 
  The Gladiators of Athas are the great duelists of a doomed
land.  They live and die in the arenas that dot Cirath, ears
ringing with screams: That of the bloodthirsty crowds, fallen
opponents, and their own. Some say that most gladiators even
hear their own death scream, echoed in their worst nightmares:
It is this which gives them their fearless drive, which a
lesser man would call madness. Of course they are entertainers
as much as warriors, so the ferocity could be as much acting 
as reality, but the crowds don't care: So jaded are the people
of this land that only by watching another kill and die for
them can they imagine triumphing over their own problems.
