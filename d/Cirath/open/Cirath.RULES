           The following is a short summary of rules and
     regulations designed to reduce misunderstandings. This is
     in no way meant to threaten or scare you. It is merely to
    let you know what is expected of you as a wizard of Cirath.
 
 
                         RESPONSIBILITIES
     1) You should be familiar with and hold to the contents 
        of /d/Genesis/doc/rules/wizard/wiz_vs_player_policy.
 
     2) Cheating: This subject will not be elaborated on here.
        It will not be tolerated in the least.  Fail to grasp
        this and you will find yourself domainless or worse.
 
     3) You are expected to become thoroughly versed in
        man INTRO, man INTRO_RULES, and man LPC.
        Note: This does not mean you have to know how to code.
 
     4) Stay Sane: If coding is interfering with your real
        life, step back and slow down (tell me though of course).
        If you burn-out/loose your job/get expelled you don't
        benefit the domain or yourself.
 
          
                        MORTAL RELATIONS
     1) All your secondary characters must be registered:
        Seconds will follow the rules set by the administration.
 
     2) Wizards will code more than play mortal seconds: Playing
        to relax and keep touch with the player's viewpoint now
        and then is acceptable, but you are a wizard first.
 
     3) Wizard/mortal interaction is tolerated, though personally
        I would rather you interact for role-playing reasons. 
        Mortals in wizard workrooms is frowned upon.
 
 
                              CODE
     1) All open code will stay out of personal directories.
       
     2) Coders will stick to the Cirathian themes: Ancient style
        civilization, mongol style raiders, mercenary barbarians,
        and generally poor land (desert, steppe, etc).
 
     3) Domain projects come first, personal projects second.
 
     4) The Lord or the Lady is responsible for EVERY object in
        the domain. Therefore, he or she alone has the right to
        decide which new code is made available to the mortals.
        This means especially that a quest or an area may only be
        opened by the Lord or the Lady of a domain, or by a wizard
        who has the explicite permission to do so.
 
 
                            IF IN DOUBT
           Ask me or anyone else that is Lord and above.
 
 
      These are very basic rules, if you have any questions,
      do not hesitate to ask me, Serpine, for clarification.
 
      Written by: Serpine, mostly based on the work of Vladimir
               who had hefty help from Olorin (#4 under Code is 
               straight from the Gondor new_wiz rules).
