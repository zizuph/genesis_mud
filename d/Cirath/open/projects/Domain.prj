  The domain of Cirath is Barbaric in nature: The war between good and
evil doesn't rage here, it was fought and lost by both sides ages ago,
leaving much of the land barren.  To the north are the raiders of
Katakoro (based on the Horde novels & games and Mongols of history ).
South are the few remaining city states of Athas (based on the Dark Sun
novels & games and ancient Rome & Egypt).  And east is Chukel, a
barbaric and mercenary civilization only barely rebuilding.
