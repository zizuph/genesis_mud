Cirath is based loosely upon a combination of many intersting ideas.
Foremost among them is the Dark Sun theme from TSR.  This is a land
of little water, little metals, and a place where even the hardiest
adventurer can be easily destroyed by the wild beasts that ravage the
wasteland of Athas.  This is combined with a plains area resembling
the plains of Mongolia containing wild barbarians.  There are other 
areas as well that fit in this vein of wildness and chaos, and in
time they will all be completed.
