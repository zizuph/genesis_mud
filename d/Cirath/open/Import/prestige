         Summary of the Solamnian Knight Prestige File
  (Note: Monster means it thinks, creature means it doesn't).

      Type                Suggested Prestige
  Evil Monsters   : (Average_stat*Average_stat)/10
  Evil Creatures  : (Average_stat*Average_stat)/40
  Animals(neutral): 0
  Good Creatures  : -1
  Good People     : -1 through -4
  Holy People     : As low as -8
  Quest related   : -1 or below (if you don't want knights to kill em).

           You need this procedure in your NPCs (# = prestige):
int query_knight_prestige() { return # }

           You can also (for quests for instance) set it directly:
if(player->query_guild_member("Solamnian Knights"))
   player->change_prestige(#);
