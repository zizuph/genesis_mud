Currently (3-1-95) there is nothing in Cirath that uses other
Domain's objects/files....that I know of anyway!

Napture.

We are ready to use:

  Shire/Gondor herbs
  Shire rock (for protection spell)
  Roke skin
  Krynn prestige

These are the only bits of info I could easily gleam from
all domain's open/ directories...if you have something else (quest / spell
object for example) let us know!
