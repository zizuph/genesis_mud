- guild abilities:
  o signal
    Ability to make smoke signals. Player can send
    one of 5 signals or any single character. Sending
    takes 10+random(5) seconds (like search or count)
    and costs 5 fatigue points. Highly unreliable
    error increases with distance.                      0.50/0.50

  o plant rumour
    Ability to plant rumours in NPCs and PCs. Rumours
    will spread and may be overheard by anyone. 
    Basically it is a nice free emote with time delay
    but it also can be considered as highly unreliable
    mean for sending and leaving messages               0.50/0.50

  o shield  (no command - works when shield is worn)
    Helps player to cover hits, 25%/15% combat aid
    since it uses a skill 50% tax reduction             2.09/1.25

  o smash
    A special attack making damage 24%/14% combat aid
    since it uses a skill 50% tax reduction             2.00/1.17

  o scare
    A special attack used for initiating a combat.
    It is only supplement for smash therefore no combat
    aid (it is already in smash).                       0.50/0.50

  o focus
    A special ability to focus on the shield skill
    20%/9% combat aid. Uses shield skill hence 50% 
    tax reduction                                       1.67/0.75

  o defend
    A special ability to defend teammember (must be AA
    too) Works like focus only defence is distributed 
    between player (extra) and defended (usual).
    20%/9% combat aid.  Skill as above                  1.67/0.75
------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sum                                                   5.59/3.92
  (only one from smash, defend and focus at a time)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Total                                                  12.85/8.18
Actually taxed                                         14%  /9%

Computation of combat aid
*************************

code is in:
  /d/Rhovanion/common/shield_guild/s_c_shield.c
  /d/Rhovanion/common/shield_guild/s_c_soul.c

***********************************************
constant shield defence:
assume ac = 40
OCC:
aid = 25%
chance to cover hit = 20%
  random(2*(20+100)) <= random((20+100)*.79)
(20% covered -> 4/5 damage taken -> 5/4 duration in fight -> 25% aid)
LAY:
aid = 15%
chance to cover hit = 13%
  random(2*(20+100)) <= random((20+100)*0.5)
***********************************************

FOCUS (same for DEFEND)
OCC:
chance to cover hit = 33%
  random(2*(20+100)) <= random((20+100)*1.30)
aid while focus = 50%
focus adds to aid = 25%
duration = 50 seconds
frequency = 50+12 seconds
aid = 25 * 50 / (50+12) = 20%
LAY:
chance to cover hit = 21%
  random(2*(20+100)) <= random((20+100)*0.82)
add while focus = 26%
focus adds to aid = 11%
duration = 50 seconds
frequency = 50+12 seconds
aid = 11 * 50 / (50+12) = 9%

***********************************************

SMASH
OCC:
avg. frequency = 12+12 seconds = 4.8 rounds
chance to hit = 74%
  random(400) > random(200)
avg_pen = F_PENMOD(40+16+10,100) = 434
std_pen = F_PENMOD(40,100)       = 280
aid = chance*avg_pen/(frequency*std_pen) = 24% 
LAY:
avg. frequency = (12+12)*1.34 seconds = 6.4 rounds
chance to hit = 74%
  random(400) > random(200)
avg_pen = F_PENMOD(40+16+10,100)*0.8 = 347
std_pen = F_PENMOD(40,100)       = 280
aid = chance*avg_pen/(frequency*std_pen) = 14% 

***********************************************

OVERALL COMBAT AID
OCC:
wearing shield and using 'smash'  25% + 24% = 50%
wearing shield and using 'focus'  25% + 20% = 45%
LAY:
wearing shield and using 'smash'  15% + 14% = 29%
wearing shield and using 'focus'  15% +  9% = 24%

Note that only one special attack can be used 
at a time, hence overall combat aid = 49%/29%
