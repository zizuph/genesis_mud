The Spellweavers are a spellcasting guild of evil alignment located
in Rhun in eastern Rhovanion.  The entrance to the guild lies beneath
an old abandoned castle, at /d/Rhovanion/common/rhun/castle/rune_room.c.
The idea/history for the guild, briefly, is that the demons and dark
spirits which once walked abroad in Middle Earth were captured behind
runes of power.  The basis for this rune-magic was taught
centuries ago by the two blue wizards who passed out of Tolkien's
Middle Earth and are not referred to in the Lord of the Rings.

Evil spellcasters have learned the ways of releasing the demons by
inscribing the runes which hold them.  At the height of their power,
these spellcasters wove runes of protection or servitude into
garments; hence, the title Spellweavers.  
But the good forces revolted, and pushed the Spellweavers into hiding
for many centuries, killing off many of their number.
Eventually, much of their craft was lost as they ran from
hiding spot to hiding spot.
After much time, the Spellweavers have begun to rise again
in power in their caves deep beneath the hills that line the south
and west edge of the Sea of Rhun, and at last emerge.  Their craft
is limited, now, but still strong.  They draw the runes to release
their demons in mid-air, speaking aloud the translated name of the
rune, and the spirit is released to do their bidding.  The number of
runes and spirits remembered and controlled by the Spellweavers is
limited, but at last they are able to emerge.

The Spellweavers guild shall be run by a Head Guildmaster,
titled Lord High Magistrate of the Spellweavers.
Upon the votes/opinions/polls/thoughts of the members of
the guild, the wizard guildmaster (me) will take the candidate 
selected by the members at large into the Appointment room, where the
candidate need only "accept" his position.
(/d/Rhovanion/common/rhun/sw/guild/gm_appointing_room)

He may select two other Assist Guildmasters, titled 
Runemaster of the Spellweavers and Master Patterner of the
Spellweavers, to help him.  They may exercise their powers while
in the Guildmaster room (/d/Rhovanion/common/rhun/sw/guild/gm_room).
These powers include:
    -Resigning their position as Guildmaster or Asst. Guildmaster.
    -Expelling a member (present in the game) from the guild.
    -Banning a player (present in the game) from ever entering the guild.
    -Removing such a ban.
    -Here the Guildmaster may appoint a First of Second Assistant; the
       First Assistant may appoint a Second Assistant.

The Spellweavers have an entrance quest, to be described in
detail in the QUESTS/ directory of /d/Rhovanion/open.
Once this is completed, the player may always reenter the guild, but
does not have access to back areas (ie, the training room).
He/she/it is to post a note on the public board there,
asking for sponsorship.  When a Spellweaver member has adventured
with the candidate and wishes to, he/she/it may go into
the shrine at the center of the guild and "sponsor" that person,
allowing them to enter the shrine, and make the pledge of their loyalty.
In the shrine, a player may meditate as in Adventurers'
Guilds; list the major guilds to which they belong; alter their
membership from Occupational to Layman or vice versa, leave the
guild altogether, etc.
(The shrine is at /d/Rhovanion/common/rhun/sw/guild/shrine.)

Any member may sponsor any number of candidates into the shrine.  A
layman member may sponsor an occupational candidate, and vice versa,
as well as sponsoring one of their own division.

A candidate must have an alignment of -300 or below to join the guild.

If the Guildmasters are of the opinion that a player has dishonored
or disobeyed the guild in some way, they are free to act accordingly.

The penalty for the leaving the guild, either voluntarily or by 
explusion, is death, and the removal (setting to 0) of the guild's
main skills: SS_FORM_CONJURATION, SS_FORM_DIVINATION, SS_ELEMENT_DEATH,
SS_ELEMENT_EARTH, SS_ELEMENT_AIR.

A guild member is free to join any other guilds they choose, so long
as their commitment to the Spellweavers remains firm (the Guildmasters
shall be the judges of this).  Guildmasters and wizards are always
open to suggestions by the members at large concerning 
problems, improvements, etc., with the guild.

The files for the guild home itself are in the directory
/d/Rhovanion/common/rhun/sw/guild/.  
The files for the soul/shadow/etc. are in
/d/Rhovanion/common/rhun/sw/s_s/.

The joinroom is shrine.c in the guild directory.
The start-here room is startroom.c in that directory.

The following includes the available skills & spells and their
tax computational values for first the occupational and then the layman
branch.  
Note that all members have a Tell-line for sending a message to
one other members, predefined at 4% tax and 10 mana in the new
man guilds.

Occupational----

Skills:
(Note that 'norm' is the amount defined for normal Adv. Guilds in man skills;
'mine' is the amt. trained in the Spellweavers guild; 'diff' is the
difference between the two values).

---------------------------------
                 Total diff: 495    /60*1%=8.25% tax for skills

Total skills taught: 90+90+40+90+50+50+40+(50*2)+(50*2)+25+25=700

(Note: Knife & defense are doubled in diff. value because it is a
skill foreign to the guild style (magic), in accordance with man guilds.
Both are counted 1.5 for tax because they are "Special fighting skills,"
as mentioned in man guilds and defined in /sys/ss_types.h.)

/d/Rhovanion/open/SPELLS/Spellweavers/.)
