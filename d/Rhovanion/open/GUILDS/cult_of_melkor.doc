The Cult of Melkor                              by Gunther 940716

1. History
<insert history of Melkor here:>
2. General description
The Cult of Melkor is a clerical guild located in Rhun.

The Cult of Melkor worships Melkor and he in turn bestows powers unto those
that have pleased them. The members continuously strive for the favor of
Melkor. There is a system of favor points. Favor points are accumulated by
obeying the commands of Melkor, holding ritual sacrifice, spreading darkness,
and by guild stat. Favor points have the following effects:
a) Affect title/guild standing
b) Affect which spells that Melkor grants
c) Affects power of spells
d) Too many negative points result in expulsion from the Cult
e) Points may be traded in for mana at not-so-good rates,
	providing an emergency resource of mana.
f) Possibly other effects
I've heard once that knights have a system of honor points. I don't know what
these points do except that you can trade stuff in for points at the keep. I
hope these points of favor will be different enough.

At times, Melkor will give the member commands. Suddenly, he will grip the
mind of the player and speak them to him. Such commands may seem
irrational to the member, but he is not allowed to question them. Possible
commands include
a) Kill that NPC! Spontaneously, when a member enters a room with NPCs,
	Melkor will demand the death of one of them. The chance depends on
	NPC alignment, stat comparison (won't command novices to kill big
	monsters). The member might not be able to do it himself, if so he must
	enlist the help of others, and fulfil the wish of Melkor.
b) Don't kill that NPC! This would be more rare. If the member is fighting
	an NPC, Melkor may give the command to spare him.
c) Go there! Melkor may take it as a whim to tell a member to go to a certain
	location. Sometimes telling more than one member at a time to go to the
	same place. It might be very out of the way for the worshipper, but he
	may not question the wisdom of Melkor.
d) Leave him! If the member is teamed, a team member or team leader might seem
	unappropriate in the eyes of Melkor. The player must then leave him and not
	join with him for a while.
e) Don't go there! Melkor may forbid a member to go somewhere, maybe a single
	room or an area.
f) Revenge! Should a guild member be killed, all others are commanded to
	revenge him. As another player might have killed the member, there will be
	no penalty for not following this command. There should be nothing to force
	a player to PK.
If you have more suggestions, please mail me! Failure to obey a command will
result in a favor point reduction, fulfilling the command will add points
(though not as many as a possible reduction).

Ritual sacrifice is a common practice of the cult. After killing something, the
member may find leftovers. These leftovers shall then be burned over fire. I'm
thinking of making a coal brazier for sacrifice available for free or low price
at the guild home. Otherwise any object with OBJ_I_HAS_FIRE is ok. The rite of
burning takes a while. It has the following effects:
a) The sacrifices gains favor points depending on the body parts. Only hearts,
	maybe scalps and eyes should count. Other parts will have no effects on the
	favor points.
b) Those watching will get slightly more panicky, depending on dis of course,
	and also on race of organ/watcher.
c) If it is possible, the air should smell of the sacrifice for a while after.
d) It should be generally nasty to those who watch.
If you got more suggestions, please mail me!

Spreading darkness is of course muchos importante. Favor points will be
connected to alignment. If you are very evil, favor points will be slightly
multiplied as they go in. If you aren't very evil they won't.

There will also be a max amount of favor points that you can accumulate,
depending on alignment and guild stat. 

As noted above, favor points can be used.
Guild title and standing (see further below on standing) will be affected
by favor points. It might not seem much but I intend to have cool titles and
a subloc worth striving for. It will be evident to other cult members how
the member stands in the favor of Melkor. Others will also be able to
suspect it.

The spells available to a member is governed by the favor points in
combination with guild stat. A high champ with negative favor points will
not have as many spells as a veteran with high favor points. Of course, the
high champ will (probably) have lots more mana to spend on the spells.

The power (outcome) of spells will be affected by favor points. Stands to
reason that if Melkor is displeased with a member, he will not spend
as much energy on spells cast by the member.

Too many negative points will result in expulsion from the guild. The member
will be informed/warned of this some time before he enters the risk zone though

Favor points can be used as an emergency reserve of mana.

3. Guild structure
The guild will be ruled by 3 Overpriests, these three being the three most
favored members. The powers of these overpriests can be exercised when at
least two of them are present in the council room at the guild home. The
powers are:
a) expelling a member from the guild
b) banning a player from entering guild
c) reaccepting a banned player
The goal of the guild is that it shall be united.

4. Rules
a) a member must follow the guidelines set up by the guild leadership
I don't see the need for more rules right now. They may join any guild
and have any alignment. Favor points will be quite impossible to aquire
(they should go down) if you are good. 

5. Spells
The elements used : DEATH, EARTH, WATER
The forms used : ILLUSION, ABJURATION, DIVINATION

a) PAIN. This is the guild's main attack spell. It is based on death and
	illusion (!). The target will get hurt within his mind.
b) SMOTHER. This spell will cause all torches and fires in the room to
	go out. Not very useful but cute. Based on water and abjuration
c) DARKEN. Darkness spell, based on death and abjuration. Does not move
	with caster
d) LUMINATE. Give the room temporary light. Based on illusion and earth
	Does not move with caster
e) MINDREAD. Sift through the head of another, picking out his true name.
	The caster can learn the name of the target. The target will still be
	nonmet to the caster though. Based on water and divination
f) ESPY. Powerful version of scry. Needs a container of water to create
	an image upon. In this image all in room can see the room of the
	target, even if it is dark. They can also see ongoing fights.
g) VEIL. The caster can make himself disappear from sight, until he attacks.
	Based on illusion and death.
h) AWARE. The caster is aware of his surroundings. Basically it is a see-
	in-the-dark spell, but the caster cannot see very much. He can sense
	obvious exits and sense creatures in the room (be able to see race names)
	Attack can be initiated and fought like normal. Might be hard to code :/
i) RESIST FIRE. Gives the caster a rather powerful resistance to fire. After
	all, there aren't very many uses for this spell (yet). It is handy when
	sacrificing. Based on water and abjuration.
j) HORROR. The caster locks a terrible image in front of the target. The
	target cannot see anything but the image, and gets more panicky by the
	second. If possible, attacks made on the victim should be seen by the
	victim as attacks by the image. The victim should be able to disbelieve
	it using wis. Based on death and illusion. Alternatively the horror could
	do some real damage
k) DISPEL. A powerful dispel spell. Cult members can combine to make it more
	powerful. Based on abjuration and death.
l) TEMBLOR. Earthquake spell. The most powerful attack of the cult. Affects
	all others in the room except the caster though. Based on earth and illusion

6. Tax draft

Tax from spells. None of the spells require a material component, which will
multiply tax by 1.5 for all, except for ESPY
Pain     .5    x1 one object
				x2 casting time < 1 heartbeat
				x1.5 difficulty simple (this is the
				guild's main attack spell, should be
				quite easy to perform)
		= 1.5%
Smother     .1    x1.5 all objects in room
				x1.5 objects in another living's inv
				x1 casting time < 5 heartbeats
				x.7 duration instant
				x1.5 difficulty simple
		= .225%
Darken      .1    x1.5 it gets dark in the whole room
				x1 casting time < 5 heartbeats
				x1 duration 1-10 mins
				x1 difficulty routine 
		= .15%
Luminate .1    same as darken
		= .15%
Mindread .5    x1 one object
				x1 casting time <5 heartbeats
				x.7 duration instant non-attack
				x1 difficulty routine
		= .35%
Espy     1     x3 object in another room
				x1 casting time <5 heartbeats
				x.7 duration instant non attack
				x.5 difficult
				x.66 material component
		= .7%
Veil     .5    x1 one object
				x1 casting time <5 heartbeats
				x1 duration 1-10 mins or until attack
				x1 routine
		= .5%
Aware    1     x1 one object
				x2 casting time <1 heartbeat
				x1.5 duration quite long
				x1 routine
		= 3%
Resist fire 1     x1 one object
				x1 casting time <5 heartbeat
				x1 duration 1-10 mins
				x1 routine
		= 1%
Horror      1     x1 one object
				x1 casting time <5 heartbeats
				x1 duration 1-3 mins
		= 1%
Dispel      1     x1.5 all objects in room
				x.9 casting time < 30 secs
				x.7 duration instant nonattack
				x.5 difficult
		= .5%
Temblor     1     x2 all objects in room cept caster
				x1 casting time <5 heartbeats
				x1 attack spell
				x.5 difficult
		= 1%
Subtotal = 10.075%
No material + 5%
Total for spells= 15%

NOTE: I would like to make the power of the spell relative to the favor
points of the caster, that is why durations are a bit imprecise. 

The cult will have a member to member tell, with 2% tax as per man guilds.

Skills:
		NORM  CULT  DIFF
Spellcraft  20 80 60
Illusion 0  90 90
Abjuration  0  60 60
Divination  0  50 50
Death    0  90 90
Water    0  50 50
Earth    0  60 60
Knife    30 50 20x1.5   (swing those sacrificial knives!)
Defense     0  50 50x1.5
----------------------------------
Total difference     565/60 x 1% = 9.5%

There will also be a shop at the guild where the members can buy good knives
and armour, and a coal brazier, all at good prices. No extra specials for
this shop (no better trade) so i'll set it at .5% to round off the tax :)

Total tax then:
	Spells 15%
	Tell  2%
	Skills 9.5%
	Shop  .5%
	----------
		= 27% tax

In my opinion a rather decent tax. The spells don't give that much combat aid.
