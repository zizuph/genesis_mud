The New Icewall - a guide and easy-to-follow situational sketch.

The undertaken project was aimed at completing the Iciewall 
region coded by Macker nearly 7 years ago.

The new icewall, located conveniently in /d/Krynn/icewall/castle2
now portrayes the true character of those icy, gods-forgotten
place. First of all, the mansion wing of the old code, where
the draconians garrison, now borders on the south side of
the true castle, where minotaurs and thanoi stand guard
over the house of the White Dragonarmy Highlord, the dark
elven mage Fael-thas /npc/fael-thas. 
Untrusting as he is of other choosen servants of the Dark Queen 
(he's sick with advance paranoia, see DL books for details)
he has blocked with draconian part of the castle with a 
'wall of stone' spell /rooms/storage4 which serves double 
purpose - first strenthens the isolation feeling within the
castle, and second keeps the old code nice and contained.
Oh, a third reason might be pointed out - thanoi and draconians
hate each others' guts.

The castle, in my humble opinion, has a very distinct, original 
climate and I truly hope you'll find the time to visit its
grounds. If not, here is a short list of places of interest.

A full map can be viewed at /map/map_new_icewall

/rooms/cliff_new
A second, secret entrance has been added to the Icewall Castle
(the one the Companions used) Be carefull not to shout there,
the avalanches hurt a bit.

/rooms/warehouse
Minos work for their god, Sargonnas. Draconians work for Takhisis.
Thanoi work for .... well, cheap wine. The wine cellar bears
a number of wine racks. Destroying them/securing them is a 
good/evil version of the quest Tasslehof the Kender managed
to complete.

/rooms/stable
The Dragon Highlord tries to use his magic to subdue a number
of griffons and use them as mounts for his minotaurs.
A young captured griffon may be rescued/secured for the
evil/good version of the quest.

/rooms/glacier4
The castle is being swallowed whole by the advancing glacier.
A skilled climber can find a sheltered niche high up the glacier.
If he survives the several slides down the glacier (and smacking
into the castle wall hurts) he may find a roc nest and a
frozen corpse bearing a magic ring of strength /obj/nice_ring.

/rooms/mino_garrison2
Here resides Hrun, champion of the arena, a really nasty and
evil-minded minotaur. He is the chief of guard, and a trusted
henchmen of the Dragon Highlord /npc/hrun. Of interest are
the weapons he has managed to collect, cloned in the unique
fashion. /obj/weapons/hrun_axe is an axe of thick head and
short handle, magicked to do wonders when wielded by a minotuar.
/obj/weapons/hrun_sword is a magic broadsword with a snapped tip.
A dwarven prince once used it as a lever to lift a stone slab,
but it stills retains much of its power, especially in the
hands of a true dwarf.

/rooms/ice_clearing2
A nightmareous arctic yeti, a half-demon creature has lumbered
from the deep wastes, drawn by the cruel murders and tortures
going in in the Highlord's castle. The beast, remembering
the time before dragons and elves, will attack anything and
everything, with only a single ghoulish thought - consume the
living /npc/arctic_yeti. Should one find a corpse of a 
Royal Guard of Silvanos frozen under a tree here, he might 
put him to rest by blessing his corpse and assuring him that
whomever he was guarding fled, as there are no other corpses
there. The anguished spirit will depart, leaving behind his silvanesti
shield /obj/armours/silvanest_shield.

/rooms/library_secret
Here, in his magic library, resides the evil Fael-thas, White 
Dragonarmy Highlord. Finding the secret entrance requires
a kender's approach to searching (see Tasslehof's adventures)
The mage is a powerful opponent, able to blind, stun, and wound
his enemies. He is also using the dragonarmy shadow.
Uniquely, he can wield /obj/weapons/fael_sword, which is
a custom-made light elven mage longsword which he carried
from Silvanesti after he got banished for dark magic.
Deeper into his lair, a treasury and bedchamber might be found
/rooms/treasury. The chests found there are protected by
magical traps. Inside of interest are the two ioun stones
/obj/green_ioun_stone and /obj/blue_ioun_stone, granting
the powers of regeneration and nightvision respectively, 
and a scroll of identification /obj/id_scroll.

/rooms/inner_courtyard
The courtyard houses a magical fountain. Long ago, at the
onset of the ice age, a Lord of this castle was abandoned
by a fair baroness. His friend the bronze dragon, seeing
how his human friend hurts, created this fountain as a
joke, to see that 'the Lord does not freeze in his bed alone'.
drinking from /obj/fountain boost RESIST_COLD by amount
defined by ones size.

/rooms/conquer1-45
To the east of the castle stretch the wide snowy plains,
now an area of the warfare system called "Icewall Plains"
to the north of the plains, the White Dragonarmy Camp
will open with the corresponding DA guild, should a 
guildmaster be found.

/rooms/snow_plain11
A ship cruising to Palanthas might be found docked in this
sheltered bay. It is assumed the griffon who up to now
carried people to Icewall from Vingaard mountains will
finally die of old age.

Also found inside are the thanoi and minotaur barracks,
Sleets (the white dragon) lair for future dragonorb quest,
and a ruined altar of Paladine.

Much more can be said of the castle, of its unique npcs
and all the subtelties so please go and visit, but for now,
I wont bore you an more!

Warm regards, 
Kessie.
ps. The project is 105 locations wide.
