Concerning the dragonlance:

Nobody knows exactly where the last one resides, but rumour has it
that one lone knight bore a mighty 'spear-like' weapon as he
headed off to Icewall. Sadly, this was before the Cataclysm so the
rumour could be nothing more than that.


Concerning Icewall:

Getting there is virtually impossible by foot. The harsh weather
and mountainous climates would prove to be too much for most
mortals. High in the Vingaard Mountains is a creature said to be
capable of covering great distances.
