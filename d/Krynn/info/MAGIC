Nightbringer    (/d/Krynn/pax/weapon/nightbringer.c)

   Creator: Jeremiah

   Modified by: Blizzard

   Hit: 45 (50 for player with align < -500)
   Pen: 40

 Special: blind.


 Old: A magical mace, only wieldable by evilaligned players.
      (Requirement: Alignment < -600)

 Now: Wieldable by all players, but those with alignment higher than 0,
      will have it lowered by value of 200. Also, they will get blinded
      for 2-5 minutes, with each attempt to wield. Evil players will have
      the weapon to_hit increased by 5 upon wielding.

      This mace is a 1 handed mace, that draws upon its powers from
      the dark queen Thakisis herself. It has the ability to blind
      its opponent when the right word of command is spoken, 'Midnight'.
      The blinding lasts for about 30 secs. This costs 100 manapoints,
      and the blinding will only be effective if the mace does damage
      in the turn where the word of command is spoken. It is avaliable
      only in combat. If the mace is wielded by Verminaard, it is also
      unbrawlable. Players with alignment higher than 100 will get hurt
      while trying to use the power word.

      It is a 1 handed weapon.

      and Dragons). The sword is given to the one who kills the slug
      crawling around in the burial chamber of Kith-kanan. The weapon is
      thus only available through combat. The old skeletal remains of the
      elven king, will give the sword to the one who slayed it.

      (Values: hit 35, pen 35). Special dam = dam + dam against dragons
      and draconians, dam * 3 against black dragons.

Sword of Fire (/d/Krynn/solace/puzzle/weapons/sword_fire.c)

   Creator: Mucalytic

      Solace Puzzle Quest. It is entirely resistant to damage
      by fire, having a resistance of 100. Pen: 32. Hit: 32.
      This sword cannot be bought, and has enchantment magic.

      *** Note the Solace Puzzle Quest is no longer open. 
      *** Nor is this sword.



Bladed Silver Staff     (/d/Krynn/haven/road/bladed_staff.c)

Creator: Morrigan


The bladed silver staff is a magical staff, blessed by the Goddess
of Neutral Magic, Lunitari. It behaves as a "normal" staff, albeit
an exceptional one, when wielded by someone who is _not_ a wizard
of high sorcery. If the wielder is a wizard of high sorcery, and is
on Krynn somewhere, Lunitari will bestow her blessings upon the
follower of the Moons, and the staff will charge itself on one swing,
then the normal swing will be replaced by a magical spell. The spell
will either be a blast of crimson light, or a shower of crimson
light that stuns the opponent for a few seconds.


Wielded by: No one, it is attained from the hooded draconian patrol
near Solace, where it appears randomly. (about 20% of the time)




Elegant Jewel-Encrusted Sabre   (/d/Krynn/solamn/splains/obj/kit_sword.c)

Creator: Morrigan

Hit/Pen: 45/40

Magical Abilities: Sentient, Speed

Wielded by:This is the sword of Kitiara the Highlord, who raids VK.


The sword is sentient, very arrogant and ambitious and seeks fame and
fortune. It is jealous, it will not allow itself to be wielded while
the attempted wielder wields another weapon, and the wielder will not
be able to wield another weapon while wielding it. It requires that the
dis of the wielder not be less than 80% of the highest stat, and sword
skill must be >= 60 for the sabre to be wielded. The sword gets angry
in battle, and will begin to glow as its anger increases. When the
fury reaches a certain level it will drain the life of the enemy. The
damage is regular damage for the sabre, but one half of it is directed
at the wielder (all of it is directed at the wielder if it is a killing
blow). The sabre adds a quickness of 33, and sword skill / 10 to parry.
It also will have a random chance to magically parry about 1% of blows
per ten levels of parry (max of 10%). The sabre is particularly jealous
of other magical weapons, and the magical parry chance as well as the
rate in which the sabre gets mad is doubled when fighting an enemy
wielding a magical weapon. Finally, when the sword is angry, there is
a chance that it will force the wielder to attack the largest of his
current enemies.



slender elven longsword (/d/Krynn/icewall/castle2/obj/weapons/fael_sword)

Hit/Pen 47/45

Creator: Kessie

Magical Abilities: Lighter weight, increased hit/pen.

Wielded by: Fael-Thas, General of the White Dragonarmy on Icewall.

This sword has been crafted in Silvanesti for a certain
promising magic user of rich standing. However, found a
user of black arts, and a traitor, he was banned from
Silvanesti, and fled with many a magic item, this sword
included.



sturdy one-bladed axe (/d/Krynn/icewall/castle2/obj/weapons/hrun_axe)

Creator: Kessie

Hit/Pen 34/38 (when wielded by minotaur 40/44)

Wielded by: Hrun, minotaur commander on Icewall.

This is a neat minotaur axe, as per the books. Due to the unique
balance, and heavy axehead, minotaurs and ogres with their huge fists
can do much more damage with it then any other race. The
enchantment upon it is minor.



lethal dragon-forged dagger (/d/Krynn/icewall/castle2/obj/weapons/wknife)

Creator: Kessie and Boron

Hit/Pen 30+random(8)/35+random(10)

Wielded by: Auraks on the whole of Krynn/Ansalon,
            Fael-thas on Icewall.


The weapon supplements the magically forged Claymores and Battleaxes for
the elite troops of Takhisis, Queen of the Abyss.

This nearly a foot long, left handed dagger looks lethal.

Its straight, solid blade has been forged with vicious
teeth set at regular intervals along a razor-sharp
edge that looks capable of cutting skin and bone in
the blink of an eye.A large "color" gem has been mounted
in a steel dragon claw at the end of the hilt, and
serves as the counterbalance.The hilt itself has
been wrapped in the skin of baby dragons.

The weapon glows with a fierce, unholy light, but what
unnerves you the most is the fact that the tiny, not
yet hardened scales on the hilt glow with a silvery
and bronze sheen, and the abominable artifact seems to
emit wails of undescribable agony.



long composite bow (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/wep/singing_bow)

Creator: Blizzard

Hit/Pen 44/42 (49/47 as humming long bow, 54/52 as singing elven longbow)

Wielded by: Qualthas in Qualinesti (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/npc/qualthas)

 The bow requires combination of SS_STR and SS_DEX to be wielded.

 It is magicial longbow, that begins to hum in hands of skilled archer,
 and if he is an elf of half-elf the longbows starts changes into 
 singing elven longbow. Its hit and pen changes also (+5 as humming and
 by another 5 as singing bow). If the wielder has at least superior layman
 in SS_WEP_MISSILE, the skill will increase by maximum value of 10 and
 if he is an elf maximum value will be 20. SS_DEFENCE will decrease by
 value equal to gained SS_WEP_MISSILE skill. While being under the 
 influeace of the bow's song, the player's quickness increase by 50.



wide eagle-shaped dagger (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/wep/eagle_dagger)

Creator: Blizzard

Hit/Pen 36/35 ( 42/41 if mastered, 28/27 after failed mastering )

Wielded by: Qualthas in Qualinesti (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/npc/qualthas)

 The dagger requires 60 in SS_WEP_KNIFE to be wielded.

 It is a powerfull artifact. The dagger images an eagle stiking its 
 victim and it seems to have its own soul. While wielding player 
 attempts to calm the dagger, what depends on resolve_task (that considers
 TS_INT, TS_WIS, TS_DIS). If it is succesfully mastered the hit and pen
 values increase, if the playes loses those values decrease. Also, during
 the fight the dagger may become wild again and then its stats return to
 normal, unless the command 'gaze into the black onyx eyes' is used. Then
 the wielded will attempt to calm the knife once again. The dagger also
 drains player's mana slowly during the fight.

jet black war-sword (/d/Krynn/pax/weapon/war_sword)

Creator: Blizzard

Hit: 49
Pen: 54

Used by: Verminaard in Pax Tharkas (/d/Krynn/pax/monster/verminaard),

         Kitiara (/d/Krynn/solamn/splains/living/highlord),

Magic abilities: the nasty special, that hits all of the wielder's enemies.


 This composite sword is similar to a great sword but due to its 
 construction it is both lighter and stronger. The sword is made 
 from up to ten strips of metal that are then twisted and forged 
 together  to give a  flexible but strong blade that  can resist 
 more punishment than a standard sword. The blade edges are also 
 combined  with carbon so  that a  sharper edge can be achieved. 
 This is why the sword has increased  damage and a lower weight. 
 It has also the nasty  special, that  allows the wielder to hit 
 all of his  enemies with  a single  swipe, and as a result they 
 may get even stunned (  time : 4 + random(4),  and for  undeads 
 time: 8 + random(4) ). After such attack, the wielder will have
 his parry and defence lowered (by 5) for one minute, however.



dwarven war-mace, "Knee-Crusher" (/d/Krynn/common/weapons/war-mace)

Creator: Blizzard

Hit: 43, (36 if wielded by non-dwarves, 50 if wielded by Neidars)
Pen: 37, (30 if wielded by non-dwarves, 43 if wielded by Neidars)

Used by: Shale the Banished member of the Neidar Clan

                  (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam-forest/living/shale),

         Colin Ironfist, the leader of dwarven merchants
                  (/d/Krynn/haven/dwarf_camp/npc/colin)


 Magic abilities: The mace has damaging special, which if hits the
      enemy's legs will make him unable to walk for a short while. 


 Ths war-mace has was constructed by the Neidar blacksmith long time 
 ago and after that  blessed by priests of Reorx and  thus it is the
 most effective in the hands of a dwarf,  especially hill one. Stats 
 of the war-mace will increase upon wielding by hill dwarves (both 
 +7). His quickness also will be increased by 33. If mace is wielded 
 by non-dwarf, its stats will go down by 7, as it was crafted for 
 dwarven hands. Since the dwarves often fight bigger enemies, like
 ogres, trolls or giants, they usually hit their legs, delivering 
 painfull blows, which may limit the mobility of those creatures. 
 And thus this dwarven war-mace has been named the "Knee-Crusher".

 Every hill dwarf using this mace will become more tired with each 
 hit. Also the offensive style of fighting leaves the hill dwarf
 more vulnerable to attacks (lowering SS_DEFENCE by 5).

 

lethal flame-bladed glaive (/d/Krynn/common/weapons/flame_glaive)

Creator: Blizzard

Hit: 37 (maximum 47)
Pen: 43 (maximum 53)

Used by: Verminaard (/d/Krynn/pax/monster/verminaard),
         the highest level auraks may wield this weapon randomly.       

 Magic abilities: It has a damaging special, which if hits the enemy's
      arms will add attack delay for a short while, but if it hits the
      legs, it will make the enemy unable to move for a moment.

 The weapon consists of a long, broad knife-like bladed attached to a 
 wooden staff. It has a wavy bladed edged on the convex side for 
 slashing and pointed at the tip for trhusting. There are also two
 smaller, crooked blades, which may be used for tearing into opponents
 body. The weapons stats depend on the wielder's SS_WEP_POLEARM skill. 

 The skill of superior layman is required to wield this weapon at all, 
 and only the high races have a chance to use it. In hands of a person 
 whose skill is higher than 55, the stats will increase slightly, but
 if he is a real master of polearm, the stats will increase even more.

 While performing the special attack, the wielder's mana is drained,
 but while being metally exhausted, he will become more tired with 
 every next special hit.

Pen: 60

    Creator : Arman

    This staff was created long before the Catacylsm by a black-robed 
    Wizard of High Sorcery battlemage. Loving the thrill of hand-to-hand 
    combat, he enchanted this staff to draw on the holders magecraft and

blackened kite-shield (/d/Krynn/common/armours/kite-shield)

Creator: Blizzard

AC: 39 (45 if used on the horseback)

Used by: Kitiara (/d/Krynn/solamn/splains/living/highlord)
         Shale   (/d/Ansalon/balifor/flotsam_forest/living/shale)
         Colin   (/d/Krynn/haven/dwarf_camp/npc/colin)

 Magic abilities: While fighting on foot, the kite-shield may be used
         for bashing your enemies.

 This shield is more suitable for protecting a mounted warrior and that 
 is why such person will receive additional 6 AC. However, while fighting
 on foot it will be recompensed, by giving the wearer ability to bash his
 opponent.  The shield has also a long strap, which allows it to be slung
 upside-down over the warrior's back while travelling.


deep-blue full plate armour (/d/Krynn/common/armours/fullplate)

Creator: Blizzard

AC: 53

Used by the Dragonarmy Highlords:

         Verminaard (/d/Krynn/pax/monster/verminaard)

         Kitiara    (/d/Krynn/solamn/splains/living/highlord)

 The armour has been created especially for the Dragonarmy Highlords and
 enchanted so it protects the wearer against magic attacks, what - this
 depends on the colour of the army; Blue - against electricity, Green -
 against poison, Black - against acid, White - against cold and finally
 Red against death and fire. The resistance is additive and of value 35.
 This will happen at the cost of mana. Since this is the best quality 
 complete suit of armour it provides excellent protection. However, metal 
 plates are limiting a mobility of the wearer so the LIVE_I_QUICKNESS is 
 lowered by 35. It requires SS_STR not lower than 80 to be worn.


scale-plated chainmail (/d/Krynn/common/armours/elite_chain)

Creator: Blizzard

AC: 43

 Used by: the most powerful auraks.

 Magical ability: Increases one of the wearer's stats by 10.

 on the colour of the army (Blue - SS_DEX, Red - SS_DIS, Black - SS_STR,
 Green - SS_CON, White - SS_INT). It requirest at least 50 in the average
 stat to be worn. As a drawback it increases greaty resistance against
 magical healing (MAGIC_I_RES_LIFE), and sets it at 75 (non-additive).

  Creator: Blizzard

  Worn by: Qualthas in Qualinesti (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/npc/qualthas)

  AC: 45 ( 50 if worn by players of elven blood)

  This strong mail is of Qualinesti elf construction. It has wyvern scales
  bound to a chain backing. Thanks to that feature is provides resistance
  against fire (30). This is elven armour and those of elven blood receive
  additional AC. Since such armours are granted only to especialy brave
  elves, it can not be worn by players with average stat below 70.

           
earth-colored firebane cloak (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/arm/firebane_cloak)

  Creator: Blizzard

  Worn by: Qualthas in Qualinesti (/d/Krynn/qualinesti/npc/qualthas)

  AC: 25
  
  This firebane cloak is treated with heat-absorbing oils from the 
  elathas plant and thus it provides fire resistance (20). Thanks to

Decorated iron champron  (/d/Krynn/solace/lake/obj/champron.c) and
                         (/d/Krynn/solace/lake/obj/mino_ac_obj.c)

   Creator: Cherek

      By default minotaur players may not wear helmets since their
      horns already provide quite good AC. However, this partical
      headpiece is a one of a kind item that will provide minotaurs
      with a small amount of additional AC. The champron is not 
      magical in itself, however, when worn it clones the 
      "mino_ac_obj", which is an invisible object that is cloned to
      the wearer and provides the small amount of magical AC. This 
      is a work-around to achieve the head armour since normal head 
      armours cannot be worn my minotaurs.

      Worn by: Toron tribe minotaur chieftain Kadez

               (/d/Krynn/solace/lake/npc/minotaur_kadez.c)

    protection, however can only be worn by the smaller races. Those smaller 
    races that aren't dwarves get an AC penalty as it doesn't quite fit them 
    perfectly. Being fullplate, it is quite heavy - weighing around 30 
    kilograms. set_likely_cond has also been set from 3 to 2, reducing the 
    chance somewhat of it wearing down.

carmine robe (/d/Krynn/turbidus_ocean/obj/ergothian_robe.c)

    Creator : Arman

    This is the traditional robe worn by those battlemages of the 
    Ergothian Empire held in highest of esteem by the royal family. 
    It is enchanted to provide great protection, dependent on the 
    wearer's skill in abjuration magic.

    This robe is worn by the Ergothian battlemage found on a ship 
    in the Turbidus Ocean, /d/Krynn/turbidus_ocean/living/ergothian_wizard.c
    This robe provides armour protection to A_ROBE of between 5 and 45, 
    dependent on the wearer's SS_FORM_ABJURATION skill 
    (50% of skill = ac value, max 45).

    It changes its adjective from dull to carmine to scarlet to crimson
    to vermillion depending on the ac value it provides.



blue-gemmed ring (/d/Krynn/turbidus_ocean/obj/ring_of_swimming.c)

        /d/Krynn/south_courrain/living/ancient_dragon_turtle.c

        This foe is a powerful (275 stat average) creature that would
        need a strong team to take down.

        Gigantic dragon turtles have a 10% chance of spawning from the
        ominous dark shape object that randomly appears in the Southern
        Courrain Sea rooms:
        /d/Krynn/south_courrain/living/courrain_water_shape.c

        The chance of the shell cloning as a leftover is based on
        CLONE_MASTER->may_clone(SHIELD, 20), which means there is a 
        declining chance of one spawning the more there are in the realms.

        It gives unrivaled protection as a shield (ac 60), as well as 
        offers resistance to acid attacks when worn (55 resistance).

Disks of Mishakal (/d/Krynn/common/objects/disks_of_mish.c)

  Creators: Percy?, updated by Teth

      A holy and sacred artifact, this is the object to be retrieved in the
      Black Dragon quest. It is difficult to get, and has no real benefits.

      However, any evil or undead creature handling this item will suffer
      some damage (for the first time they handle it). Furthermore, there
      are glyphs on the disks, that are unreadable, however, any attempt
      at doing so by an evil or undead creature will result in a death,
      5 % of the time. They are found in a chest in /d/Krynn/xak/
      caverns/cavern.c. They are protected by an aged black dragon,
      Khisanth.



Anti-magic Scroll  (/d/Krynn/common/scrolls/antimag_scroll.c)

  Creator: Teth

      This scroll is a magical item found in the chest located in
      /d/Krynn/xak/caverns/cavern.c. It is in the same chest as the
      Disks of Mishakal, an increased reward for the tougher dragon.

      The scroll, when read by someone who has the ability to read it
      (based on a resolve_task, clone the object for more info),

      then destruct. Failure to read the scroll will cause a loss of

Identify scroll (/d/Krynn/icewall/castle2/obj/id_scroll.c)

  Creator: Genesis property, modified by Kessie.

      This is a medium strength identify scroll. When recited
      over a magic item, it helps appraise the object as if

serpentine figurine (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/polymorph_figurine)

    Creator : Arman

    This curious serpent figurine made of quartz is a figurine of transformation.
    Under certain conditions, the figurine will release icy vapours from its maw
    which can be inhaled by the holder. Those vapours transform the holder into
    a white dragon hatchling. The polymorphed player then flies up into the sky
    and wings his/her way over the Tharkadan mountain range and into the vale
    overlooked by an ancient volcano. Shortly after landing the player reverts
    to normal form.

    The main purpose of this magic item is to allow players to access the vale
    when the pass is blocked by winter snows.

    Conditions of use:
           * be in an outdoor room in the Tharkadan mountain range directory 
             (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/room/*)
           * it is winter in Krynn.
           * the player is holding the figurine when activating it.

    The item makes use of the shapeshift.c base spell, which has been customised
    at /d/Krynn/tharkadan/spells/polymorph_self.c

    The hatchling form the player turns into is at:
    /d/Krynn/race/shapeshift/thark_polymorph_self_hatchling.c

    Multiple figurines in the same player/room result in them merging into one.


pale wand (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/light_wand.c)

    Creator : Arman & Carnak

    A magical wand that, when held and waved, activates a light spell - 
    (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/spells/wand_light_spell.c) that clones the SOHM light 
    spell object (/d/Krynn/guilds/sohm/spells/objs/light_obj.c). This provides
    a 15 minute light source with a light level ranging from 1 to 5 depending
    on the spell query_spell_effect_power().

    While active the light drains mana as it would a standard spell would. Upon
    releasing the wand the light the light source dissipates.

    The wand has a 1/4 chance of spawning in the cocoon corpse dropped by 
    the giant spider (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/living/giant_spider.c) in the 
    Tharkanan mountain range caverns (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/cocoon_corpse.c),
    and in the magical strongbox in the troll caves 
    (~tharkadan/room/troll_cave/troll_caves7).


magical strongbox (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/magical_strongbox.c)

    Creator : Arman

    A standard container that can only be unlocked by reciting an incantation,
    the words of which are revealed through any identify spell on the strongbox.
    SS_SPELLCRAFT of 40 and SS_FORMS_ABJURATION of 20 is required to adequately
    recite the incantation properly.

    It cannot be re-locked after opening.

    The strongbox can be found in a pile of skeletal remains one can search 
    after defeating the two-headed troll boss in the trolls caves. 
    (~tharkadan/room/troll_cave/troll_caves7).

    The strongbox in itself has a high monetary value, with OBJ_I_VALUE set at 
    12000. This is largely due to it being the only item drop in the entire 
    cave, and to reach it one needs to defeat 8 standard trolls and the 
    two-headed boss troll.
    (~tharkadan/living/cave_troll.c, 
     ~tharkadan/living/two_headed_cave_troll.c).

    The strongbox contains a multi-hued disk, which is required to complete 
    the WoHS quest to obtain the advanced spell protection from magic.
