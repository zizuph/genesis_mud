ARMAN'S GUIDE TO THE NEW THROTYL AREA - August 2020

What began as simply a linking road between the Eastern Solamnian 
Plains (ESP) and Sanction has become much more. The following 
outlines the key features of this new area.

Between the ESP and Sanction is the Stormshire forest - swarming
with hobgoblins and their ilk - then the Throtyl moors. The
Throtyl moors were once lands ruled by humans, guarded by the
famed Riders of the Moor cavalrymen. But the hordes of hobgoblins
swarmed the moor, taking over East Keep and the southern moors,
pushing the Riders in to the northern parts of the moors bordering
Estwilde.

You can access the northern entry to Throtyl from here:
"/d/Krynn/throtyl/rooms/throtyl-4-2-P"

Southern entry from here:
"/d/Ansalon/taman_busuk/sanction/room/city/sanction_entry"

Through /d/Krynn/throtyl/throtyl_placer.c the following npcs are
randomly cloned:

forest - 30 hobgoblin units (1)
south moors - 20 hobgoblin units (1)
north moors - 20 rider units (2)

(1) hobgoblin units that could spawn consist of:
    * goblin archer (5% spawn chance, stat average 112-125)
    * hobgoblin looter (65% spawn chance, stat average 125-170)
    * aggressive bugbear (10% spawn chance, stat average 155)
    * ogre marauder (15% spawn chance, stat average 170)
    * ogre magi (5% spawn chance, stat average 190)
    /d/Krynn/throtyl/living/hobgob.c

(2) rider units that could spawn consist of:
    * outrider / lancer / dragoon (96% spawn chance, stat average 
      155-190)
    * horse archer (4% spawn chance, stat average 170) 
    /d/Krynn/throtyl/living/moors_rider.c

While the hobgoblin npcs do not have any magical items, rider
units have a chance to spawn with a magical lance, that has an
increased 'pen' value if mounted.

BOSS FIGHT
In the northern moors bordering the mountain range is a dwarven
tomb containing the mad restless ghost of a Neidar dwarven thane.
/d/Krynn/throtyl/rooms/dragon_lair.c

The ghost is a very difficult battle, with normal damage 
mitigation, magic resistances, and the special attacks and abilities
of a Doomseeker Neidar dwarf.
/d/Krynn/throtyl/living/thane_ghost.c

Also in the tomb is an opportunistic adult red dragon, lairing
there awaiting tomb robbers.
/d/Krynn/throtyl/living/r_dragon.c

The sarcophagus of the thane is guarded by a poison trap that
requires disarming, otherwise all living in the room suffer
a 2 minute SS_CON poison.

The ghost has the chance of wielding a powerful two-handed
warhammer, 'Kinslayer', that does not dull and does extra 
damage against humans and dwarves.

THROTYL RAIDERS - A NEW LAYMAN FIGHTER GUILD.
In the southern moors in the ruins of East Keep is where
the hobgoblin invaders now base themselves. Players of
an evil bent and of appropriate race (goblin, hobgoblin,
ogre, human, drow) may join, receiving some layman-level
fighter skills as well as access to a unique bleed special
attack, 'wound'. Guild details in the following file:
/d/Krynn/guilds/hobgob/TAX.txt

NEW WoHS SPELLS:
In this region, two new WoHS spells can be sourced. One
linked to an abandoned temple in northern Sanction, the
other linked to an object dropped by the Thane ghost that
requires the player to travel to the Tharkadan Mountain
Range.
