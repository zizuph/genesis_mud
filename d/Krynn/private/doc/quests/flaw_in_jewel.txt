Exploration Quest: Flaw in the Jewel of Solamnia
================================================

In this quest, if you find your way to the balcony spire at the top of the
palace in Palanthas you can look out north, east, west and south. The lighting
changes according to time of day. If you look to the west or south, your
attention will be drawn to the Dark Tower in the Shoikan Grove to the 
southwest.  This is the "flaw" in "the Jewel of Solamnia" -- Palanthas --
according to Laurana Kanan, the Golden General. If you are evil and <fixate on>
the dark tower in the evening or nighttime, you gain experience. If you are good
and <fixate on> the tower in daylight, you gain experience. Otherwise, you get a
message suggesting to check back at another time.

Reward: 120 XP
