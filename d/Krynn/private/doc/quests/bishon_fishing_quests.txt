Bishon can be found at:

All the quest code resides in him.

Quest 1: Bishon Fishing Quest 
          3500 quest xp reward

         For this quest Bishon requires the player to fish
         for him a Balifor bonito, a fish that can only be
         caught in the Bay of Balifor.

         To achieve this, a player must learn the Krynn
         fishing system which requires purchasing a fishing
         rod from the crusty seadog on the docks of Palanthas
         ~solamn/palanthas/shipping/living/seadog_seller.c

         The seadog sells bait, but if the player asks the
         seadog about the Balifor bonito he'll tell them
         that his simple earthworms won't be good enough
         bait to catch a bonito, and that better bait would
         be needed. He suggests bardee grubs, that can be
         found in the bark of trees on the isle of Mithas.

         Once the player has the rod and bait, he can fish
         from the deck of a ship in the Bay of Balifor
         for a bonito.  Success at catching a fish requires
         some level of SS_HUNTING skill... the higher the
         skill the more likelihood of success.

         Once a Balifor bonito is caught it can be taken
         back to Bishon for the quest xp reward and a 
         free fish platter! (available on the menu)

Quest 2: Bishon Shark Fin Soup Quest
         3000 quest xp reward

         For this Bishon asks the player to bring him
         5 shark fins from a great white shark... a creature
         (~100 stat average) that randomly spawns from
         /d/Ansalon/goodlund/bloodsea/living/water_shape.c
         all over the sailing areas of Krynn/Ansalon.

         To find these water shapes where sharks spawn, you
         either need to charter a boat or having be a 
         sailor and sail your own ship to these locations.

         Not only do you need to kill the shark, but you
         also need to be holding a net 
         (/d/Calia/sea/objects/fish_net.c) to catch the 
         corpse before it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

         Carving the corpse in the net gives a fin leftover,
         of which five can be handed in for a quest reward.

Quest 3: Bishon Black Noodles Quest         
         5000 quest xp reward.

         Similar to the Shark Fin Soup quest, Bishon requires
         a rare ink sac from a collosal squid, that can only
         be found in spawns in the South Courrain Sea
         /d/Krynn/south_courrain/living/dark_shape.c

         The collosal squid is much harder to find and kill
         than sharks, with a 154 stat average and a blinding
         special attack.

         Upon returning the ink sac, the player is rewarded
         with quest experience and given 2 gold coins.

Quest 4: Bishon Swimming Potion Quest       
         10000 quest xp reward.

         For this quest Bishon initially wants the player to
         retrieve the recipe of a potion of swimming, that 
         was lost at sea. The ship that held the recipe
         is wrecked on a beach east of Palanthas
         /d/Krynn/turbidus_ocean/room/beach2.c that can only
         be accessed by a skilled sailor or a semi-expensive
         charter ship with a skilled captain from 
         /d/Krynn/solamn/palanthas/shipping/charter_room.c.

         in ~beach2.c the sand can be searched and a key found
         if you are participating in the quest.
         The chest that unlocks it is underwater to the north
         of the beach, requiring AG level swim skill to access.

         The chest contains the recipe Bishon seeks
         /d/Krynn/solamn/palanthas/nobles/obj/bishon_potion_scroll.c
         Upon returning the scroll to Bishon, he realises the
         primary ingredient he needs to make the potion is the
         heart of a sea lion, so he sends the player off to get
         one.

         Similar to the collosal squid from the Black Noodles quest,
         the sea lion spawns randomly in the South Courran Ocean via 
         the /d/Krynn/south_courrain/living/dark_shape.c
         The sea lion is a legendary creature (stat average ~170)
         with a special attack, so a tough fight. On returning the
         heart to Bishon, he tries to make the potion without
         success... ruining the components in the process.

         Bishon asks the player to make him a potion of swimming
         for him... the player may either make one based on the
         instructions in the recipe, or can source a potion from
         elsewhere (such as some npc drops) and give it to
         Bishon.

         Upon receiving a swimming potion Bishon rewards the player
         with quest xp and 2 platinum coins.
