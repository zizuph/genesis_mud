 There could be a possible quest to do. A player will have to find lost
 elven scouts, who did not return from a patrol. Informations about the
 possible location of scouts will be given to the player (location #P on
 a map). There will be a wounded elf hiding in bushes, who will tell a 
 player about the fight, that took place. He will also tell him that 
 draconians led the other elf to Pax Tharkas for interrogation. He will
 have to be freed. After returning to the camp, the elven leader will
 tell the player how to get to Qualinost (an entrance to the location 
 *F will be revealed to the player from now) and give him some magic 
 item maybe (a bow, poisoned arrows?).

 An evil version will be given by an aurak in Pax Tharkas. The player 
 will have to torture an elf *grin evilly* to get informations about the 
 location of the camp. Then the player will have to map the camp 
 (probably kill all the elves too) and report back to the aurak. Aurak 
 will mention to the player that he managed to get from the prisoner 
 informations about the location of Qualinost (an entrance to the 
 location *F will be revealed to the player from now). Maybe a magic
 elven sword, that aurak took from the prisoner, will be given to the
 player.
