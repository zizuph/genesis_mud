Solace
On the eastern side of Crystalmire Lake about a mile from the shore is the village of Solace. No ordinary human village, this town is unique in that the majority of homes and businesses of Solace are constructed in the branches of the massive vallenwood trees found in the valley surrounding the lake.

Regarded as one of the beauties and wonders of Krynn, this town has a few places of note.  
Firstly, the Inn of the Last Home, the largest building in Solace. Renown for its famous potatoes, this inn is extremely popular with locals and travellers alike.

Secondly, the house of the Questmaster. Residing in a vallenwood just east of the Inn, its mysterious occupant has a number of tasks of varying difficulty for the willing adventurer... tasks of which the adventurer is well rewarded!

To get to Solace, one can catch a boat from the port town of Sparkle to Newports.  From Newports it is a short walk past Gateway to the northwest, or an even quicker ride on a magical boat to the shores of Crystalmire Lake!
