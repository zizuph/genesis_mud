Krynn
Krynn, a land only beginning to recover from the wrath of the gods, who punished the mortals of this land around 350 years ago for their pride and arrogance with an age of darkness and famine that reshaped the world for all.

Rumours of war sweep the land, and even darker rumours have begun, only whispered in the shadowy corners of the loneliest of Inns, rumours of the return of dragons. The fearful citizens of this shattered world seek someone to lead them from these shadow years. Clearly, the time for heroes is at hand.

As an adventurer of Genesis, explore the <A HREF="/d/Krynn/novels.txt">Dragonlance world</A>! 

Travel through the vallenwood trees of <A HREF="/d/Krynn/solace.txt">Solace</A>, visit the Inn of the Last Home for some of Otik's famous potatoes! Travel south along the border of the elven lands of Qualinesti to the mighty fortress of Pax Tharkas. 

Explore the ruins of Xak Tsaroth, or make your way north to the lands of Solamnia where you can fight with, or against, the honourable Knights of Solamnia or evil Dragonarmy forces who battle for dominance of Krynn. For the less combative, seek an audience with the renowned historian Astinus at the <A HREF="/d/Krynn/library.txt">Library of Palanthas</A>.

Travel to Kendermore, home of the insatiably curious kender (but keep an eye on your pouches!), or <A HREF="/d/Krynn/mariner.txt">become a mariner</A> on the high seas and sail to the eastern Isles where the minotaurs battle for glory! For the brave, or foolish, venture to the city of Neraka where the centre of the Queen of Darkness' power resides. 

For those just after a strong drink or some good old fashion ogre bashing, travel to the village of Iron Delving in southern Estwilde, where a clan of hill dwarves reside.

Regardless, there is much to discover in these lands! Unique races, lost gods, fantastic creatures, and <A HREF="/d/Krynn/characters.txt">characters</A> both heroic and villanous! So make space in your map book, dust off that ancient family sword, and charter a ship to the <A HREF="/d/Krynn/krynn_map.txt">continent of Krynn</A>!
