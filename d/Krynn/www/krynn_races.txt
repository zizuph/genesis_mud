Krynnish races
Flicking through a few of the tomes on the races of Krynn, you read about:

<B>Abanasinian Humans</B>, a sturdy race that rebuilt their homes and lands with vigour after the Cataclysm, and are now one of the more successful regions of Ansalon. The tribal names of Que-kiri, Que-shu, and Que-teh are typically nature-based.

<B>Solamnian Humans</B>, hailing from the northern part of Ansalon, these humans are a strong race with strong ideals. From a nation founded by Vinas Solamnus, they are members of the largest human province on Ansalon.

The two main tribes of Elves who separated after the Kinslayer wars. The original tribe being the <B>Silvanesti</B>, found in the southeast corner of Ansalon. Silvanesti elves tend to be very reclusive, rarely trusting strangers. The tribe which broke away was the <B>Qualinesti</B>, found in the southwest corner of Ansalon. Built around the city of Qualinost, these elves are more open to trade than their cousins.

A group of Elves which rejected advancement in civilization are a race of Barbarian elves, the <B>Kagonesti</B>. They are extremelty nature-oriented, and druidic by nature.

<B>The Dark Elves</B> are not a racial group, per se, but rather elves that have cast aside the light and have delved into evil. When outcast, they are stripped of their last names, and thus their families and heritage. There are no known Kagonesti dark elves on record.

The <B>Hill Dwarves</B> of the Kharolis Mountains, also known as the Neidar, live in a region of Krynn populated by many other races, including the humans of Abanasinia and the elves of Qualinesti. They live in isolation from their other dwarven counterparts due to a long-standing rivalry. They are, however, a merry people, hard-working and strong.

In the spot where the tome on the gnomes of Krynn once was is a burnt spot and some blackened springs and whistles. No doubt there are some more books on this race and their <B>Guild of Tinkers</B> in their hilly home just outside of Sparkle.

The tome on the <B>kenders of Krynn</B> seems to have been borrowed! In its place is a map detailing the western lands of Kendermore, where a secret path has been scribbled in going under a bridge, along the bank, to a great tree which is marked with a big X... probably of interest to the insatiably curious!
