Library
Welcome to the Great Library of Palanthas, one of the most ancient buildings in Krynn! Within these hallowed halls resides the reclusive Chronicler Astinus, the immortal being who records Krynn's history, and the Order of the Aesthetics who oversee the needs of the library and its master.

While the greater part of the library is not open to the public, those parts that are, are of great value to those individuals who wish to find their <A HREF="/d/Krynn/krynn_heritage.txt">Krynnish heritage</A>. There is even rumours that in one of the vaults of the library is a shard of the Greygem of Gargath, and even wilder rumours about those humans who had come in contact with it transforming into mythical beasts!
