TODO:
* Gunthar needs a flowchart, so that the 'Disks' quest is only given out
  once per cycle, the same goes for the Icewall quest.

* The Black dragon army will attack Solace if the 'Disks' isn't found in time.

* If Verminaard is killed, no attack on Que Kiri, otherwise it will be.

* Verminaards death will start Ariakas time-line.

* Make all timelines reset by the clock.

* Have Gunthar deliver the broken dragonlace from Icewall to Theros, if
  not captured by Kitiara, that is.
