As part of the revamp of the warfare system, two goals was
to broaden participation across the playerbase, and allow
players to keep record of their participation and how the
war is going.

The warfare club allows anyone to participate with one
of the following armies (with some restrictions dependant on
guild choice... Priests of Takhisis can't support the knights
for example!):

* Knights of Solamnia
* Neidar Clan
* Free People of Krynn
* Red Dragonarmy
* Blue Dragonarmy
* Green Dragonarmy
* Black Dragonarmy
* White Dragonarmy

Existing participants are automatically joined up to the club
for their respective armies (Knights, Neidar, Dragonarmies).

Priests of Takhisis may choose which of the five Dragonarmies
they favour, and may switch between the five at the Temple of
Neraka as they see fit.

Members of the club have access to a number of commands that
allow them to:
* list their warfare achievements
* view a report on how the war is progressing
* list a player leaderboard based on current war achievements
* display earnt war titles based on previous participation
* hide their membership to the club

In conquering areas, members accrue 'steel coins', a currency
unique to Krynn, that may be spent in the forge of Theros Ironfeld
in Solace for masterwork equipment, that can be enhanced by items
randomly dropped on the battlefields.
