Some emotes for you to consider :)

Lets's start out with some emotes allowing us to be slightly rude
to people being rude to us. *grin*

wsmirk [target] (target being all,none, name,elf,elves etc)

	Mhyrmarius smirks <at target> in a slightly condescending
	manner, apparently amused <by his/her/their ignorance>.

wrubbish [target]

	Mhyrmarius dismisses [targets] opinions as utter rubbish.

wignore [target]

	Mhyrmarius <adjectively> raises the hood of his robe and
	starts to ignore <target> (or everyone).

wdismiss [target]
	
	Mhyrmarius <adjectively> waves a hand in <targets> direction
	saying : <text>

wcurse [target]
	
	Would be nice if it compared for example guild stat with DIS
	or something and then had special results like.
	
	<target> laughs at Mhyrmarius' pathetic powers.
	<target> remains calm and completely undisturbed
	<target> squirms, feeling a bit uncomfortable.
	<target> goes pale, obviously fearstruck by Mhyrmarius' powers.
	<target> collapses, trembling with fear of Mhyrmarius'
		 powers, begging for forgiveness.

wbow
	Could we have an opportunity keep the hood on please ?
	perhaps wbowhood if we want to remove the hood.
	Perhaps the females could be able to bow also ? 
	I feel no urge to curtsey, but not all females wishes 
	to do so either.

wlaugh
	white robes - Mhyrmarius bursts out in a hearty laughter
		      which leaves him gasping for breath.

	red robes - Rocque laughs out loud, leaving an amused
	            smile on her lips.

	black robes - Wilwarin laughs menacingly, a moldering
		      decaying sound of dark pleasure.

wcautious [target]
	
	Mhyrmarius looks around [or at target]  with caution,
	ready to use his powers	at the first sign of danger.
		
wclean (spell ? )

	Mhyrmarius waves his hands in a cryptical pattern,
	while uttering a wooshing sound, and suddenly he and
	his clothing is impeccably clean.
	
	Work against Kabal sweat and dirt, shire puddle dirt,
	goblin dung.

wdry (spell ? )
	
	Mhyrmarius utters a word in the spidery language of magic,
	and suddenly all water on his body disappears in a cloud of
	steam.
	
	Works to remove Icewall wetness.

Thats all for now.
I can even provide code for the emotes if you wish :)

Mhyrmarius Istanandus.
