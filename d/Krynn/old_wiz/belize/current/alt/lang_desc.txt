This document describes balance and technical properties of the WoHS language.

Each understanding check is made for two skills: Spellcraft and Language.
Language in the check is a bit more important, thus has weight = 400,
while spellcraft's weight = 300.

The result is percent of words understood in one sentence.

Following checks has been made in a 1000 cycle loop, so they are
rather realistic ;-)


Here is it:

Most people won't be able to pick any word at all. Some more skillful
of them, will be able to pick sometimes single words. Notice, that
usually average value is a bit lower, than average of max and min.
It means, that results reaching the max value are quite rare.

Here are some characteristics of it:

 o  Each word which is not understood is replaced by another, strange
    sounding word of similiar length. (+/- 1 letter).
 o  Each nod-understood word, which is said and heard by the same people,
    when repeated looks still the same. Let's say that if XXX says
    in the language 'test', and YYY understands 'lomak'. Each next time,
    when XXX says 'test', YYY will understand 'lomak'.
 o  The property explained above is valid only between the same reboots.
 o  If ZZZ hears 'test' said by XXX, he will hear somthing else, than YYY
    did. In other words, the language is by each person understood in
    a diffrent way.
 o  Not-understood word is supposed to sound a bit familiar. Which is
    meant to fool those, who try to guess meaning of sentence.
    (this may not work properly though, at least now doesn't ;-)
    It depends on set of *parts variable, which is used in
    construction of words).
 o  People with INT < 30, spellcraft < 20 or language < 30 will
    not hear anything at all.

Thats all folks
