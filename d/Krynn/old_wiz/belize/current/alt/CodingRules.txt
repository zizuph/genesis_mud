Here are some rules of creating new words. (when there is needed an not
understood word). All this stuff is coded into language_obj.c
Function code_word() is responsible for creatnig one word.

First, function gets needed length. It also checks for chars like
'!' '?' '.' at end of the word, so it would pass it at end
of the new word. But.. if person doesn't understand the language, how
would he know if it is question, or anything else? One of these
three chars is randomly picked. Also, the word after such mark
gets capitalized.

Then it start to make the new word. It looks how many chars are to be 
added yet, and accordingly to that number it randomly picks 
a part from the *parts variable. Generally, it tries to avoid
1-letter parts, and uses it only, if the needed length is 1.
That is because words made of 1letter parts sound ugly and look not nice.
Following rules aree set to ensure this:

needed length:
1	- only 1-letter part can be used
2	- only 2-letter part can be used
3	- only 3-letter part can be used
4	- it picks 2 or 4 letter part
5	- picks 2 or 3 letter part
6	- picks 2 or 3 or 4 letter part
...	-            -||-

Hope it makes some sense :)
