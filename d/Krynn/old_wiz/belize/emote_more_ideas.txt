Here are some emote ideas I've come up with:

wnote
Xiandra's pen smoothly glides accross the parchment as she meticulously scribes
information into the back of her spellbook.

wnote <target>
Xiandra silently nods at Melchar as she carefully jots down his instructions 
into her spellbook.


wsort
Xiandra sorts through her spell components, carefully selecting the
appropriate reagents for her purposes.

wsearch
Xiandra searches through her scrolls, nodding slightly as she selects the
parchment containing the information she was looking for.
