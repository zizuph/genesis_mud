The writing on the monolith reads:

Welcome to this land, wizard. This area coded between the 23rd of January and
the NNth of February 1996. Thank you for coming to this place and please think
of all the great wizards over the years who have coded lands more impressive
than this but have had to retire from their creative persuits. I, at this
point in time am also having to consider life without wizardhood because my
time at University is growing near to ending. You never know, I might write
other areas after this and find more about my life as on this monolith,
however just in case, I thought I'd say hello now. Hello!

Greatest wishes for the future;

Sir Mucalytic.
