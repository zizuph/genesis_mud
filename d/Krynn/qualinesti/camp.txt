   
   The elf camp in the Qualinesti forest 
   -------------------------------------

   The camp has been set by a group of Qualinesti elves who are here  
   to keep an eye on moves of the Verminaard's forces.

  * - means exits in nw,ne,sw,se directions

  H - an entrance from Haven-Solace road
  N - an entrance from Newports-Pax Tharkas road
  R - the path leading to the camp through the forest
  CMP=, =CMP - entrances to the camp
  C - the camp
  J - the Elven Archers join room.
  A - a location with an ambush set for intruders
  O - a location with an elven leader
  f - a standard forest location
 #P - a small clearing - visible after getting a quest (an elven
      leader will give some hints how to find it) 
 #F - a path leading to Qualinost (only a view on the city for now) -
      visible after doing a quest
  Q - view on Qualinost (possible entrance to the city later)

  NPCs:
  -----
  elf warriors - with some standard equipment, elven bows or longswords,
             light elven chainmails, boots etc.     

  Qualthas - Elven leader, equiped with a magical long bow, that gives 
             quickness and missiles skill when wielded and maybe a bit 
             more quickness if wielded by an elf (evil people will not be 
             able to use this weapon at all). He randomly could wield an 
             elven longsword and a dagger instead of a bow (these items 
             could be magical in some way too). He will be wearing a very 
             light elven chainmail (of AC around 45), sleeves and greaves.

  some animails - living in a forest that surrounds the camp. 
 

  A path leading to the camp will be sourounded by a forest. Some 
  skills (location sense, tracking) probably will be needed to find this 
  camp. Before an entrance elves could set an ambush for evil people who
  try to enter the camp, because to enter one will have to go around 
  a big tree, that blocks the way or something like that. This would 
  take a few seconds giving elves time to send a few arrows in a direction 
  of intruders. Good aligned people will not be attacked. Elves will be of 
  course good aligned. I am thinking of creating a few trees that elves can
  shoot from at enemies.
