@@ At the beginning of the doc can we summarise what the guild is,

Skills:
=======

+++ Yes riding is listed as a generic skill, should we count

+++ pets with a .5% tax boost in the pet presence skill boost?

@@ Yeah I think that is probably a good idea unless you can think
@@ of an alternative skill that could be boosted for non-riders, like
@@ tracking or hunting?

Skills in this guild are not trained through a guildhall, they are an
arduous process of actually using the skills in order to acquire them.
The cost of increasing skills remains, as the pet requires food. While
it can eat alot of different foods, only food that actually cost you
money will be awarded with growth potential. This is indicated by the
pet showing its satisfaction.

@@ Can we add the cost it takes to train using food vs cost for
@@ if training in a standard adventurers guild. I am sure that will
@@ be a question asked.

Skills Tax: 0,75%

Special abilities:
==================

The maximum capability of pet_attack and reduce damage is 50% combat aid,
so tax for specials is maxed.

Special Tax: 8.3%

Miscellaneous Specials Perks:
=============================

-- Mount / (Messenger + Scry):
   The guild is based around a mount and therefore the mount is not taxed.
   The guild has two other abilities (Messenger + Scry):
   Messenger:      1.0%
   Scout:          2.0%


+++ The scout ability now takes 15 seconds, the cost is minimum 10% of the
+++ pets max fatigue, based on max fatigue and dexterity. The pet is unable
+++ to scry in waters unless waterdweller, unable to scry on or from boats
+++ unless it can fly.

@@ Can the details such as this be added to the two perks descriptions. Always
@@ good to outline the limitations.  Also, can we check for the room prop
@@ ROOM_IN_AIR for those pets that can't fly in the same way we check for 
@@ underwater.  Not many of those rooms, but they do exist :)

   Tax: 3%


-- Pet_Attack:
   Having an external special ability would mean it ignores stun to the
   player, this would be quite powerful, but as this ability comes with the 
   negative aspect of having a chance of actually not being there, and being
   able to accumulate wounds. I have decided to set this as a low taxing perk.

   The ability starts has a guild xp modifier of 60/150, while it starts at
   a high value, it has a penalty of requiring alot of time and work for it
   to raise its skill. This should not be taxed.

@@ Is the xp modifier still 60/150 considering the formula change below? 

   Tax: 0.4%

>>> I really hate the reliance on guild xp for the special attack, but can't
>>> be helped. Seems like it is built in to the standard special base.
+++ This has been changed, formula for gaining skill for the pet attack
+++ is currently !random(((skill * skill) / 3) / maturity)

@@ Can we add the formula to the pet attack summary, and also a description
@@ of how it works... how often is this formula called? When something is slain?
@@ Or when their ability is used?  So is it low skill and high maturity results
@@ in a fast gain of skill?  Can we add an estimate of how long it would take
@@ to max the skill?

>>> apply_costs_to_player(object player) .. am fine that the player
>>> doesn't get fatigued by the special, but can we figure out a way
>>> for it to be applied to the creature? I think the standard is -2 fatigue
>>> per special attack (add_fatigue(-2)).
+++ The cost for the ability is 3 fatigue or 6 health if the pet is too
+++ fatigued to use the pet_attack.

@@ Can we add the penalty to the pet attack summary

>>> query_combat_aid_modifier() checks for SS_MOUNTED_COMBAT, however
>>> according to the tax doc and animal balance doc only SS_RIDING is 
>>> trained?
>>>
>>> Also in the config_ability function it has set_skills(({ SS_MOUNTED_COMBAT }));
>>> How does that impact on the special?
>>>
+++ SS_MOUNTED_COMBAT is checked in the pet, not the player, as the
+++ pet is the one executing the special. The pet can get 100 in the skill.

@@ make note of this is the notes of this special.


-- Presence:
   The animal increases your skills with its presence, the skills increased
   are based on the animal, but all are non-combat and capped by the caid
   this ability costs, or 15 if the ability is cheap.
   (For further details look in the Animal_Balance file)

   Tax: 0.41%

@@ Are the presence skill level bonuses also influenced by how much a pet
@@ has been fed (i.e. a proxy skill training)? If so highlight that the 
@@ bonuses are paid for and scale depending on how much the pet has been
@@ fed.

-- TManeuver:
   Being able to save your pet from harm seems as a basic ability, but I
   have decided to tax it, as I have stated wounds as a negative aspect
   of the pet_attack being a low taxing perk.

   Tax: 0.1%

-- TArmour:
   Being able to equip your pet with armour, while costly, reduces the
   chances of the pet dying.

   Tax: 0.04%

-- TCalm / TAssist / TKill:
   All players can stop a fight between another player, I see no reason to
   tax the player for this ability. The same with attacking a target.

-- Skill Training:
   They dont have a guildhall, but skills are trained when the pet uses
   them. The cost of the skills is based on how much money the user has
   spent feeding the pet, so no tax is required for this.

>>> Can you provide an example with animal handling maybe? How does a new
>>> Tamer improve their animal handling from zero?
+++ Feeding pets, and anything in game that checks for animal handling has
+++ a chance !random((skill * skill / 3) / maturity)

>>> I had a quick look at pet_menu.c and thought it may be a good idea to 
>>> check LANG_IS_OFFENSIVE(x) when creating a name for the pet. Its in
>>> <language.h> ... 
+++ Added!

Overall Tax:
    Skills:      0.75%
    Specials:    8.30%
    Perks:       2.95%
    ------------------
                12.00%


>>> Overall looks really good. I like it. A few things I am not clear on:

>>> releasing pets... if a player does release his pet, what does that mean. 
>>> They leave the guild? If not, what is the penalty for pet swapping?? We
>>> don't want it to be a common thing, so a decent penalty would be in order?
+++ Releasing a pet to the wilds leaves the guild. If you tame a new pet when
+++ already having a pet, you start over with the new pet. At the moment, this
+++ means your special starts from 0 aswell.. too harsh?

@@ No, i think the penalty is appropriate. How many pets can you have/train? 
@@ I was thinking just one... but sounds like you thinking along the lines 
@@ of more than one potential pet?

>>> I didn't find a guild object. How do players figure out what their help
>>> menu is?
+++ When the tamer examines the pet, s/he will see the following:
+++ You may 'help tamers' for further information on the guild.
+++ He can eat quite a lot more, is extremely alert and unencumbered.
+++ He seems to be feeling very well.
+++
+++ Do we need more? Could add a reminder when logging in?..

@@ If the pet isn't summoned, that could be an issue. How about the initial 
@@ 'rescuing' of the pet involves the removing of an arrow head or something
@@ like that (can be a selection of items maybe) that can be turned into a 
@@ pendant or necklace or earring or something... but doubles as a guild object?
@@ Just an idea. If you think it is ok without it, it may not be a big deal.
@@ Something we can beta test.
