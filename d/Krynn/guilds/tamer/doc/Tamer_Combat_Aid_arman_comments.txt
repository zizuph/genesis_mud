    Combat Aid
    ----------
    The pet_attack has been set to a combat aid of 50, but if it is
    used at the same time as the damage reduce ability it is reduced
    to 30 caid. (modifier * 12 / 20)
    
    The ability scales with the pets skill, which is mounted combat,
    this skill is increased as the pet fails to use the ability.

    It is reduced by 10% for every wound that the pet has sustained
    upon "death". It can sustain a maximum of 5 wounds, every wound
    lasts for 24 hours.
    
    If the pet is under attack, the ability effect is reduced by 50%.

    performance of 7 seconds.
