Skills Tax: 0,75%

Special abilities:
==================

The maximum capability of pet_attack and reduce damage is 50% combat aid,
so tax for specials is maxed.

Special Tax: 8.3%

Miscellaneous Specials Perks:
=============================

-- Mount / (Messenger + Scry):
   The guild is based around a mount, but not all pets are mountable, if
   a player picks a pet that is not mountable, that pet has instead two
   abilities (Messenger + Scry) to replace the loss of having a summonable
   mount and the ability that comes with being mounted (reduced damage).
   Keep in mind that no combat aid is lost.

   Summonable Mount: 2%
   Messenger:      0.5%
   Scrutinize:     1.5%
   Tax: 2%

-- Pet_Attack:
   Having an external special ability would mean it ignores stun to the
   player, this would be quite powerful, but as this ability comes with the 
   negative aspect of having a chance of actually not being there, and being
   able to accumulate wounds. I have decided to set this as a low taxing perk.

   The ability starts has a guild xp modifier of 60/150, while it starts at
   a high value, it has a penalty of requiring alot of time and work for it
   to raise its skill. This should not be taxed.

   Tax: 0.4%

-- Presence:
   The animal increases your skills with its presence, the skills increased
   are based on the animal, but all are non-combat and capped by the caid
   this ability costs, or 15 if the ability is cheap.
   (For further details look in the Animal_Balance file)

   Tax: 0.41%

-- TManeuver:
   Being able to save your pet from harm seems as a basic ability, but I
   have decided to tax it, as I have stated wounds as a negative aspect
   of the pet_attack being a low taxing perk.

   Tax: 0.1%

-- TArmour:
   Being able to equip your pet with armour, while costly, reduces the
   chances of the pet dying.

   Tax: 0.04%

-- TCalm / TAssist / TKill:
   All players can stop a fight between another player, I see no reason to
   tax the player for this ability. The same with attacking a target.

-- Skill Training:
   They dont have a guildhall, but skills are trained when the pet uses
   them. The cost of the skills is based on how much money the user has
   spent feeding the pet, so no tax is required for this.

Overall Tax:
    Skills:      0.75%
    Specials:    8.30%
