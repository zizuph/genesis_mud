   Comments: A greater spell that clones an object - a fog of 
   dark shadows - to the room that provides DARKNESS_PASSIVE 
   level of darkness (2 levels). Fog objects can be stacked.

   The spell object stays in the room and doesn't follow the 
   caster, and also changes the ROOM_S_DARK_MSG and 
   ROOM_S_DARK_LONG for the duration of the spell.

   Need 60 levels in Illusion to cast, so without enhancement
   items this can only be cast by a SoHM who has specialised
   in Illusion (base skill is 50, specialisation is +25).
