   Comments: A powerful stoneskin spell type protection spell.

   Need 60 levels in Transmutation to cast, so without enhancement
   items this can only be cast by a SoHM who has specialised
   in Transmutation (base skill is 50, specialisation is +25).

   Can't be cast if similar defensive spells are active
   (blur, magic shield, reflect damage)

   If active, lesser offensive spells (lightning bolt, flame
   lance, ice strike, psychic blast) can't be cast.
