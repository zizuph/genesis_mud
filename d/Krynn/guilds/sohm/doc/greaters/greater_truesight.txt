   Comments: A dark vision spell that offers between 1 and 5
   levels of LIVE_I_SEE_DARK depending on spell power:
   
   darkness_sight = min(5, ftoi(itof(power) / 100.0)).

   The spell also offers 10 levels of LIVE_I_SEE_INVIS, and up
   to 30 levels of SS_AWARENESS depending on spell power:

   awareness_bonus = min(MAX_AWARENESS_SKILL_GAIN,
                     ftoi(itof(power) / 15.0));

    // Int/wis of 100, spell skills 75 / 100
    //             spell power:    302 / 317
    //       dark vision bonus:      3 / 3
    //        see invisibility:     10 / 10
    //         awareness bonus:     20 / 21

    // Int/wis of 200, spell skills  75 / 100
    //             spell power:     364 / 384 
    //       dark vision bonus:      3 / 3
    //        see invisibility:     10 / 10
    //         awareness bonus:     24 / 25

   In most cases, the dark vision bonus will be between 2 and 3.

   This spell can be cast on other livings.

   Need 60 levels in Divination to cast, so without enhancement
   items this can only be cast by a SoHM who has specialised
   in Divination (base skill is 50, specialisation is +25).
