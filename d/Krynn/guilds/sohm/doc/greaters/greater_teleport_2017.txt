   Comments: A standard teleport spell, allowing the caster to
    teleport to a pre-determined (visited and marked) location.

    The number of locations is restricted depending on whether
    you are SoHM or WoHS.

    SoHM are limited to three locations they can set to teleport
    to.  WoHS can set up to 10, starting with 3 and increasing
    by one per level up to level 7.

    There is a recast cooldown on this spell reliant on the guild
    skill Arcane Focus: 
            90 minutes - (arcane_skill) minutes.

    For a WoHS there is no cooldown at Superior Master arcane
    focus, while SoHM have a maximum of 75 arcane focus skill so
    will always have a minimum 15 minute cooldown on their
    teleport spell.
