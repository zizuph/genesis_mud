School of High Magic
--------------------

“A mage’s soul is forged in the crucible of magic. You choose to go voluntarily 
into the fire. the blaze might well destroy you. but if you survive, every blow 
of the hammer will serve to shape your being. every drop of water wrung from you 
will temper and strengthen your soul.” — Antimodes, Soulforge

BACKGROUND
This is the magic school in Solace that Raistlin attended prior to him
taking the Test to become a Wizard of High Sorcery. This is planned to 
be the precursor guild for the Wizard of High Sorcery.

This guild will be occupational, although there is scope for offering a layman 
option for "dabblers" in the Art (like the elf Gilthanas).

According to the novels, the School of High Magic in Solace was called 
Poolbottom,and was run by a Master Theobald. The Poolbottom guildhall can be found
at /d/Krynn/solace/poolbottom/ .

Allowed races - Elves, drow, humans, gnomes, half-elves, hobbits (non-kender)

LEVELS
There are 9 levels for occupational Students of High Magic (SoHM).

    Occupational titles			
========================================
1.  Fresh Tyro of Sorcery               
2.  Minor Student of Sorcery            
3.  Student of Sorcery                  
4.  Lesser Apprentice of Sorcery         
5.  Apprentice of Sorcery                           
6.  Lesser Novitiate of Sorcery          
7.  Novitiate of Sorcery                 
8.  Devoted Novitiate of Sorcery         
9.  Experienced Novitiate of Sorcery        

At level 9 an occupational SoHM title depends on their spell form
specialisation:

Abjurer of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery (Abjuration)
Conjurer of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery   (Conjuration)
Enchanter / Enchantress of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery  (Enchantment)
Evoker of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery (Evocation)
Illusionist of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery (Illusion)
Transmuter of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery (Transmutation)
Diviner of Ansalon, Aspirant of High Sorcery (Divination)

If they haven't specialised by top level (unlikely!) they will default to 
Experienced Novitiate title.

ABILITIES
SoHM are able to scribe spells they find in to their spellbook.

Spell categories:
CANTRIP - cosmetic skills that provide no combat aid and minor in-game utility. 
This would include such spells as 'read magic', 'speak with dead' 
(chance to find out how a corpse died), 'fools curse' (adds prop to stop 
shopkeepers from buying an item), tell, and restricted light spell. These are
taxed as either class 0 or class 1 spells.

MINOR SPELLS - basic combat spells (such as magic missile), and simple utility 
spells (detect magic, water breathing). These are taxed as class 2 or class 3
spells.

LESSER SPELLS - your average spell, decent damage and protection spells 
(lightning bolt, shield and resistance spells) and utility spells such as 
mend item or identify magical objects. Class 2 or class spells.

GREATER SPELLS - powerful spells that do good damage, with useful utility 
spells such as nightvision. Class 3 or class 4 spells.

ADVANCED SPELLS - extremely powerful spells, accessible only to experienced 
Wizards of High Sorcery. These spell are unavailable to SoHM.

A SoHM (and WoHS) gains spell 'slots' as they increase in level. These slots 
are quite limited (3 to 11), however a SoHM will be able to 'study' the spells 
they have collected and stored in their spellbook into a slot, allowing them 
to change the spells they have memorised depending on their spell requirements.

A spell memorised can be cast as often as the SoHMs mana allows.

How often a SoHM can change the spells in their memorised slots will depend on 
a special guild skill, "Arcane Focus" and the spell category:

Cantrip - a base 3 hours cooldown to unmemorise a cantrip.
Minor spells - a base 6 hours cooldown to unmemorise a minor spell.
Lesser spells - a base 12 hours cooldown to unmemorise a lesser spell.
Greater spells - a base 24 hours cooldown to unmemorise a greater spell.
Advanced spells - can't be cast by SoHM members (exclusively for WoHS members).

This base is modified by * (100 / max(10,arcane_focus_skill)), meaning the base
time to be able to again unmemorise a spell can potentially be as high as 10x
for a magus unskilled in Arcane Focus.

Members of the SoHM can learn Arcane Focus up to level 75, meaning all base times
above are increased by a third.
