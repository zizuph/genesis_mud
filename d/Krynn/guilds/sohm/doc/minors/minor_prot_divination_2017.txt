   Comments: Provides the target of the casting protection from
             scrying by adding the LIVE_I_NO_SCRY prop.

             There is always a chance of the protection failing
             with the overall protection being based on the
             spell power of the casting.

             Scry protection % = min(95, (spell_power / 4))
