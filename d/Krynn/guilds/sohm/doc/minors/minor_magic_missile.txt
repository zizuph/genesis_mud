   Comments: At will damage spell.  This spell is identical to
   three other at will damage spells that can be memorised by
   SoHM, with the only difference being the element and, in one
   case, the spell form [magic missile, flame dart, prismatic
   spray, and acid arrow]

   Having a number of fast casting/low combat aid damage spells
   will allow players to customise themselves to be 'glass
   cannons' - focusing on damage spells at the cost of defensive
   and utility spells.
