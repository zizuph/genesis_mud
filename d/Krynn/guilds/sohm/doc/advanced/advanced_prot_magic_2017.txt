   Comments: A protection spell offering up to 37% resistance
   to a _magic_i_res_* type of the spellcasters choice.

   Combat aid applied is 30%, modified by there being only one
   type of magic benefit provided by the spell (modifier of
   / 0.8).

   This spell is influenced by the WoHS moon phase feature, so
   combat aid can fluctuate on average by ~+ or - 25%. See
   /d/Krynn/guilds/wohs/doc/WoHS.txt for specifics.
