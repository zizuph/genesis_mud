   Comments: This spell adds a unique property to the caster,
             "_wohs_stellar_alignment_spell_prop"

             This property allows team mates to leverage off
             beneficial moon phases of the caster in relation
             to providing higher guild rank progression 
             experience ratio, as well as removing the negative
             combat aid penalty to advanced spells from negative 
             moon phases.

             This spell was developed to promote teaming across
             the WoHS orders.

             This spell does not provide positive combat aid
             to team members from beneficial moon phase the
             caster may have.
