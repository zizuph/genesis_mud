   Comments: A standard stoneskin spell type protection spell.

   Can't be cast if some defensive spells are active
   (stoneskin, haste)

   Can't be cast with advanced offensive spells detonate or 
   eruption.

   This spell is influenced by the WoHS moon phase feature, so
   combat aid can fluctuate on average by ~+ or - 25%. See
   /d/Krynn/guilds/wohs/doc/WoHS.txt for specifics.
