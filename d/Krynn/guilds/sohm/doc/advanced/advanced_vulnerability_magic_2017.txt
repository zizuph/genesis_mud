   Comments: A curse that reduces the "_obj_magic_i_res_* prop
      of the target. The amount reduced depends on the power of
      the spell casting and moon phase, with the maximum base
      reduction being 37:

         magic_vulnerability = - (max(1, min(37, power / 8)))

   * is the resistance type reduced, and until the caster reaches
   a senior rank in the WoHS (level 10 of 13) this reduction is
   limited to the specific ELEMENT the caster has specialised in
   (i.e. _obj_magic_i_res_fire).

   Once the caster reaches level 10, * the caster may select the
   ELEMENT damage type to reduce.

   The duration of the spell has a large random fluctuation
   depending on spell power:

   duration = power / 3; 
   duration = (duration / 2) + random(duration / 2) + 
               random(duration / 2)
   
   So for a spell power of 300, duration is between 50 to 
   approx 150

   This spell is influenced by the WoHS moon phase feature, so
   combat aid can fluctuate on average by ~+ or - 25%. See
   /d/Krynn/guilds/wohs/doc/WoHS.txt for specifics.
