   Comments: One of the apex spells of the WoHS is the ability
      to polymorph one self in to various beasts / forms. Each
      form has its own specialty, and attributes dependent on
      SS_INT and SS_WIS. Creature skills and natural weapons and 
      armour classes dependent on caster SS_FORM_TRANSMUTATION 
      skill. 

      NOTE: while in shapeshift form the spellcaster loses all
            maintained spells and loses all access to their 
            spells and equipment. 

      Offensive forms - bonuses to str/dex; good natural weapons;
                        poor/average armour class.
