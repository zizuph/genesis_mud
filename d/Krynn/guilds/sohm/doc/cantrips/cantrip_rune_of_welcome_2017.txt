   Comments: This is a cantrip accessible to higher ranked 
      WoHS members. It adds the prop "_live_i_am_invited"
      to the target, which allows the target to then pass
      through the Forest of Wayreth and into the courtyard
      of the Tower of High Sorcery.

      Largely a cosmetic/convenience spell with no real benefit.

      High skill and difficulty rating to reflect that while
      it is a cantrip, it is only one for high ranked WoHS. It
      is not a spell meant for SoHM.
