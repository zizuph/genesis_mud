   Comments: This is a cantrip accessible to WoHS members. 

   It tears a rift in time and space, which is a summonable
   container, /d/Krynn/guilds/sohm/spells/objs/reskafar_rift.c

   This container is controlled by the summon spell object,
   /d/Krynn/guilds/sohm/spells/objs/reskafar_obj.c 
   which allows the rift to remain in place for 30 seconds 
   before being removed, making this container essentially a
   temporary trash can.

   There is a mana penalty when this spell ends, draining
   25% of the casters maximum mana pool.
