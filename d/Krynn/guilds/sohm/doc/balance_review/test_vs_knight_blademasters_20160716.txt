Arman,

Here's some interesting stats from an initial fight with the
rotating of the 3 at-will specials with enchant weapon and
stoneskin active. Based on my own calculations, the total
combat aid should be around 120 + 40 + 120 = 280% combat aid.

I ran this against a Knight/Blademaster who has theoretically
around a 150% combat aid (with kheroism), and of course the
SoHM won all 10 out of 10 battles. The final health of the
10 winners were:

The test sohm defense is somewhat hurt.
The test sohm defense is suffering.
The test sohm defense is hurt.
The test sohm defense is in a bad shape.
The test sohm defense is slightly hurt.
The test sohm defense is somewhat hurt.
The test sohm defense is hurt.
The test sohm defense is in agony.
The test sohm defense is aching.
The test sohm defense is hurt.

Here are the actual stats and damage values.
