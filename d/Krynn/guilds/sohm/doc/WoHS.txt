WoHS will be a seperate guild to the SoHM, although to join the WoHS you need 
to have first reached a certain level of competence in the SoHM.

The base code for the WoHS can be found in /d/Krynn/guilds/wohs/

===============================================================================
Wizards of High Sorcery
===============================================================================

The plan is that occupational SoHM will be able to take the Test to become a 
Wizard of High Sorcery (WoHS) from level 9 (top level, Aspirant of High 
Sorcery). At this point they will be able to access the Tower of Wayreth south 
of Haven. 

The Test will involve several things: A test of a mage's knowledge of magic, 
problems that demand the casting of key spells that an initiate knows, a test 
that cannot be solved by merely using magic, combat against someone that the 
initiate knows as an ally, and combat against someone or something considerably 
more powerful than the initiate. 

Failing the Test results in death.

Successfully completing the Test allows the SoHM becoming a WoHS, and also dictates 
what branch of the WoHS they join - the White (good; alignment > 200) the Red 
(neutral; 1000 > alignment < -1000) or the Black (Evil; alignment < 200). 

The Test will essentially be the guild's guru quest.

WoHS will (may? haven't decided completely yet) be occupational, with minimal 
restrictions on layman class selections. 
Dragonlance lore has a number of characters who have been WoHS as well as other 
classes (e.g. Ariakas Red Dragon Highlord, warrior/WOHS; Feol-Thas White Dragon 
Highlord, WoHS/fighter; Par Sailen's replacement at the head of the WoHS white order 
was a WoHS/mariner).

ABILITIES
Apart from slightly more skill levels in Arcane Study, and access to more spells, 
WoHS benefit from the phases of the Krynn moons.

There are three moons of magic - Solinari, the White Moon; Lunitari the Red Moon; 
and Nuitari the Black Moon (whose aspect only Black Robe wizards can see).

When a Wizard's moon is at High Sanction, they gain either increased effectiveness of 
spells, reduced mana cost of spells, or removal of component requirements for certain s
pells.  

Multiple moons at high sanction provide enhanced number of benefits - one moon at High 
Sanction one benefit; two moons two benefits etc.  Mind having all three moons at High 
Sanction is a rarity.

Can currently query the moon phases through /d/Krynn/common/clock/clock.c -> query_moon_phase(x), where x is either
Solinari, Lunitari, or Nuitari.

Phases are:
#define MOON_PHASES      ({"full", "waning three quarter", \
			   "waning half", "waning quarter", \
			   "waning crescent", "new", \
			   "waxing crescent", "waxing quarter", \
