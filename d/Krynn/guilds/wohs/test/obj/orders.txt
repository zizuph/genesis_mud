Imperial Speculatore, war between Istar and the Orders of High
Sorcery is imminent.

Following the failed assassination of Kingpriest Beldinas by the
wizard Andras Rannoch, the forces of all that is holy have lost
patience and will rid our world of the dark menace that is arcane
magic.

The Kingpriest in his righteousness has provided us with a means
of bypassing the protective enchantments of the groves surrounding
the Towers of High Sorcery, so they will no longer be able to hide
from our wrath!

The Knights of the Divine Hammer plan on beginning this war against
magic by assaulting the Tower of High Sorcery at Losarcum. This
is to be our signal to attack the Tower of Daltigoth, and the Knights
of Solamnia to assault the Tower of Palanthas.

But my honour can wait no longer. The deaths of my eldest two sons
in the assassination attempt on the Kingpriest must be answered
immediately. With the blessings of Emperor Gwynned our war begins
now.

The barriers of the Tower's grove should be weakening. I beseech
you to scout passage through the grove. We will begin our assault
upon your return.

Go in the name of the Emperor,

Duke Serl Kar-thon, Praetor-General of the Imperial Armies.
