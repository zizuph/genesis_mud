WoHS will be a seperate guild to the SoHM, although to join the WoHS you 
need to have first reached a certain level of competence in the SoHM.

The base code for the WoHS can be found in /d/Krynn/guilds/wohs/

==========================================================================
Wizards of High Sorcery
==========================================================================

JOINING THE WIZARDS OF HIGH SORCERY:

An occupational SoHM will be able to take the Test to become a Wizard of 
High Sorcery (WoHS) from level 9 (top level, Aspirant of High Sorcery). 
At this point they will be able to access the Tower of Wayreth south of 
Haven. They will also need to have been invited to take the Test by one
of the three Conclave guild leaders to be able to access the Hall of Mages,
where the High Mage of the Tower Par-Salian administers the Test.

The Test involves several things: A test of a mage's knowledge of 
magic, problems that demand the casting of key spells that an initiate 
knows, a test that cannot be solved by merely using magic, combat against 
someone or something considerably more powerful than the initiate. 

The aspirant is a solo quest, with failure resulting in death.

Successfully completing the Test allows the SoHM becoming a WoHS, and also 
dictates what branch of the WoHS they join - the White (good; alignment 
trustworthy+ (> 190) the Red (neutral - can't be damned or holy; 909 > 
alignment < -929) or the Black (Evil; alignment unsympathetic or less 
(alignment < -240)). 

The Test is graded, with those performing exceptionally well provided
with enough guild experience to start at second level (Wizard of the
Ninth Circle).

The actions of the Aspirant will also determine which Order they initially
join, with their alignment changed to reflect that Order - White (good) 
Red (neutral) or the Black (Evil). 

The Test is the guild's guru quest, and the code for it can be found at
/d/Krynn/guilds/wohs/test/

GUILD SLOTS:

WoHS will take up the occupational and layman class slots. 

LEVELS AND TITLES:

Guild level is reset upon becoming a WoHS.

1.  Lesser <colour> Wizard  [successful Test at level 9 SoHM]
2.  Wizard of the Ninth <colour> Circle
3.  Wizard of the Eighth <colour> Circle
4.  Wizard of the Seventh <colour> Circle 
5.  Wizard of the Sixth <colour> Circle
6.  Wizard of the Fifth <colour> Circle
7.  Wizard of the Fourth <colour> Circle
8.  Wizard of the Third <colour> Circle
9.  Wizard of the Second <colour> Circle
10  Wizard of the First <colour> Circle
11  Greater <colour> Wizard
12  <Colour> High Wizard
13  High Mage of the Order of the [colour] Robes

Guild levels will be gained through combat and general experience, 
although will be accrued outside of the brutality system. It should be a 
considerably slower experience gaining levels in the WoHS compared to the 
SoHM. 'Experience' points are added to Krynn domain skill 
(WOHS_GUILD_STAT 108701) through the guild shadow. Combat guild xp is 
modified depending on the phases of the Krynn moons (see moon phase 
details below):

    int guild_stat = WOHS_GUILD_STAT_FORMULA(query_shadow_who());

    WOHS_GUILD_STAT_FORMULA(x):  
    (x)->exp_to_stat((x)->query_skill(WOHS_GUILD_STAT))

    // 37 million guild exp or 240 guild stat for top level
    return MIN(MAX_GUILD_LEVEL, guild_stat / 20);

	/* Combat experience applied to a base max brute factor and
           a guild tax of 38%.    Base brute modifier set to 95%
           Base brute will be modified based on spell casting behaviour */

        masking add_exp_combat(int exp):

        new_exp = ftoi(itof(exp) * (0.05 + moon_mod) * 0.38);

        moon_phase == "night of the eye", moon_mod = 0.10;
        moon_phase == "maximum", moon_mod = 0.05;
        moon_phase == "partial", moon_mod = 0.02;
        otherwise moon_mod = 0.00;

It is possible to change Orders, although the penalty is having a large 
proportion of your guild stat removed.

Council titles: 
Guild leader - Grand Master of the Tower of Wayreth 
               [currently an npc, Par-Salian, who runs the Test]
Order leaders - Master/Mistress of the Order of the [colour] Robes
              - Order leaders may invite aspirants to take the Test as well
                as manage the library and access to training/storage rooms.

Other additional titles:
Renegade, Exile of the Tower of Wayreth - the greatest punishment an Order 
                                          leader can give out to a member 
                                          is exiling them and declaring 
                                          themRenegade. They cannot kick 
                                          out members,however exiled 
                                          members can no longer enter the 
                                          Tower of Wayreth, cast spells 
                                          with maximum moon penalty, and 
                                          get booted from the guild if they 
                                          die.

Renegade Hunter - additional titles can be applied to Wizards who have 
                  personally got the killing blow on a Renegade. This 
                  promotes active hunting of those exiled :).

ABILITIES
Apart from slightly more skill levels in Arcane Study, and access to more 
spells, advanced WoHS spells are impacted by the phases of the Krynn moons.

There are three moons of magic - Solinari, the White Moon; Lunitari the Red 
Moon; and Nuitari the Black Moon (whose aspect only Black Robe wizards can
see).

Moon phases are dictated by the Krynn clock (/d/Krynn/common/clock/clock.c). 
A "Krynn day" is approximately 48 minutes. There are 8 moon phases, with 
each moon taking differing lengths of time to complete a phase.

Phases are:
#define MOON_PHASES      ({"full", \
                           "waning gibbous", \
			   "waning half",  \
			   "waning crescent", \
                           "new", \
			   "waxing crescent", \
			   "waxing half", \
			   "waxing gibbous"})

Solinari takes 36 Krynn days to complete the 8 phase moon cycle (4.5 Krynn
days, or 216 minutes, per phase); Lunitari takes 28 Krynn days to complete
the 8 phase moon cycle (3.5 Krynn days, 168 minutes, per phase); Nuitari 
takes 8 Krynn days to complete the cycle (1 Krynn day, or 48 minutes, per 
phase).

When a Wizard's moon is at High Sanction (i.e. full), they gain a combat 
aid bonus to some of their spells. They get a partial bonus when their moon
is gibbous. If new or crescent they get a combat aid penalty. Overall the 
benefit over time balances out. 

When all three moons are at high sanction (full), known as the "Night of 
the Eye", all WoHS get a big combat aid bonus. This event happens 
approximately every 504 Krynn days (i.e. every 4 days) for 48 minutes.

Moon phase bonuses (advanced spells only):
Night of the Eye (all three moons full): 40% bonus

Maximum benefit (25%): full
partial benefit (10%): waxing 3/4, waning 3/4
no benefit: waxing half, waning half, waning quarter, waxing quarter
partial penalty (-10%): waning crescent, waxing crescent
Full penalty (-25%): new 

If a WoHS falls outside of their alignment range then they suffer a 
negative penalty as if their moon was permanently "new", and the title 
"Grey Wizard / Lesser Grey Wizard / Grey High Wizard".

A Grey Wizard may apply to join a different Order from the head of their 
respective Conclave. The Grey Wizard will have their guild stat skill 
reduced by 75%, reducing their level considerably!

Max total levels = 900

  Skills which are alien to the guild style should be offered only in
  a very limited way. So for example a thief guild might offer defence
  or parry up to level 30, or a fighter guild could offer two magic
  skills up to level 20. Skills alien to the guild style count twice
  towards the sum of levels which the guild may offer *above* the
  limits in 'man skills' (you do not apply this penalty to the
  taxation of the skills which are alien).


SPELLS TAX
==========
At maximum level a WoHS will be able to cast 22 spells:

14 (+10) 'cantrips' - spells of class 0 or class 1 spell type
6 (+2) 'minor spells' - spells of class 2 or class 3 spell type
3 (+1) 'lesser spells' - spells of class 3
2 (+1) 'greater spells' - spells of class 3 or class 4 type
2 (+2) 'advanced spells' - spells of class 4

Bracket number indicates how many additional spell slots they can 
potentially have over what the maximum number the SoHM offer.

For taxation purposes we'll use the highest taxed spell for each 
spell level (see ~guilds/sohm/doc/tax_doc.txt for full spell list):

Cantrips: 	0.15% + 0.15% + 0.15% + 0.15% + 0.15% + 0.15% + 0.15% + 0.1% + 
                0.1% + 0.1% + 0.05% + 0% + 0% + 0% (1.4)
Minors:		0.5625% + 0.5625% + 0.5625% + 0.5625% + 0.5625% + 0.375% (3.1875)
Lessers:	0.375% + 0.375% + 0.375% (1.125)
Greater:	0.75% + 0.6% (1.35)
Advanced:       1.125% + 1.125% (2.25)

Total spell tax = 9.3125%

COMBAT AID
==========
1% of tax will be charged for every 25% combat aid.

Max combat aid at any one time for an occupational + layman caster is 
330 Caid.

Maximum combat aid scenarios our outlined below (SPELL TIER AND INDIVIDUAL 
SPELL COMBAT AID table).

Total max potential combat aid: 330 (325 under AoB revision for occ+lay guilds)
Total max potential combat aid tax: 13.2% (13.0%)


Occ + layman, Caster | 330 Caid (325 Caid)


NOTE: Mindful WoHS have a max SS_DEFENCE of 60 (~0.8 caid benefit from defensive
skills), and that melee guilds tend to have at least 180 defensive skills
across defence/parry/acrobatics that provide 120+ caid of defensive benefit, it
is proving to be a massive balance issue for these magic guilds since the
changes to white hit damage in 2021.

Taking this in to consideration, the spell blur (kadenadon) and greater magic
shield (jennufethos) may be cast without the usual spell stacking restrictions 
other defensive spells have. This equates to a 'bonus' 72 and 36 caid that does 
not count towards their combat aid cap, however the spellcaster will still need 
to include it as one of their three lesser and one of their two advanced
spell slots respectively.
