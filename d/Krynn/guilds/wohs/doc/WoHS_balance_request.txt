****  These files are not for review... the polymorph base spell
****  is too buggy at the moment with too many issues. So while a cool
****  and fun spell, it needs a lot more work before it can be introduced
****  into the game. Right now this spell is parked.

3. Describe the benefits that players receive by interacting with your
   submission.

The Wizards of High Sorcery is the natural extension of the School of 
High Magic, although has a guild council and more strict rules of behaviour.

This guild allows players to play a stereotypical wizard character of the
Higher Arts in one of three Orders dictated largely by alignment - the
Order of the White Robes, the Order of the Red Robes, and the Order of the
Black Robes. It should be noted that while alignment dictates the Order a
player is a part of, the Orders are all brothers and sisters in magic and
have a bond stronger than their views on morals and ethics. Brothers and
sisters may fight on occasion, but at the end of the day they are all
family.

The guild will provide access to 'advanced' spells that haven't been exposed
to in Genesis before - such as AoE harm spells (and polymorph self spells)
and will provide Genesis with expanded dynamics and meta for players to
explore.

The guild will also provide the game with another non-niche magic guild that
will help transition the game from being purely melee guild focused. 

4. Describe the thematic justification for the benefits that the player
   will receive.

The theme of the guild is heavily guided by Dungeons & Dragons and Dragonlance
concepts... very stereotypical magic user. The primary 'feature' that the
guild will have is that their spells will grow stronger or weaker depending
on the phase of the magical moon they follow... which again was a feature of
pen-and-paper Wizards of High Sorcery from Dragonlance lore.

5. Describe the downsides that the player will experience that justify
   the balance of the submission.

None. Although the plan is progression through the ranks is slow. Only the
very dedicated over time will achieve the full benefits of the guild.

6. How has the submission been tested to ensure that balance is maintained?
   If no testing has been done, how can the AoB team help with this
   testing?

A lot of the spells are extensions of existing spells. Beta testing is planned
in parallel with the AoB team review to get a holistic feel for the spells on
offer.
