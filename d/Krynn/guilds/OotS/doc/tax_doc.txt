Holy Order of the Stars proposed taxation doc.

BACKGROUND:
===========
The Holy Order of the Stars is a layman clerical guild reflecting the 
traditional pen and paper/D&D cleric roles, with a focus on healing,
buffs, and anti-undead abilities.

Thematically, the Holy Order of the Stars is the fledgling order of
disciples converted to the 'Old Gods' of Krynn who had been absent for
almost 350 years following the Cataclysm, that brought an Age of 
Darkness to the lands.

With the discovery of the Disks of Mishakal and the conversion of the
charismatic ex-slave of Pax Tharkas and Highseeker Elistan, the faith
is in its early stages of rebirth... still translating the teachings
of the Disks, with no established institution to support them.

Because of this they are classed as layman only. And while the pantheon
of the Gods of Light numbers 7, only three can be followed by players:

Mishakal the Light Bringer - the first god to return to the realms.

Kiri-Jolith - god of righteous war, patron of the knights of Solamnia
and honourable minotaurs.

Branchala - the Bard King, beloved of kender.

The guild technically has no start room or guild hall, however can board
for free at the Inn of the Last Home. 

TOTAL TAX:
==========
Skills + spells + combat aid = 5.39% + 4.65% + 2.0%

12.04% (rounded to 13%).

SKILL TAX 
=========    
Layman:
  The maximum amount of skills a layman guild can offer is limited to
  350 taxable slots. 

  The maximum teaching level for mudlib defined skills is 60 for those
  skills cost multipliers are 1.0 or less.  Skills that have a
  multiplier (such as SS_WEP_SWORD) over the 1.0 multiplier can not be
  trained above the 50 level.

Mudlib defined skills are generally taxed 1% tax for every 60 levels

  depending on what other prayers are active.

       Knights and the Holy Order of the Stars
==========================================================

The Knights of Solamnia were founded on the 
religious ideals of three gods of Good, Paladine 
and two of his sons, Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk. Each 
god sponsored one of the Orders of the Knighthood 
and chose to impart certain lessons to the Knights in 
his Order. Habbakuk and Paladine chose to espouse 
specific virtues and guide the Knights of their Orders 
mainly through their words. Kiri-Jolith chose a more 
direct approach, establishing within his Knights of the 
Sword a sub-order of priest-knights called the Order 
of Clerists.

Knights of the Order of Clerists are not truly 
priests and do not belong to the church of Kiri-
Jolith. They are, however, the spiritual backbone of 
the Order of the Sword, which is in turn the spiritual 
backbone of the Knights of Solamnia. Clerists are 
the embodiment of all that Kiri-Jolith stands for in a 
righteous warrior, personifying the tenet of courage 
melded with spirituality, which is the Measure of the 
Sword. Clerists have such dedication to the Measure 
of the Sword that Kiri-Jolith grants them the ability to 
access his divine power.

MEASURE OF THE SWORD
The Measure maintains that the next components of 
honor are Heroism, Courage, and Spirituality. This is 
the Measure of the Sword.

A strong spirit and faith in the patron deities of the 
Knighthood form the spring from which courage and 
heroism flow. Courage is the will to strike a blow for 
the cause of Good, no matter what the personal cost. 
Heroism is this same spirit of self-sacrifice, dedicated 
to defending the world against the forces of Evil in 
all of its forms. The heroic, courageous Knight is a 
champion of the weak, defenseless, oppressed, poor, 
enslaved, and falsely accused, and he always renders 
aid to those in need.

While no truly courageous and heroic Knight 
would run from a battle or decline combat with an 
Evil foe, the Measure does recognize that it is fruitless 
to throw oneself away in a battle that cannot possibly 
be won. The Measure teaches a Knight prudence in 
choosing his battles and that it is better to live to fight 
another day than to die in a battle that cannot be won.

A Knight of the Sword must pay homage to Kiri-
Jolith and the other gods of Good each day. A Clerist 
must spend one day a week fasting with prayer to 
Kiri-Jolith at sunrise, noon, and sunset. A Sword 
Knight must eagerly engage evil opponents without 
needlessly throwing his life away, protect the weak 
and defenseless, and foreswear the use of his Knightly 
powers for unrighteous reasons

Minotaurs and the Holy Order of the Stars
===============================================================

Kiri-Jolith is the second most prominent deity of the 
minotaurs, and the rival of Sargas.  He appears to the 
minotaurs as a bison-headed minotaur with a great horned 
axe.  

Minotaur followers of the Great Bison tend to be the 
most noble and honorable among their race, yet they can 
be reviled and even persecuted for their beliefs among 
their own people, even resulting in being cast out by their 
families, and exiled from their homeland.  Kiri-Jolith is 
often referred to as �Emperor� by his minotaur followers, 
as they can openly swear an oath �by the Emperor�, which 
other minotaurs mistake for meaning the emperor of the 
minotaur empire.

Minotaurs are an honour-bound race. They believe 
strongly in preserving their honour and emerging 
victorious in the struggle for dominance in Krynn. Their 
brutish heads belie the keen minds within; many are 
smarter than the average human. 

Above all else, minotaurs value their honour. Without 
honour, they have no life. They live by a rigid code of 
honour, developed over the years in response to many 
hardships. This code embodies the minotaur way of life. 

Like all races, minotaurs recognize all of the gods, 
however they rank Sargonnas as the highest among them 
and Kiri-Jolith and their war patron. However since the 
Ansalonian minotaurs are also a sea-faring race many of 
them also worship Zeboim. They view the gods of good, 
with the exception of Kiri-Jolith, as insufferably weak, like 
their followers. 

Kender and the Holy Order of the Stars
===============================================================

True kender revere all the gods, as well as a number of 
nature spirits, eldritch beings, and potted plants, so as 
to not hurt any deity's or spirit's feelings. True kender 
experience spiritualism in the world around them, through 
the songs of bards or the animals of the forest, for example. 
The gifts of the gods are everywhere for all people to share. 
Sometimes a traveler will drop a gift of the god, and so the 
kender will keep hold of it for safekeeping.

Branchala, above all other gods, represents the kender 
spirit. A kender's heart beats in time with the Song of Life, 
the music of Branchala the Songmaster. True kender love 
music and song, and have a strong connection to nature. 

Branchala is considered the highest god of the kender. His love 
of music and enthusiasm for life is embraced by all kender. 

Kender clerics of Branchala wear garishly-bright yellow shirts 
with green leggings.
