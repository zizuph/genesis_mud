Revelations provide the disciple with information about the Gods and past 
events influenced by the Gods.  They are unlocked through exploration and
doing certain actions.

They collection of revelations does have a minor influence on level
progression, with the more enlightened the player is from revelations
the more experience you get attributed towards your guild stat
(see notify_you_killed_me(object victim) function in the guild shadow).
