#define NEW_DESC "The DistillationApparatus resembles an ingenious array of tubes, pipes, " \
 "bowls and valves. Since most them are made from glass you are able " \
 "see what is happening inside.  A small funnel may be opened when " \
 "liquids are to be filled into the CentralCavityContainingLiquidFuels. " \
 "The Distillationapparatus is directly connected to the Steamengine " \
 "and the WaterDispenser to allow automatic transfer of the fuels. " \
 "It is driven by excess heat of a running Steamengine thus using " \
 "valuable energy which would otherwise be wasted.\nA tiny label reads:\n" \
 "This product of Gnomish Industries runs automatically. " \
 "'Open funnel' to fill it with liquids. Do not forget to 'close funnel' again. " \ 
"To have a look at the contents, 'check distillationapparatus'.\nRefer to " \
"the help for more information on its usage.\nInvented by Dante.\n"
