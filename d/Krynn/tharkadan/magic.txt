snow-white pelt (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/armour/pelt.c)

    Creator : Arman

        A leftover cut from the corpse of a winter wolf
        (~tharkadan/living/winter_wolf.c). The winter wolf appears
        in two locations. The first is when the winter snows 
        close the path through the Tharkadan mountains. The second
        is a short summoning by the ogre magi. So considered a 
        rare spawn!

        20% chance of spawning on the corpse.

        Armour: A_ROBE 30

        Provides the wearer with 25 cold protection.

    Creator : Arman

    The tightly braided length of thick black hair from the head 
    of a stone giant. Can be worn around the waist as a belt.

    advanced spell eruption.

    10% chance of spawning on corpse.

    Provides +20 resistance to earth and poison.

runed dwarven fullplate (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/armour/theiwar_fullplate.c)

    Creator : Arman

    This is a suit of beautifully crafted fullplate, made from rare 
    blue ore referred to as 'star-metal' by ancient alchemists - a metal 
    of extraordinary strength and hardness. Dwarven runes have been carved 
    over the armour that pulse with a dark energy.

    This is a magical fullplate that is occasionally worn by the dark dwarf 
    chieftain in the Tharkadan mountain range caverns, 
    /d/Krynn/tharkadan/living/theiwar_chieftain. It provides excellent magical 
    protection, however can only be worn by the smaller races. Those smaller 
    races that aren't dwarves get an AC penalty as it doesn't quite fit them 
    perfectly. Being fullplate, it is quite heavy - weighing around 30 
    kilograms. set_likely_cond has also been set from 3 to 2, reducing the 
    chance somewhat of it wearing down.

    Clone unique value of 10.

    Creator : Arman

    This is a dwarven shield reinforced with bands of the rare material 
    referred to by ancient alchemists as 'star metal' - a blue ore of  
    extraordinary strength and hardness. In the hands of a dwarf or  
    similar sized race this shield provides the protection of a tower 
    shield.

    This is a magical dwarven shield that is occasionally worn by the 
    dark dwarf chieftain in the Tharkadan mountain range caverns, 
    /d/Krynn/tharkadan/living/theiwar_chieftain. It provides excellent 
    protection as a tower shield for the smaller races. set_likely_cond 
    has also been set from 3 to 2, reducing the chance somewhat of it 
    wearing down.

bracers of the umber hulk (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/armour/umberhulk_bracers.c)

    Creator : Arman

    This is a pair of bracers made from the carapace of an umber hulk.
    Incredibly tough, and further enchanted by dark savant enchantments,
    it provides incredible protection to the arms.

    Further, it allows the wearer to call on one of the innate powers of
    an umber hulk - tremor sense - 3 times.
    /d/Krynn/tharkadan/spells/tremorsense.c

    This armour may be worn by the dark dwarf savant lord
    /d/Krynn/tharkadan/living/theiwar_magi.c, and is a very tough fight
    to obtain.

runed ironwood staff (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/weapon/magic_ironwood_staff.c) 

    Creator : Arman

    This staff was created long before the Catacylsm by a black-robed 
    Wizard of High Sorcery battlemage. Loving the thrill of hand-to-hand 
    combat, he enchanted this staff to draw on the holders magecraft and 
    their skill with the element of wind to empower the staff to be quick 
    in the hands, but powerful enough to fell a warhorse in a hit.

    This weapon gets a bonus to hit/pen depending on the holders SPELLCRAFT 
    and ELEMENT_AIR skills, wielded by /d/Krynn/tharkadan/living/ogre_magi.c 
    The staff is also very light.

OBJECTS
=======

serpentine figurine (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/polymorph_figurine)

    Creator : Arman

    This curious serpent figurine made of quartz is a figurine of transformation.
    Under certain conditions, the figurine will release icy vapours from its maw
    which can be inhaled by the holder. Those vapours transform the holder into
    a white dragon hatchling. The polymorphed player then flies up into the sky
    and wings his/her way over the Tharkadan mountain range and into the vale
    overlooked by an ancient volcano. Shortly after landing the player reverts
    to normal form.

    The main purpose of this magic item is to allow players to access the vale
    when the pass is blocked by winter snows.

    Conditions of use:
           * be in an outdoor room in the Tharkadan mountain range directory 
             (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/room/*)
           * it is winter in Krynn.
           * the player is holding the figurine when activating it.

    The item makes use of the shapeshift.c base spell, which has been customised
    at /d/Krynn/tharkadan/spells/polymorph_self.c

    The hatchling form the player turns into is at:
    /d/Krynn/race/shapeshift/thark_polymorph_self_hatchling.c

    Multiple figurines in the same player/room result in them merging into one.

pale wand (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/light_wand.c)

    Creator : Arman & Carnak

    A magical wand that, when held and waved, activates a light spell - 
    (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/spells/wand_light_spell.c) that clones the SOHM light 
    spell object (/d/Krynn/guilds/sohm/spells/objs/light_obj.c). This provides
    a 15 minute light source with a light level ranging from 1 to 5 depending
    on the spell query_spell_effect_power().

    While active the light drains mana as it would a standard spell would. Upon
    releasing the wand the light the light source dissipates.

    The wand has a 1/4 chance of spawning in the cocoon corpse dropped by 
    the giant spider (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/living/giant_spider.c) in the 
    Tharkanan mountain range caverns (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/cocoon_corpse.c),
    and in the magical strongbox in the troll caves 
    (~tharkadan/room/troll_cave/troll_caves7).

magical strongbox (/d/Krynn/tharkadan/obj/magical_strongbox.c)

    Creator : Arman

    A standard container that can only be unlocked by reciting an incantation,
    the words of which are revealed through any identify spell on the strongbox.
    SS_SPELLCRAFT of 40 and SS_FORMS_ABJURATION of 20 is required to adequately
    recite the incantation properly.

    It cannot be re-locked after opening.

    The strongbox can be found in a pile of skeletal remains one can search 
    after defeating the two-headed troll boss in the trolls caves. 
    (~tharkadan/room/troll_cave/troll_caves7).

    The strongbox in itself has a high monetary value, with OBJ_I_VALUE set at 
    12000. This is largely due to it being the only item drop in the entire 
    cave, and to reach it one needs to defeat 8 standard trolls and the 
    two-headed boss troll.
    (~tharkadan/living/cave_troll.c, 
     ~tharkadan/living/two_headed_cave_troll.c).

    The strongbox contains a multi-hued disk, which is required to complete 
    the WoHS quest to obtain the advanced spell protection from magic.
