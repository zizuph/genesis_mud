Krynnish heritage
In the public part of the library can be found materials of different <A HREF="/d/Krynn/krynn_races.txt">Races in Krynn</A>. To find your roots, you need to study all of the relevant material and find the region you originate from, and find a lastname suitable for your standard.

Books describing a Family or a Tribe, or sometimes describing the people coming from an area will contain three items at the end which you need to affiliate yourself with that Family/Tribe or Region.

It is possible to select one of the family names or one of the region names as your lastname. Or, you can even choose a family name appended by a region name.

If you have found a family/tribe/region that you consider yourself a member of, you can affiliate yourself with it.
