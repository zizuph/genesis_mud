The world of Dragonlance
Krynn is a domain inspired by the works of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, specifically the Dragonlance Chronicles:

<B>Dragons of Autumn Twilight
Dragons of Winter Night
Dragons of Spring Dawning</B>

You will find yourself wandering Krynn within the timeframe of the War of the Lance, so may find yourself face to face with the black dragon Onyx of Xak Tsaroth, the fearsome Dragon Highlord Verminaard, or even the beautiful Tika Waylan at the Inn of the Last Home!
