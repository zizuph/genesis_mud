Characters
When travelling through the lands of Krynn you will come across a wide range of unique characters whom you may take up as allies and aid them in their quests or take them on as enemies to their cause. A few are listed here:

<B>Gunthar Uth Wistan, Knight of the Crown</B>
Gunthar is an accomplished warrior and tactician, the knight who took responsibility for the Knights of Solamnia during their darkest hours after the Cataclysm. While no longer Grand Master of the Knighthood, he is still a respected leader amongst the knightly orders. While Gunthar's castle is based on the isle of Sancrist, he is currently based in Vingaard Keep where he partakes in the squiring of new knights, and seeks out adventurers to help him in his many quests.

<B>Lord Verminaard, Dragon Highlord</B>
A ruthless priest of the Queen of Darkness, this Dragon Highlord lives for power, blood, and destruction. Given the task of the conquest of the southern lands of Krynn and the destruction of the elves of Qualinesti, Verminaard drives towards this goal with a fanatical focus. He is a man with no conscience or shred of mercy, and lives for the destruction of all that is good... which leads to his own true weakness, fear of the return of the Gods of Good. He actively seeks adventurers of a dark heart to recover relics of these Gods and make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands.
Verminaard can be found in the fortress of Pax Tharkas between the forest kingdom of Qualinesti and the dwarven gates of Thorbardin to the south.
