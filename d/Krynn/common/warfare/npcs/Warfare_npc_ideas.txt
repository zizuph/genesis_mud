Some ideas for the recoding of npcs for each army and warfare zone.
- Arman, December 2017


PRINCIPLES FOR WARFARE NPCS:
10 warfare zones, split equally with a focus on ~hero mortal level
and ~legend mortal level.

The four main warfare occupational guilds (knights, RDA, BDA, Free people (Neidar)
start a Krynn war with the occupation of one legendary zone each. The remaining
legend zone starts with the White Dragonarmy.

Of the five hero mortal level zones, four start in the control of the
Free People, with the fifth (Throtyl) in the command of the Green Dragonarmy.

Npcs don't wander or hunt!  

Npcs spawn in reasonable numbers across the map.

Hero warfare areas have a chance of spawning masterwork items.

Legendary warfare areas have a chance of spawning magical items, plus
npcs drop tokens that can be traded in to upgrade/purchase prestige items.

Masterwork armours mitigate npc special attack damage with full set mitigating
~75%?  Masterwork armours can be light [leathers] / medium [scale] / heavy [plate]
and can be either gathered as drops from officer npcs or purchased from Palanthas,
Sanction, or Kalaman using tokens/participation points and coin, or crafted.

Masterwork weapons are equipment that can be 'leveled up' through participation,
gathering of crafting resources, and trading warfare tokens to local warfare smiths 
to upgrade.

Unique draconian warfare npcs:

For the warfare areas, we will recode the draconian base and modify
their stats, descriptions, and specials to suit the warfare system.

Hero level draconians would get the descriptions, regardless of draconian
type, of:
<scarred [rising hero] / experienced [hero] / veteran [titan] >

Legend level draconians would get the descriptions of:
< fearsome [champion] / deadly [legend] / elite [myth] > 


                      ---<<@   DRAGONARMIES   @>>---
The dragonarmies have very solid ranks of foot soldiers, supplemented by the dangerous
draconians. However the primary strength of their armies is the support provided by
their dragons.

                      ---<<@   KNIGHTS   @>>---

<experienced/veteran> Solamnian outrider [light armour mounted]


                      ---<<@   THE FREE PEOPLE   @>>---
The free people have a diversity of warriors and defenders across Krynn, depending
on the warfare zone. They are all neutrally aligned, with no penalty for the knights
or dragonarmies to dislodge them:
