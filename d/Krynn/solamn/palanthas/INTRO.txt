/* Welcome to my Palanthas ideas folder, a folder I
created to share my ideas about upgrading Palanthas.
My goal would be to change Palanthas from a passing
through point in the Dragonlance realms to a point of
interest by increasing it to a medium size with a
simple street layout system for easy navigation,
adding quest driven shops and services, guild specific
services, and double solution quests for good and evil.

   I've broken the city down into sections and invite
anyone with an idea of anything they'd like to see in
Palanthas to add their ideas wherever they see fit
within the folders I've created for each section.

   Of course this is all just a proposition and hasn't
been approved by our Liege, but it's all for fun so
add what you will.

Thanks!  -Mortis, June.08 2005 */
