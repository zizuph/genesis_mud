1. What the Spell of Transformation is and what it is used for.

The Spell of Transformation is a spell that will reconstruct the target's
mind and body over time. In layman terms, it means that you can change 
the focus of your stats without dying. For example, if you have focused
mainly on physical stats for a long while, and instead would prefer to
have a stronger mind (but weaker body), it will help you achieve that. 
And it's painless - almost.

2. What you need to know before you undergo mind and body reconstruction.

Before you decide to undergo this procedure, it is important that you 
understand the different stat-reconstruction options you have.

The thaumaturgist will ask you how much emphasis you wish to have on each
of your six stats. You can choose 'normal', 'slightly stronger', 
'somewhat stronger', 'stronger' and 'much stronger'.

Please note that the values are relative, so every high emphasis will 
reduce the impact of the other focuses. In other words, six 'much 
stronger' choices will have the same end result as six 'normal' choices.

You can experiment with these values as you please and watch the effects
unfold. However, there are three important limitations you should be 
aware of:

First of all, just like when deciding which stats to focus on in 
adventurer guilds, the spell will NOT work if you try to focus
all your experience on only one stat. 

Secondly, it's important to know that the Spell of Transformation will NOT
be able to transform your mind and body more than what is otherwise
possible. The maximum possible for a stat can be achieved by primarly 
focusing on that stat from birth, while the lowest possible value is 
achieved by never focusing on a stat during your lifetime. The
spell can never transform your body beyond/below these maximums and 
minimums.

Finally, it should be noted that your racial benefits/drawbacks will of 
course still affect your stats during, and after, the transformation.

3. What to expect during the reconstruction process.

Once the spell has been cast, your body will start to slowly transform.
This process, however, takes time, and the bigger the transformation,
the longer it will take. The transformation will most likely take days to
weeks, but it does not matter if you are awake in the realms or not.

During the process, you will be able to estimate how far you are from
a full transformation by examing your <stats>.

5. Questions and answers.

Q: Can I safely undergo this procedure even if I am currently recovering 
from a recent death?

A: Yes.

Q: What happens if I change my stat focus at an adventurer guild during
the transformation?

A: The transformation will change both new and old experience, up
until you have reached your desired setting.  Meditation will affect your
experience as you get it, and then the transformation will readjust
it.

Q: What if I die during the transformation process?

A: The transformation will continue post-death, up until you have
reached the focuses you desired.

Q: Will gaining a lot of experience (of any kind) have a negative 
effect on the transformation process?

A: Anything you gain or lose during the transformation process
will also be transformed.  You may want to change your meditation
preferences to more closely match your transformation preferences,
or else the transformation may take longer.

Q: I have changed my mind, can I abort the process?

A: No, once the spell is cast you must wait it out.

Q: I am not happy with my transformation, what do I do?

A: You may find that it is somewhat difficult to anticipate exactly how
your mind and body will turn out when the transformation is complete. 
The good news is that if things did not work out exactly as you wanted,
you can simply try again. As long as you can pay the fee, you can 
transform your body as many times as you want, however, you must
always wait for the current transformation to complete until you can
try again.

Q: Will this affect my progress towards become a myth?

A: You may see changes either towards, or away, from your progress
on your mortal rank.  This does not mean you have gained or lost
any experience.  It is simply a side effect of how much your smaller
stats are also helping to boost your title.

Q: I am reading this leaflet for an ogre, and they are wondering if
ogres also can undergo this procedure.

A: Please tell your ogre friend that they too can undergo the procedure, 
but the effects will be less noticeable for them.  However, if they stop 
being an ogre and return to their old body, the effects of their 
transformation will of course become much more noticeable.
