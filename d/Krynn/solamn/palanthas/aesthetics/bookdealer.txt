/* The rare book dealer's contains stories, books from
other lands, rare books from here.  Some are very old,
some damaged and impossible to read all of (perhaps a
quest to repair some pages?), perhaps a quest from the
great library to acquire books here, but the dealer
could also have his own tasks.
