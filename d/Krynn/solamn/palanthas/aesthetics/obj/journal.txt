The battered journal has had most of its pages hurriedly torn out,
with only a quickly scrawled note left to be read:

           ====================- -==================== 

    Master Zeb,

    I pray this message reaches you well, and your unexplained
    absence was not due to an unfortunate incident. However I
    bare you bad news, as your absence was well noted by our 
    ruthless competitors, and they were emboldened to dastardly
    actions against us.

    The Scroll Trade Guilde have been by far the worst thorn
    in our side. Thefts from the store became alarming, to the
    point where us apprentices slept between the bookshelves to
    protect the rare tomes. Anonymous threats to our wellbeing
    became common place, however most disturbing were the rumours
    spread within the Order of Aesthetics and beyond into the 
    Great Library itself! I fear their slander was to push the
    Palanthas council for sanction against us and the confiscation 
    of our goods!

    Already guardsmen of the Tower of Arms have come and taken
    some of our scrolls they considered 'shady'!

    So, myself and the other apprentices have taken the desperate
    action of hiding some of our most valuable items.

    I've managed to sneak into the backroom of the Palace archives
    and hidden something there. The archives are such a mess, it
    would take a determined searcher to notice it is out of the
    usual.

    Grimresh has taken a coffer of scrolls into the dwarven 
    mountains east of Palanthas and hidden them there with his
    illusions. He returned briefly before returning to his family
    at the gnomish settlement near Solace.

    Melvor took some of our stock by sea to Kalaman. We have not
    heard from him since he left, and rumour from the docks are
    that his ship came to grief just near the city harbour. 

    Against my doubts, Madame Ellire took the Tome of Vincil da
    Jevra. Her plan to safeguard the tome is, in my mind, insane. 
    She is convinced she will be able to find an inaccessible hiding
    place for it within the Shoikan Grove! Ever since she uncovered
    that ancient spell of fear protection, she has been convinced
    it would grant her the ability to bypass the magical protections
    of the grove and enter the Tower of High Sorcery! I fear for her,
    as I have not seen or heard from her since she took the tome.

    So that is the state of things. May our paths cross again in
    this realm!

    Your apprentice,
    Xaaxinar.
