/* An inn affordable by poor students.  Aka the "Scholar's
Squalor".  Can rent a cheap room here.  Also has a den or
reading room for students to discuss issues (board?).

   Contains the Scholar's Club which could grant you the
ability to keep one book in your possession permanently if
you have done the quest for the paper maker/book binder to
create it.  This task could be necessary to submit books
to the libraries.
