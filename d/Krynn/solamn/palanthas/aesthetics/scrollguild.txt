/* The Scroll Trade Guild, makers of paper, parchment,
scrolls, vellum.  They also sell writing utensils.

   In order to purchase direct from them, you will need
to complete a task such as securing a shipment of one
of the paper types in order to unlock that paper type
for sale.  The better material is harder to acquire.
There could be some intrigue between the Scroll Trade
Guild and the Bookbinders Guild as they spy and vie
for the best trade deals between them.
