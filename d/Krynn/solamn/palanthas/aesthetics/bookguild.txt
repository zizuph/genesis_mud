/* Using paper and other materials from the Scroll Trade
Guild, they can bind books.  These books can possibly be
kept by players, but could be stolen.  They would be
required for library submissions.

  Possible tasks involving intrigue with Scroll Trade
Guild, binding material retrieval quests, and acquisitions
of rare materials for covers like lizard skin, leather,
or gold leaf for example.  Materials chosen in making
books determine their appearance (e.g. a lizardskin
bound book of vellum or a vellum lizardskin tome, etc.).
