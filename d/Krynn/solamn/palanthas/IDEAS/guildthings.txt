/* I'd like to offer the opportunity for all domain and
even non-domain guilds to send me suggestions on what
common items we could make available for them that they'd
most like to see and that would help them in their daily
lives.  These wouldn't be powerful artifacts, weapons,
armours, or anything truly magical.  Things like weapon
sheaths or holsters, special packs, tracking powder,
oil kits for armour or weapons that maybe prevent a little
wear, or anything people can suggest that is fun without
giving any real advantage.

   Acquiring these in shops or from vendors would require
unlocking them with a quest first.
