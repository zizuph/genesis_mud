/* An idea for the city could be that it's split into the
good side (temples, government, constabulary, the general
populace, scholars), the neutral side (scholars, tradesmen,
merchants), and the evil side (thieves, underworld, dark
scholars, subversive dragonarmy agents, ~squalor).  Quests
should be variants of good and evil so each side has the
exact same xp available.

   Navarre raised a good point to me:  That Palanthas is
known for being good and I have said I want good, evil,
and neutrality.  To clarify, I don't mean it like there is
a war of good and evil going on there.  But the reality of
any big city is that people of all sorts live there.  95%
of the people may be lawful and good, but there are going to
be criminals, merchants and guilds who could be described as
neutral in their goals, and even a few spies from the dragon
armies in the bad areas for intrigue.  My real goal is to
give players of any alignment or faction a fun place to hang
out a lot.

   A faction score could be implemented to encourage
lawful and peaceful behavior without forcing it.  Good
factioned shops, inns, and services would turn in anyone
wanted by the constabulary rather than serve them thus
encouraging a few people to avoid trouble.

   The score could be influenced by quests (both ways)
and your arrest records and rap sheet.  Knights would
start with a bonus to reflect their prestige in Palanthas.
