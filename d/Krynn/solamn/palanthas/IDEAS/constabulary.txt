/*  Criminal activity in the city can be monitored by
the constabulary.  Their office can contain records on
crimes, suspects, wanted lists, and arrests.  Such records
could be available to those who've done all the good side
of the quests for the city and the constabulary quests as
well as available to Knights of Solamnia.
   Hints of records could be available through the under-
ground rumormills

   The problem for thieves is that thief activity in Palanthas
runs you the risk of being spotted in the act (daytime chances
higher than night, etc.) not just by pcs but by npcs also.
This could get you on the constabulary's suspects list.
Getting caught can get you potentially arrested and given a
criminal record in the constabulary or at least on their
wanted list.  

   There should also be a way to clear your record,
perhaps by way of some good quests, penance tasks, 
public humiliations, and/or time.  Questionings
can potentially change records, also.

   The constabulary can catch you a couple ways.  Once
they are on to you, they should be hard to lose unless
you can get somewhere they can't.  Once they catch you,
they will either ask you to come with them (if you're
just wanted for questioning) or throw you in chains (if
you're wanted for a crime).  An idea after being captured
could be to have suspects thrown in a cell where interrogators
attempt to force a confession from you (confess/deny).
If you are wanted for a bad enough crime, they may try to
beat a confession out of you (automatic dmg from beatings
could be 10% of current health so players think they might
die but never have a real chance).
