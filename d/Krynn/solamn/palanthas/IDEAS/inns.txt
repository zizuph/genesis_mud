/* Some inns will actually rent you a physical room!
You can get a key to the door and a padlocked chest inside.
The only problem is with thieves breaking in.  The problem
for thieves is getting caught.  If they're caught, they're
stripped of their gear, thrown in jail, and given a rap
sheet.

/* The main concern would be people using it as a drop
room instead of their guild's which deprives other guild
members of items.  Maybe a guild could rent a room there
instead and the door to the room could be accessible to
them all.  To avoid players taking items from one guild room
if desired, a tag could be applied so they aren't droppable
in other rooms.
