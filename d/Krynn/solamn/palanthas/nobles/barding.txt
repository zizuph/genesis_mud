/* Man here makes barding for horses which can be
very customizable upon order.  Only works for the
city, the nobles, and the knights but all players
must unlock his services with a quest.

   Brenitt the Barder has two horses he purchased
for breeding.  One was stolen by a thief hiding out
with it in the sewers.  The alternate version of
the quest comes from the thief who wants the evil
player to steal the other horse for him. :)
