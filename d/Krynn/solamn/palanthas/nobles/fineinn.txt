/* Like could be available in the Scholar's Den, the
rooms for rent here could actually last until armageddon.
You could get your own key to the room with a lockable
chest and not only start there, but come and go from it
as you please.  The problem is a sewer access point is
nearby and both the door locks and chests are pickable
(but only by those with amplified thief level skills like
from the lockpicks and even then it's spotty)!

   The problem for thieves is that thief activity in Palanthas
runs you the risk of being spotted in the act (daytime chances
higher than night, etc.) not just by pcs but by npcs also.
This could get you on the constabulary's suspects list.
Getting caught can get you potentially arrested and given a
criminal record in the constabulary or at least on their
wanted list.  See the ~/palanthas/IDEAS dir for more on the
constabulary.
