/* Any horse can be stabled here and retrieved up until
armageddon.  The Solamnian Livery is large and well
taken care of.  It is run by Sir Engen of Vingaard, a
retired knight who lost his left leg below the knee to
a hobgoblin in the green dragonarmy.  His family lives
with him and helps run the livery.

   Sir Engen is still a tough knight and stays lightly
armed.  He wears a plated boot and greave over his
missing appendage.  It's hooked and harnessed to his
upper leg armour and provides fair support.  Tasking
for Engen can increase faction.

   The livery is an active place during the day and
there is a night watchman so thieves run a high risk
of exposure if they attempt to break in and attempt
to rob Engen.  Stealing a horse is nearly impossible
to do without exposure and is aharshly punished crime.
