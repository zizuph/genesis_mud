|                                                            |
|                                                            |
|   Palanthas was given a robust base to be a great city     |
| many years ago, but it was never completed or given some   |
| of the useful things a truly great city has. The following |
| updates and additions have been introduced to begin to     |
| rectify that:                                              |
|                                                            |
| * NPCs do not spam you with text when attacked. If you see |
|   any left that do, let me know.                           |
|                                                            |
| * The Adventurer's Guild opened.                           |
|                                                            |
| * Issues with some of the weaponry were addressed.         |
|                                                            |
| * The Mer-Cantile's Cafe was made a no-attack safe room    |
|   by player request for the purpose of guild negotation.   |
|                                                            |
| * Disposal bins were added for city cleanliness.           |
|                                                            |
| * The Tower of Arms opened.                                |
|                                                            |
|   Please let me know right away if you see any issues via  |
| commune if I'm on, otherwise both mail and <bug>. Don't    |
| forget that there are extra ways to explore in Palanthas:  |
| <smell> and <alley> (also <alley south> or <alley s>, etc.)|
| Without using those, you will inevitably miss a few things |
| that can otherwise only be found with your nose or by      |
| using the alley system.                                    |
|                                                            |
|                                                            |
|                                With thanks to the  wizard  |
|                                community that aided me in  |
|                                making this possible,       |
|                                                            |
|                                      Mortis of Palanthas   |
|                                                            |
