|   The gods have left us, they say.  It was not so many centuries | 
| ago that they brought  fiery ruin upon the earth, but humans are |
| a race  swift to  forget.  There is  one  however  who  sees and |

|                                                                  | 
|   Dawn left  red  tendrils of cloud streaking behind  as it fled |
| before the sun yet to rise above the mountains east of the city. |
| The early morne traveller received only casual scrutiny from the |
| Solamnian  sentries  as  he approached  the city gates  from the | 
| southeastern mountain road.  Weathered  and  tan,  the visitor's |
| dark brown  eyes  shone  brightly  in the pale, red-hued morning |
| light  with a vigor  belying  his youth.  A cool breeze  blowing |
| south off the  bay of Branchala  carried with it inviting smells | 
| of  coffee and breakfast  as it tousled the  traveller's  neatly |
| cut long brown hair  blowing  it from his eyes and off his neck. |
| With no more than his shoulder pack and birchwood walking staff, |
| he received  a  nod from  the sentries  as  he  walked past at a | 
| hasteless, measured pace.                                        |
|                                                                  |

|  CHAPTER 1                                                       |
|                                                                  | 
|   Clearing his throat, the wiry, shaggy haired, young  aesthetic |
| repeated, "Teona.  Your biscuits and morne brew?"                |
|                                                                  | 
|   "Oh!" cried the woman looking up  so suddenly from  the great, |
| brownish-red volume  open before her  that her spectacles tilted |
| to the side off her nose, "I'm so sorry, ummm," Pausing to right | 
| her lenses she sat up hastily  bumping the table  and inviting a |
| wave of frowns and annoyed glares  from the aesthetics and other |
| patrons in the library.                                          |
|                                                                  | 
|   "No, don't get up.  Here,"  The wiry, young man set down a cup |
| of coffee  by  the woman's volume and a pair of thin biscuits on |
| a napkin beside that.  "But really, Teona.  If you're  going  to | 
| join us for  the morne's reading, you should try to put at least |
| some effort into remembering to show,"  Seeing no recognition in |
| the woman's eyes, he continued, "The Dawnbringer?"               | 
|                                                                  |
|   "The Dawn... oh, yes, your poem for the..."  Flushing red, the |
| woman placed  her fingers over  her  frowning lips.  In her mid- | 
| thirties the woman  wore a simple, maroon aesthetic robe down to |
| her ankles, undone at the neck, and cinched about her thin waist |
| with  a  precisely knotted  strip of maroon cloth  revealing her |
| slight build.  "I did want to hear it, Dai.  I just..." Trailing | 
| off in silence as  the young aesthetic  headed for the archives, |
| Teona twirled a stray lock of  light brown hair  from  the tight |
| bun atop her head.                                               |
|                                                                  | 
|   "Forget it, Te,"  Dai,  his  eyes  low and weary  despite  the |
| early  hour of the new day, turned saying, "Just try to remember |
| tomorrow."                                                       | 
|                                                                  |
|   Staring at the floor after him, Teona took a small bite of one |
| of the biscuits  hardly  noticing their hint of cinnamon  or the |
| fact they were still warm.                                       | 
|                                                                  |
|  CHAPTER 2                                                       |
|                                                                  |
|   "You play onjat like your milk maid dainty Kitty," said the 
| young page, his silver-trimmed white tunic slung off his chest
| over his shoulder as he pushed aside the boys to either side with
| a smirk and scooped up the dice from the corner.                 
|                                                                  | 
|   "It's Kietia, Mietri," retorted  the older page  spitting  out |
| the younger's name  like a sick tasting bug  had just flown into |
| his mouth.  He was soon to reach his eighteenth birthday and the |
| end of his prerequisite service  and smugly cocky. "And I've got |
| a bloodsea amethyst says you eat your counter the hard way."     |
|
|   "Done," replied Mietri in an instant.  The fifteen year old
| page never passed on odds like that when the payoff was as good 
| as his, and he'd played enough onjat in the alleys and under
| city to know that it soon would be.  Brushing his short, brown
| locks out of his eyes, he let fall the pair of onjat dice he'd
| purchased in the below from his sleeve into his palm and, 
| raising his hand to shake, dropped the legitimate dice out of
| sight down his sleeve barely containing his anxious thrill at
| the switch as he smiled thin-lipped and tight.  "Guidance,
| Paladine," he threw out with a smirk of irony as he tossed the 
| weighted dice, practically guaranteed to roll a seven, into the
| corner amidst the intensely fixed stares of the half dozen pages |
| around him.  His heart thumped, his stomach aflutter with the
| surge of adrenaline brought on by thrill and fear like a knight 
| waiting for a brigand's lunge and the opportunity to join steel
| with jugular as the dice clattered against the floor, themselves,
| and the wall before bouncing back spinning and landing with a
| wobbly jerk...  snake eyes.  The young page's stomach dropped as 
| if burdened by lead balls, and a cold sweat broke across his
| brow.
|                                                                  |
|   "Paladine be praised," grinned the old page, titters of 
| laughter escaping his peeled back lips exposing his large upper
| teeth and gums as he bent to one knee scooping up the pile of
| silver and gold that was all Mietri had left.
|                                                                  | 
|   Trembling in his hands, his heart beat fast unable to keep its
| rhythm as the adrenaline faded leaving his gut sick and hollow
| like a rotting tree stump, Mietri rose as steadily as he could,
| half nodding under the derisive stares of the victorious, and 
| wheeled about.  There before him, standing as if he hadn't moved
| since the page house was built, was a man in plaincut, beige
| travelling attire, a satchel over his shoulder and pale staff in |
| hand.  The two locked eyes, Mietri almost stumbling back at the 
| shock of an adult in the page house... and locked no less!  The 
| visitor seemed to break a half smile with his eyes giving Mietri
| the feeling he was completely transparent to him.
|
|   "Who by the Oath is that?" exclaimed the older page as the 
| others fell over themselves trying feebly to distance themselves
| from the abhorrent debauchery of the corner.  "And," the page's
| brow furrowed as the realization that the only unlocked door to
| the room was the back door leading out to the forbidden woods 
| surrounding the rear of the palace hit him, "How did you get in
| here?"
|                                                                  | 
|   "Mietridate?" asked the visitor, his gaze unbroken.  A flurry
| of pointing hands confirmed what the man already appeared to
| know.
|                                                                  | 
|   "It's Mietri," the young page managed to get out as he pulled
| hard the reins on his galloping pulse and swung his tunic off
| his shoulder and into place smoothing it with his hands.
|                                                                  | 
|   "I have a job for you."  The visitor opened his palm revealing
| a platinum coin.  A crease appeared at the corner of his mouth
| as he allowed the young page to swipe the coin from his hand
| before taking him by the bicep out the back door into the woods 
| leaving many mouths agape and minds a racing in the page house.
|                                                                  |
| CHAPTER 3
|                                                                  | 
|   "Papers," he toned without a trace of enthusiasm as one of his
accountants dropped another order report onto the wide mahogany
desk curving around him like the maw of a great turtle slowly
closing in a lethargic attempt to swallow him whole.  Mindless 
stacks and folders and boxes of paper were all he ever saw
since his father the previous lord of the merchant House
Phounas died five months ago.  Jass stuck his quill into its well
and, brushing aside several stacks of warehouse inventory forms, 
buried his forehead in his hands.  Rubbing his already blurring
eyes he exhaled deeply taking stock of his office.  Cabinets
and bookshelves chocked full of accounting records, books, and
reports contrasted with the polished gold lamps, crystal and 
blue opal candle chandelier, handwoven rug, and oil paintings,
some of which were very old.  One painting in particular he
liked to stare at.  His great aunt had supposedly painted the
scene of the Sea Trist on stormy grey seas, a fork of lightning 
behind its mast, and he was fond of the captain on the stern
castle, long hair flowing behind him as he faced the wind with
a determined, unflinching jaw and blue-grey eyes looking up to
the sails as if there were no place he'd rather be.  They were 
the same blue-grey eyes Jass had, the eyes of his ancestors,
and he fancied himself there beside the captain navigating past
the shoals and crags of some exotic port where their cargo from
Palanthas would fetch them both fortune and renown.  "Damn the 
wind and wave and tell Zeboim to dive and flee for the Trist..."
An outburst of stifled giggles alerted the young merchant lord
that his storm plagued voyage of glory across the seas had not
arrived unmolested.  Cheeks flushed, Jass turned his head 
quickly to the door, fastening his thick fur-trimmed blue robe
into place with his belt, as he realized he was not alone.
|                                                                  |
|   "Jass, love," began the freckled, red-haired young lady
beaming her broadest smile.  "Have we passed the pirate straits
yet?"  Turning to her white dressed handmaiden she whispered 
loudly, "I pray our virtue is safe upon this craft."  At which
the girl blushed giggling as she covered her mouth coyly with
one white gloved hand.
|                                                                  |
|   Pursing his lips to one side in an attempt to appear stern
and annoyed, Jass couldn't hide his smile from his wife,
"Sophie, sweet," he growled clasping his hands behind his back 
and stepping towards her, "You know the captain's deck is no
place for a woman especially during a god storm like this."
|                                                                  |
|   "But his chief navigator hasn't been..." Sophie broke off
clearing her throat as she flicked her eyes at her handmaiden
who, nodding in subdued smile, sat herself on a chair in the 
corner straightening her frilly, white dress as her mistress
continued, "...below deck," at which Sophie raised an eyebrow
and tilted her chin up, "all night and now morning finds his
woman uncompanioned.  Besides, you must be hungry," she said 
holding his attention and nodding until his head nodded along
in compliance.  "And I've brought you your favorite, " Sophie's
eyebrows lifted, "...from Sancrist?"  Stepping close, she
popped one of the dried apricot halves hidden in her hand into 
his mouth, the sweet, tangy flavour prickling his tongue and
swiftening his pulse as she knew it would.
|                                                                  |
|   "Mmmph," Jass managed before Sophie was upon him, her
glossy red lips against his.  The blood thumping through his
temples flushed his face drowning out whatever else was said as 
the two embraced neither paying any attention to the blushing
handmaiden watching raptuously from the corner.

CHAPTER 4

  "We weren't always this way.  When we were kids we dreamed
of more.  One day we would join the solamnian armies, fight our
way to the top, maybe one day be generals.  I don't know. 
Sometimes things don't turn out how you expected."

  The old man nodded, his eyes wide and glazed.  A long tuft of
white hair, likely his daytime comb over, sticking up on the
crown of his head fell over to the side.

  A sick thunk interrupted the young man in mid apology leaving
no doubt in his mind what sound bone and brain made when
crushed.  The old man leaned forward, chin touching chest as 
a single stream of blood ran off his head and down his forehead
before he fell over onto his side, the back of his head caved
in and oozing blood.  "Stow it, titmouse," muttered the dark
outline of a man on the other side of the steadily growing 
puddle of blood.

  He stared, jaw hanging as lifeless as the corpse at his feet.
His eyes focused on nothing in particular but came to rest on
the knobby club Meg stuck in his rat eaten leather belt as 
he kneeled over the old man taking care not to step in his
blood.  They'd found it in the east wood years ago as kids,
some blight or unknown disease responsible for the large knots
at its end.  Since then Meg had shaved down one end into a 
handle and wrapped it with tar and scraps of sailcloth, their
first real weapon.  In Meg's face he could still see that
dirty, stocky boy.  He still recognized the rosy cheeks and
protruding double chin through the scruff and scars now covering 
them.

  "Pirone!" grunted Meg trying to keep his voice down.  "The
stones are gone.  You find anything?"

  Blinking several times as if coming out of a trance, Pirone
shook his head, "No, I was talking to the old man the whole
time, I..."  The old man's foot twitched sending a ripple 
across the large puddle of blood in which he lay.  Wincing, he
acknowledged, "He was telling the truth then."

  Circumnavigating the puddle, Meg stepped forward towards
Pirone walking past the open window through which they had
egressed.  Moonlight disturbed countless tiny motes on its 
shifting blue beams as it illuminated the dark tattoo of a
broken merchant's scale on his shoulder left bare by the rough
sewn brown vest he'd made himself.  "And that bloodsac fence
Mitty sold us on a lie." 

  Pirone's face drooped visibly as he pulled the heavy, hemp
rope from his sack.  "The old man probably never had the
stones," he sighed, starting to hook the rope on the window 
sill.

  "No," replied Meg moving for the door, his fist flattened
nose wrinkling back as his eyes narrowed becoming fixed and
determined, "but he has a daughter." 

  Leaving the rope by the sill, Pirone sat down quietly on the
old man's feather bed.  His eyes staring into the now still
puddle of blood cooling in the moonlight until they saw through 
it and blurred into an oddly comforting emptiness.

CHAPTER 5

  The sun rising just? above the trees in the park caught the
top of the fountain's streams in sparkling bands of purple and
silver before they arced back down with tinkling bloops into 
the stone pool below.  The steward had taken him here before.
Several years had passed since then, but he remembered liking
the small scale replica of the Tower of Arms rising from the
pool's center spurting water from its four corners. 

  Mietri rubbed his hands together (for warmth?) more from the
anxiety chilling his veins than the brisk breeze blowing south
off the bay.  Staring at the tower fountain he wondered why all 
these years he'd never returned when the sound of voices coming
from the park entrance to his east rustled him from the
gurgling, rhythmic trance into which the fountain had slowly
been drawing him like the call of fall's frosty ground to the 
drying leaves above with its promise of slumber evermore.
Yawning, the young page mumbled to himself, "Easiest two plats
I'll likely see," as he ran north taking his place in the
birchwood grove. 

  "I was hoping for a reading from the Katra Temptus, Matron
Dyala," came the soft voice from the east as an older woman and
three young ladies approached the fountain.  Following behind, 
two halberd-bearing guards took up positions to either side of
the eastern exit path, their polished suits of chainmail
scintillating in the sun's first rays.

  "Ihh," breathed the older lady shriveling her nose and pursing
her pale, bloodless lips.  For a woman in her forties, Matron
Dyala had remained in admirably slim shape which her tight- 
waisted emerald green dress displayed.  Placing a hand to her
temple, she patted her hair reassuring herself not a filament
was out of place.  Her lush, black strands were pulled back into
a tall bun from which her gently curled tresses fell back down 
to rest about her shoulders where they shone in iridescent hues
in the young dawnlight.  "No such 'noble' perusal this morning,
Lady Micaela," she replied with mild distaste, folding her dress
beneath her as she sat with stiff back upon a smooth, marble 
bench.

  "Perusal?" questioned the tall, brunette girl as she sat on
another marble bench, and folded her arms across her dress.
Resting her chin on her hand, she batted her eyelashes with 
eyes wide.

  "Why, I thought Micaela just looked at the pictures," the
second brunette continued for the first as she tucked her dress
beneath her and sat beside her friend.  The two shared a 
knowing glance as they smiled bright-cheeked at Micaela.

  "If the three of you are finished debasing each other in the
public park," began the matron.

  "There's not a soul to hear," interrupted Micaela her quiet
voice requiring the matron to strain her ears to hear. ?mic desc?

  Closing the thin, gold leaf bound book she had opened and
placing it on her lap, Matron Dyala gazed towards the northern
expanse of the park.  Her ladies-in-waiting did not fail to 
notice her slow exhalation, known to precurse her fits of ire,
as her bosom, bound tightly by the bodice of her emerald green
dress, lowered visibly.  "A lady is never alone," she intoned,
turning back to look at them, her slow rising eyebrow a black 
snake rising from the high grass.  That was enough to close the
ladies' mouths and induce a more somber atmosphere.
ch?
  Crouched behind a hedge of sculpted holly bushes within
earshot of the ladies, Mietri heard the matron's lesson begin, 
his signal to act.  "Time to get paid," he whispered under his
breath as he stood and adjusted his white page's tunic smoothing
it out so he appeared 'pristine and professional' as the adjunct
minister of pages was tediously fond of saying.  "Lord Baul!" 
he shouted running south towards the fountain and its gathered
ladies.  "I've found it!"  On cue he tripped passing the
fountain and stumbled to rise, his hand holding high the ring
the lord had given him to find.  Standing, the rays of the sun 
caught the ruby and diamond set atop the ring surprising even
Mietri as a ruby-tinted rainbow of light illuminated the park
reflecting in prismatic hues off the glistening, wet marble of
the fountain's tower, the polished chainmail of the guardsmen, 
and the glassy eyes of every breathless stare.

  Mietri stumbled forward a step as he lowered the ring ending
its transfixing display.  To his recollection the ring hadn't
impressed him that deeply when the lord gave it to him he 
thought to himself.  As the ring passed before his eyes, his
vision blurred past it to focus on Lord Baul standing directly
in front of him.  The young page noticed his tunic had become
uncomfortably warm as he backed away.  The ring twisted in his 
sweaty hand, and his heart almost skipped a beat as the pair
of armored guards rushed to stand between the page and his lord
and the ladies at the fountain.  Their grey tunics bore the
wolfhound and yellow stripe from shoulder to waist easily 
recognizable as belonging to noble house Tallon.

  Setting her lesson book on the bench, Matron Dyala stood with
lifted chin and pushed between the guards dismissing them to
their post with a flutter of her hand.  "A..."  Not a syllable 
into her polished salutation, she was interrupted by the newly
arrived noble.

  "Ring," he spoke without so much as a glance at the matron.

  "Yes, Baron... err uhh, Lord Baul," stammered his page as the
noble swiped the ring from his hand.

  The noble frowned, the wrinkles of his sun browned and wind
blown face creasing then smoothing back with healthy vigor.  His
eyes were a deep, dark brown like fine loam from the richest 
farms of rainy Altigoth at night.  Long, neatly cut brown hair
hung just above his shoulders.  "Well bred and well travelled,"
thought the matron, "a fair trade for his apparent tendency for
outdoor pursuits and likely associations with lower classes." 
Folding her hands at her waist to avoid any fidgeting that would
betray her years of meticulous grooming, she appraised him head
to toe.  The cut of his matching, beige travelling clothes,
though simple, possessed an elegance of foreign tailoring. 
"Not too old but neither too young.  Yes," she machinated, "a
fine catch for any maiden of high birth.  And did the page say
baron?"

  "Mietridate," the noble addressed the page, "we've tarried
long enough.  See to my accomodations at the Greystone Inn."

  Taking a step forward and curtseying, the matron cleared her
throat, "My apologies to you, my lord."  A half smile tweaked
the first signs of crow's feet at the matron's eyes as she 
blinked slowly, her long lashes waving alluringly before she
continued, "Allow me the pleasure of your introduction."

  The noble turned his eyes in the matron's direction.  Looking
past her, his eyes surveyed the finely dressed, young ladies.

  "I am Matron Dyala of house Tallon, and these are my wards
the Ladies Sheinas..."

  "I am Lord Baul," he interrupted.  "Though I do not normally
indulge in such pursuits," at which he paused to smile at the
matron's ladies, "you may bring your wares to my suite at the 
Greystone this evening."

  The ladies grinned at each other, loving this new lord's
mistreatment of their draconian chaperone as Matron Dyala's
ordinarily white cheeks turned ten shades of crimson.  "Wa... 
wares?" she cried, "These are the ladies of 'noble' house
Tallon not courtesans for your casual trist!" the matron
proclaimed, hands on her hips and bosom heaving before adding
sharply, "My lord." 

  "Yes, of course, matron," he acknowledged unphased as he
shared a smile with the ladies watching with intense interest.
Nodding his head at the fuming matron he turned locking eyes 
with her, his intense gaze quickening her pulse and unnerving
her in ways she hadn't felt since she was a young lady herself.
"I am Lord Baul.  Good day."  With a measured pivot, he took
the eastern path out of the park and disappeared out of sight 
behind the high hedge leaving the provoked matron in the midst
of her chittering, giggling ladies like a wade fisher stuck on
a shoal in high tide.
