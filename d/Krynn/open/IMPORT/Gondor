NB: Krynn would like to recognize Gondor for its many unique
objects that have added much to Genesis.

Gondorian herbs can be found throughout Krynn, placed by the
herb_master.c found in /d/Krynn/common/herbs. Much care has been
taken to place the herbs in appropriate places, and, Gondor-
restricted herbs are not used.

Much of the herbsearching functionality in Krynn is through
the efforts of Gondor of establishing a useful skill_enhance.c,
a herb_master.c and a herbsearch.c. As well, herb-specific
containers can be found in Krynn, also Gondorian in origin or
inspiration.

Gondorian oil_lamps and oilflasks are sold in:
/d/Krynn/solamn/thief/theiwar/r22.c
