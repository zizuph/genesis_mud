This document details the poison givers and poisons given in Krynn.
The use of this document is for when the updated method of dealing
with poisons comes about. Another small purpose is to detail
the strength and types of poisons in Krynn, so that they can be compared
relatively.

Poison Givers:
--------------
Cleric of Morgion - "/d/Krynn/common/npcs/wand_cl_morgion.c"
	- This npc spreads sickness and plague throughout the realms.
	  He is a cleric of a god of disease, and thus, being in
	  in contact with him can cause disease, or it can occur
	  merely by being in the same room with him. The player
	  must be slightly hurt to get the poison from the shadow
	  he carries.
	  Poison: "/d/Krynn/common/poisons/sickness.c"
	  Poison shadow: "/d/Krynn/common/poisons/sickness_sh.c"


Poisons Given:
--------------
Sickness - "/d/Krynn/common/poisons/sickness.c"
           "/d/Krynn/common/poisons/sickness_sh.c"
	- This poison is a plague-like sickness, that is both 
	  infectious and harming. It has an incubation time,
	  and is carried by both npcs and players, although
	  only players will feel the effects. The player must be
	  at non-maximum hit points to receive the infection.
	- Poison type - "sickness"
	- Poison strength - "30"
	- Cure - none at the moment.
	- NB: This poison uses Krynn bits 1,7 and 1,8 to allow
     the infected player to only get it a random number of times
     before becoming immune.
