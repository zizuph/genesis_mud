Hi there, since Merrygrin asked me I have moved copies of Krynnian
monster and creature files here. If you want you can inherit them
instead of /std/monster.c or /std/creature.c .

If you do this, your monster will be able to perform the command emote.
So you could use the instruction: add_act("emote smiles at you"); for instance.

When your monster kills another player, he will be get a grave on the Krynnian
graveyard.

You can use set_knight_prestige() and query_knight_prestige(). It would then
affect the Solamnian Knights prestige when they killed a monster. You could
set the knight prestige in a small child to -2 (lose 2 steps on the stat) 
or am evil dragon to 2000, add 2000 experience points to the prestige stat
in a Solamnian Knight.

If you only want the players to be affected with prestige you can always
define an own query_restige_knight() function in your monster that returns
an appropriate integer.

More functions will come in the future.

Nick
