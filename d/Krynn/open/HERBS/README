Krynn/Ansalon now has a list of 66 herbs, all of which are currently
implementable. A list of all the effects of the herbs can be found in
/d/Krynn/open/HERBS/KRHERBS, and the herb locations of the Krynn
/herbs can be found in /d/Krynn/open/HERBS/KRherb_locs. I stress it here
and in KRherb_locs, please ensure that the right herb is found in the 
right place. :-)

Any ideas or suggestions for Krynnish herbs are welcome. Please mail
them to me, and I'll check them against the herbfiles of other
domains (at least the lists I have access to) to eliminate any
duplication. Any herbs specifically from any of the books or 
available reference manuals are especially good, and please include
the book title, and page number or reference of event.

Any herbs needed for quests or spells should also go here, so again
contact me. Please keep in mind that this is the database for both Krynn 
and Ansalon herbs.
