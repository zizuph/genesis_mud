This document explains in what sort of ecosystems and communities one can
find the various herbs that have been coded in Krynn for the use of all 
of Genesis. If I find that an herb has been coded in an area that I believe
does not belong in that area, I will complain. Bitterly. ;-) Seriously, 
though, please use the best judgment you can.
