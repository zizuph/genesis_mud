Honourable Aridor of Krynn is a longtime member of the Krynn domain
and former Lord. His pets are the plains of Abanasinia with the
barbarian tribes and to continue work on the Krynn race guild, but
he is working on everything else at the same time, too. (Actually,
he is just idling away, so it might be a while before anything gets
finished.)
