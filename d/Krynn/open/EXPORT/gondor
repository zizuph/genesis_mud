greetings, aridor!

i would like to make gondor's poison sumac behave as krynn's poison ivy
does -- if picked without gloves, it should give itching fits. :-)
would you have any objections to my using krynn's 
/d/Krynn/common/poisons/ivyp for this?  the effects of ivyp seem
quite general, and i think it would be suitable for use with the sumac
too.

if there's some reason it won't work, of course, i can roll my own
but i'd like to avoid duplicating existing code if possible.

thanks!
