THE ONE NOTE PER MORTAL BOARD
=============================

I have made a board where every mortal can have only one note put up
at any time. This may be useful to prevent cluttering of boards with
stupid notes.

The board is in effect in the krynn.c board and you can bet there are
fewer notes now that just waste boardspace.
The filename for this board is:
/d/Krynn/solace/new_village/obj/city_board.c

Please mail me if you are interested in using such a board.
