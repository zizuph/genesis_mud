PRESTIGE 
========

Introduction:
-------------
The Solamnian Knights base their rank on the prestige system. With higher
prestige they come to higher level and can train more in the guild.


Monsters&Creatures:
-------------------
Normal npcs _without_ prestige are not attractive for knights to kill, even
if they are very evil. To make your NPCs valuable for knights (evil ones
only) define the function in your NPC code:

    int
    query_knight_prestige()
    {
         return <prestige>;
    }

If the number is > 0 it adds prestige to the player if he kills the monster
just like the normal experience. If the number is < 0 it removes prestige
directly from the prestige stat.

!!!!A negative number removes MORE than a positive adds!!!!

Here are _guidelines_ for setting the prestige of different NPCs:
- Evil monsters:
    average_stat * average_stat / 10
- Evil creatures (that are not able to think):
    average_stat * average_stat / 40
- Animals (neutral):
    0
- Good creatures (that are not able to think):
    -1
- Good people:
    -1..-4
- Holy people:
    -4..-8
- Quest related people (if you don't want them to be killed by knights :)
    <= -1

Bonuses may be given for special attacks, special circumstances, eg.
a monster leading others (eg. ~20 for a standard damage special,
~400 if the npc belongs to a group and can only be killed last of the
bunch). Npcs which can be considered lawful evil can give a bit more
prestige than the number mentioned above, just add something between
20..100 to the value (depending on size, etc).

Quests:
-------
You may also give or remove prestige from a knight for completing a
quest! Use
   if (player->query_guild_member("Solamnian Knights"))
     player->change_prestige(<prestige>);
for this. The number should be in the same range as for kills,
ie. -8..~2000. I would think a quest that results in the disposal of
an evil monster should give the same amount as killing the monster,
maybe even a bit more.

NOTE: The numbers given here are guidelines! The correct question to
      ask when giving prestige to an npc is: 'What would Paladine
      say if a knight killed this npc.' (As you probably know, Paladine
      is the god 'responsible' for the knights :) If you feel that
      Paladine wouldn't care in the least if a knight killed your
      evil npc, give litte or no prestige :)


If you have any questions for specific problems, please ask me.
Thank you very much for taking the time with the knight prestige,
the guildmasters of the knights, the wizards of Krynn and every
knight player appreciates highly your support.
