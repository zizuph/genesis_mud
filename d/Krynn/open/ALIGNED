Aligned Objects in Krynn
========================
Last modified by:

This document has a twofold purpose. The first is to record
those objects in Krynn which are both holy and sacred, or
defiled and malevolent. The hope of documenting these items
is that other domains will follow suit, and there will be a
time in the future that the OBJ_I_ALIGN prop can be used
within guild and domain code extensively.

The second purpose of this document is to provide a guideline
for the integer values of objects with alignment, both for Krynn
and other domains' use.

Weapons
-------
Wyrmsbane (/d/Krynn/common/weapons/wyrmsbane.c)
	- Alignment of 600, the requirement to wield.

Nightbringer (/d/Krynn/pax/weapon/nightbringer.c)
	- Alignment of -600, the requirement to wield.

Armours
-------
Amulet of Morgion (/d/Krynn/common/armours/wcm_amulet.c)
	- Alignment of -900, same as its bearer, who is a cleric
          of a god of disease and decay.
Objects
-------
Disks of Mishakal (/d/Krynn/common/objects/disks_of_mish.c)
	- Alignment of 1150, it is a holy artifact of a healing god,
          but it is forged by mortal hands (elsewise I'd make it 1200).
