EI: Explore Item (see below)
Group 4 quests (Explore Items, really) are tours which are not "given out" by anyone. The experience is given out when a player first entersthis specific room (or comes in touch with an object, in the future, or even looks at an add_item somewhere). How he/she gets to the room is not important (alone or in a team). With a good number of such rooms/tours, it will be possible to gain experience by being a goodexplorer alone.
