Krynn domain is based on the Dragonlance books, of which the seminal works were
written by Weis and Hickman. Krynn and its brother domain, Ansalon, attempt to
bring this fictional world to life, as accurately as possible. The time period
of the domain is set during the War of the Lance, detailed in the Chronicles
series of books. Krynn is doing maintance mostly and the focus is to finish
the open and planned areas in a way that makes it easy to maintain the domain. 

Krynn wizards are also responsible for maintaining the Ansalon domain.
