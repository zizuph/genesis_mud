Prestigious Knights' Club
=========================

This is a minor guild with no tax. It is located in Palanthas and
offers a scabbard as the club item. The guild is based on total 
playing time within the last 2 weeks (as a member of the club)
of the member and alignment. This means that longer playing
and high alignment result in a higher title.
The club can be found at ~Krynn/solamn/palan/club/club3, where
you can become a supporter, too.
