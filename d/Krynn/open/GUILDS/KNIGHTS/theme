The Knights of Solamnia
=======================

The Knights of Solamnia are an occ/lay fighting guild based on
the Knights of the same title in a series of books by
Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (the Dragonlance series).

The original version of the Knights of Solamnia is the first, and
thus oldest, guild in the LPMud world. It has been modified and
recoded over time into the version it is today.

The guild has the entrance requirements of:
- Human, dwarf, or half-elf race.
- Trustworthy in alignment.
- Acceptance by a Knightly council, a sponsor, and a Conclave member.

The player starts out as a Squire of Solamnia, and through tasks
and the gaining of prestige via combat, can eventually become
a Knight of the Crown. Once becoming a Knight of the Crown, the
player can further advance within the Knights into the Orders of
the Sword and Rose.

Knights are forced to maintain a good alignment, and are also
punished severely for killing good creatures or those that have
a negative prestige set to them.

The Knights have a guildhall, Vingaard Keep, which provides both
Knight only and public facilities for players of all types.

Players who betray the Knights become Knights of the Black Rose and
face severe penalties.

Leaving the guild causes the player to face a death.
