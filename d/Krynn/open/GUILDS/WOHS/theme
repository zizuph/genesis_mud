Wizards of High Sorcery
=======================

Structure
---------
The Wizards of High Sorcery (WoHS) are an occupational mage guild, based on
a similar 'guild' in the Dragonlance series of books by Margaret Weis
and Tracy Hickman. However, they will be treated like three sub-guilds,
ruled by a mortal council (Conclave) of the highest member of each
sub-guild.

Each sub-guild has its own spells and skills. 
The three sub-guilds are divided by a simple quality, alignment.
White-robed Mages are good in alignment, from numerically +400->+1200 align.
Red-robed Mages are neutral in alignment, from numerically -400->+400 align.
Black-robed Mages are evil in alignment, from numerically -400->-1200 align. 

Guildmaster:
------------
The guildmaster of this guild is Rastlin.

** Please note that at the moment, spells are under construction, and are
   being introduced one at a time, so that balance effects and testing can
   occur as each is introduced. **

Joining
-------
* Only humans and elves are allowed to join the guild.
* No layman guilds are accepted, racial guilds will be allowed.
* One has to be 'invited' to the guild, in a manner similar to the way
  it occurs in the DL books...no one can find the guild hall unless they
  have been invited to take the 'Test'.
* A master of the Order must be present for an applicant to join.
* Someone acting as a teacher must be present for an applicant to join.
* The order joined will be dependent on alignment
* The guild-stat will be reset upon joining. 
* One joins as an apprentice mage.

When joining a robe and a spellbook will be given to the applicant.

Expelling and Leaving
---------------------
A player can be expelled/banished from the guild by the conclave members.
If someone is banished, he/she is not able to rejoin the guild. Banishment
by a Conclave member results in a death. Changing race to one that is not
allowed will also lead to expulsion, but not a death.

Leaving the guild will result in:
* Clearing of the guild stat.
* Removal of robe.
* Removal of spellbook.
 
Conclave
--------
The conclave consists of three members, one from each Order. One Conclave
member also acts as the Head of the Orders.
Conclave members have the ability to:
* Punish/reward members in their own Order.
* Punish/reward apprentices.
The Head of the Order has the further ability to:
* Punish the other members of the Conclave.

Robe
----
The robe of the mages is the only armour they are able to wear, other than
necklaces and ring, as well as herb-picking gloves. The robe has a wearable 
hood which makes the player unknown to people who have them remembered, and 
changes the adjective description of the person. All players viewing a 
Mage hooding themselves will know who it is (if they have been introed or 
remembered.) All players introduced to (after wearing the hood) will also 
know and recognize the Mage. It is also possible for other players to 
remove the hood from the Mage.

Apprentice vs. Full-fledged Mage
--------------------------------
Upon joining the guild, one starts as an apprentice Mage. To advance to a
full-fledged Mage with a full range of abilities and skills, an apprentice
needs to pass the Test. The Test is an adventure that the teacher and
Head of the Order create. When the apprentice is worthy of Mage status
as decided by both the teacher and Head of the Order, he/she will be
granted further status and spells.

An apprentice is restricted to the first eight levels of the guild,
out of a total of 29 levels (not including Conclave level). The apprentice
mages are restricted to polearm and knife weapons.
