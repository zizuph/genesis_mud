The Templar Knights of Takhisis

Evil Layman guild

Fighter

The Templar Knights of Takhisis are a band of warriors loyal
to the Dark Queen of Krynn and Her Priesthood.  Anyone
except Kender may join, if their heart is black enough.
Although any may become Warriors of Takhisis, only those
selected by the Lord Templar, his Officers, or the Priesthood
of Takhisis may receive the honour of being made a 
Templar Knight - and enjoy the special respect and
recognition that comes with it.  

The abilities learned by Templars are combat oriented,
and focus on dealing and avoiding melee damage in combat.
