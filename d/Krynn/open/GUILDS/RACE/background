The Krynn Race Guild
--------------------

This is a big project to make all raceguilds that are possible (well,
almost all :) in Krynn in one huge guild.

Basis for the guild is the Great Library in Palanthas. Here, in a
backroom, are all the information about the races, tribes and regions
of Krynn available. People can inform themselves about each type,
and it is possible for each race (except gnomes and hobbits currently)
to affiliate themselves with a certain region, family, or tribe.

The database available is huge! and there should be something for
everyone :) Each race has it's own emotes, and each tribe/family will
have their own emotes, too!

One feature of the guild is an additional half-elf section, which both
humans and elves can join. Half-elves of course have their own set of
emotes, plus get their race name changed to half-elf wherever possible.

The guild does not charge any tax right now, and will not offer skills.
There is also no real guild room (except this room in the library).

It is intended to have training rooms and startrooms in each area/region,
where the people actually would live. This is far in the future, since
all of Krynn would have to be coded first. In this case, a minimal tax
of 1 or 2% could be charged for training facilities etc.
