The Inventor Guild
==================

Being a the gnomes racial guild, we try to give the player the feeling of
being a gnome. So the guild mainly offers emotes, some mudlib skills and 
the special skill build.

Using build the player can 'analyze' magical objects. He takes them apart
and hopefully finds something out. Maximum level of identifying is 40%.
The object is obviously lost in the progress.

The life of gnomes is devoted to inventing, constructing and building.
So advancement inside the guild is dependent on submission of ideas for
'modules', small machines, allowing specific non-combat actions or simply
emotes,  which the able member can build and then use.
