The Inventor's Guild of Krynn
=============================

The Inventor's Guild of Krynn is a race guild for the oft-forgotten
race, gnomes. The theme of the guild is based on what gnomes do
best: invent. They are able to build certain gizmos and gadgets
to get some minor effects, mostly for show.

The gnome guild is currently placed near Solace, however there should
be plans in the future to make it an actual Mount Nevermind
on Sancrist Isle.
