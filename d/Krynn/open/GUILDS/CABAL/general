The Cabal of Hiddukel
---------------------

The Cabal is a layman thief guild taking the direction of burglary.
The guild object is a key ring that serves the purpose of  1)
being itself the key into the guild and  2) to keep a collection
of keys, which will stay with the player (Autoloading).

The keys contained in the keyring must be ordinary keys (inherit
/std/key) and they may NOT have the "_key_i_no_keyring" property
added. This is the standard way to prevent a key from being added
to the keyring.

The Cabal is dedicated to Hiddukel, the Krynn god of corrupt wealth.
The symbol of Hiddukel is a broken balance that every member gets
tattooed on his/her neck. Any item worn on the neck will reduce the
chance that the tattoo is detected.

At least 10% of every Thief's illegal income must be sacrificed to
Hiddukel (see the 'sacrifice' doc).

The Cabal is located beyond the former treasury of the dwarves of the
Theiwar clan of the Vingaard mountains. Gaining access into the
treasury also makes up the entrance quest for the guild.

Leaving the guild will call the wrath of Hiddukel upon you and if he
is in a bad mood anything can happen...
Most or all of the skills learned will be taken away and usually you
will die, too.

The guild rooms comprise a sleeping room (start location) with a list
of the thieves currently playing, a chapel dedicated to Hiddukel, a
fence where stolen goods can be fenced for a decent price. Also avail-
able are a training room, a mail room and a common board. A discussion
board is located in the sleeping room.
