The domain of Krynn is modelled after the Dragonlance series of
books written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. It is the
goal of coders of Krynn to be as true to the source material as
possible, while still maintain a playable realm within the
limits of Genesis. Krynn's other goals are to provide
a fantasy atmosphere, both entertaining and exciting, and
a challenge to players of all levels and alignments, while
still remaining true to the standards and goals of Genesis.

Krynn currently has the following areas coded:
The Plains of Solamnia
Vingaard Keep, guild hall of the Knights of Solamnia
The Knights' Spur
Vingaard Mountains.
City of Palanthus.
Town of Solace.
Pax Tharkas.
The Forest of Wayreth.
The Tower of High Sorcery (Wayreth), home of the WoHS.
