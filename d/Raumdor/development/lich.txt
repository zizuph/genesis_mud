- Spells trigger unwanted attacks if spell resolves when target changed. There
  are functions that sound like they help handle this, but I want to ask Carnak
- Need to restrict movement, taking into account path and temple
- Need to make sure it targets non-Raumdor undead appropriately.
- One of the emotes can "see" people even if they are invis - check for visibility.

- Charges can't be tested right now. Need write access to /common/arm to put the life_amulet
  in there. Had worked previously, should still work now?
