    the top of the object comment block?
   -magical ring that converts damage received into mana damage
    instead of hp damage? [[WORKING ON THIS ANOTHER TIME]]
   -mundane version of each item so the player doesn't know what they
    are going to get as loot until after the lich is killed
	
   
Add movement so that lich can follow/hunt
   What about illusions?
