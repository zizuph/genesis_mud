/d/Raumdor/open/projects/

In this Directory Raumdor wizards should have a
file that vaguely describes what projects they 
are working on. The description should be vague
since all info in this directory is available to
mortals through the tower of domains in Sparkle.

Create files as follows:

<wizards name>.prj
The files with personal info on projects under work.

Raumdor.prj
This will be the domain information file.
This file is the responsibility of the liege.
