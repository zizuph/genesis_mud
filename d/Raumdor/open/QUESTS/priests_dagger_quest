Find the temple in the Forest of Shadows. Must kill the mage guard
at the entrance to open the way. Mage hard, she kick your butt if you are not
good. Once in temple, lots of fun things to see. A priest in there has 
lost a dagger. He wants his dagger back. A search through the dungeons 
will find it in a skeleton under a bench /d/Kalad/common/raum/cdlair1/d05.c
Need light in dungeons. Its hard to find to get into the temple, but once
in, there is no danger.
Undead can enter the temple with no problem.
Once you got the dagger, bring it back to priest and give it to him. He 
tells you how happy he is to be able to start sacrificing people again. 
You get 500xp
