This is a small quest. Player finds the temple entrance lich, urgana. They
ask her about the khiraa, and eventually she will talk about a task that
they may do if they want to enter further into the temple. They must go to
the blood sacrifice room, ~raum/cdlair1/cd12, and search, where they will
find the bloody demon horn, ~raum/cdlair1/obj/horn, and take it to
drakmere, where they will find the bloody skeleton hidden in a manhole,
~raum/npc/bloody_skeleton. They give it the horn, he talks about a symbol
in the flats, and hits at giving blood to it. The player then must find
the symbol room in the flats, ~raum/nflats/nf10. There, they can cut
themselves with the horn, and the blood will go in the mouth, and they
