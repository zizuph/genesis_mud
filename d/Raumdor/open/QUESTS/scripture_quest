This is a quest from the Lord of Drakmere in Raumdor...
   When the player talks with the Lord for a bit, he will get sent on a 
quest. It is important that all the steps be done in order, or it WILL NOT 
WORK!(I made it this way :)) There are proterties, DRAKMERE_QUEST_ONE, 
that are checked and added as the player does the quest.
The quest starts at lord drakmere  :
"/d/Kalad/common/raum/drakmere/keep/ke16"

step 1:
    The player must seek out Penthalus. He is hidden in the mountain pass 
trail("/d/Kalad/common/raum/mtrail/mt11"), but he is hard to find. But If 
they do, the player will find a dial, and must answer a question right If 
they get it wrong(any other but the nameless one) A very mean creature 
comes out (/d/Kalad/common/raum/npc/revenant), and 
attacks them(certain death to almost anyone but very powerful warriors). 
This is the first chance to die.  Then, the player must go through the 
tunnels(/d/Kalad/common/raum/mtrai/secret1-6) where they are faced with 
another riddle. THey must find out what 
room to take and what lever to pull to get to Penthalus. An examination of 
the bones will tell them which room. Then, once they are past that, they 
get into Penthalus' room(/d/Kalad/common/raum/mtrail/secret6) Here, he 
waits for them. If the players ask him 
about the scripture, he will attack them. Penthalus is quite a formidable 
for, and if the player is not well prepared, it could mean death. This is 
the second chance to die. Once he is killed, a search of his room will 
reveal a book on a table.(exa the table then take it), and if the player 
has already talked to Drakmere, an 
examination of the book will reveal a secret torn out page, with clues as 
to where he has hidden the scripture.(it says the scripture is behind the 
waterfal in the forest of shadows)

step 2:
   Once the player has the clues, they will go out back into the Forest of 
Shadow(A very very dangerous place), they will find the 
waterfal,(/d/Kalad/common/raum/wforest/wf42) and a 
secret passage behind it.(/d/Kalad/common/raum/wforest/crypt1) They enter, 
and are faced with a skeletal 
guardian and a huge iron door. The skeleton has the key, and if the player 
fights it, and defeats it, they will not yet get the key ;). The skeleton 
crumbles into bones, but drops the key into the water. If the player then 
follows the river down into the pool where it 
ends(/d/Kalad/common/raum/nforest/nf15) then searches a bit,(drink from 
the pond) they will find a black ghoul who jumps out and attacks. Then, 
after 
defeating it, they will have the key. The player then goes back to the 
crypt and 
unlocks the iron door and enters a long passage. At the end, they will 
find the scripture in a chest, but the chest is trapped. If they do not 
search for traps on the chest(and they need a thief or ranger with this 
skill in order to do it) then they must remove it. Then, they can open it, 
and....the scripture is theirs. Return it to Drakmere for full xp.

Because of the 2 times a player faces certain death, and because of the 
very dangerous nature of the quest, they player will be rewarded an xp sum 
of: 50 000 xp
