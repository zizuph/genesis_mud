|     Drakmere has been the central locality of Raumdor for many years. The  |
| Nobles of Raumdor have chosen Drakmere as a prime spot to invest in a club |
| for gentleman. This was a choice location and it is here that many         |
| gentlemen have come to gather and be with other gentlemen of their stature.|
| But the ladies of these fine noble families needed a place to gather as    |
| well. So a club for them was established in a timely fashion as could be   |
| arranged.                                                                  |
|                                                                            |
|     Many ladies come to discuss many different subjects of interest.       |
| Although there isn't a guest dining available here there is a parlor that  |
| ladies may entertain guests in. This is an intimate ladies club and only   |
| proper ladies may join. Those who are engaged in unwanted behaviors are not|
| allowed to join, such as dancers. No self-respecting lady of quality and   |
| breeding would dare to be a dancer.                                        |
|                                                                            |
|     Some members like to display their charm and sophistication and so they|
| like to wear their pleated charmeuse hat or long silk gloves. Whatever the |
| reason for ladies to come and enjoy the club matters not. The Nobles of    |
| Raumdor are proud to have it available for those who have asked for it.    |
| They also hope that Ladies of genteel birth everywhere will enjoy.         |
