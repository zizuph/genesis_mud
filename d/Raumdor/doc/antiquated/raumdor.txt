--    Raumdor has the recurring theme of Good vs. Evil. With evil      --
-- being a predominant factor or advantage in the domain setting. The  --
-- domain will focus heavily upon evil factions than upon the good,    -- 
-- although there will be plenty of good to balance the evil. There    --
-- will be the constant threat of evil that lingers or constant doom   --
-- of what has come and what has yet to come.                          --

--    Centuries ago Raumdor flourished with life and goodness. There   --
-- was hardly any evil to be found, although evil did exist. The races --
-- that prevail dominantly are elves, dwarves, humans and goblins.     --
--                                                                     --
--    Elves were the oldest race to flourish and they chose to live in --
-- the forests and the thickly wooded mountain ranges to the southwest --
-- and the forests that had once encompassed of the area now known as  --
-- city of Drakmere.                                                   --

--    Dwarves were the next oldest of races that were known throughout --
-- Raumdor. They lived in the mountain ranges to the north and eastern --
-- section of the area now known as city of Drakmere.                  --
--                                                                     --
--    Goblins were known to exist in the desert mountain ranges in the --
-- southern region. They lived in caves and so were rarely seen. They  --
-- preferred the desert region south of the rocky mountain areas as    --
-- well and were hardly ever seen north where the elves and dwarves    --
-- lived.                                                              --

--    Humans migrated to the area that is now known as Drakmere, from  --
-- the southeastern region. Not much was known about them but finding  --
-- their appearance not as crude as dwarves and similar to themselves, --
-- elves accepted them perhaps more so than dwarves. Soon the humans   --
-- began to dominate the area.                                         --

--    Elves live in heavily dense woods or forest areas. They prefer   --
-- the setting of living with nature in the trees. They have a natural --
-- instinct with magic and much knowledge in herbs. Their life style   --
-- may seem simple at times but they carry the wealth of knowledge     --
-- that only centuries can bring. They have a long life span, which    --
-- encompasses centuries.                                              --

--    Much of the elven trade consists of medicines, herb, potions and --
-- finely crafted items such as silk and linen. Tracking is another    --
-- attribute that they would render their services for.                --
--                                                                     --

--    Dwarves lived in the forests in the north and eastern mountain   --
-- ranges. They however were adaptable so that they created their      --
-- homes in the forests and in the numerous mountain caves that        --
-- flourished. They have a knack for finding ore deposits. So there    --
-- are many mining communities.                                        --
--                                                                     --
--    Dwarves had a strength and knowledge of using ore, which brought --
-- them to producing metals. They were master craftsman in the         --
-- creation of armours and weapons. They had such a talent for this,   --
-- that much of their trade was focused in this area.                  --
--                                                                     --

--    Goblins are not the prettiest of races according to elves, and   --
-- both elves and dwarves pretty much despise them for the vulgarity   --
-- that seems to be an inbred trait. The goblins preferred to stay in  --
-- the desert mountainous ranges of the southern region. They prefer   --
-- the dark dank caves although they also like to scour the desert     --
-- floors in the south during the night.                               --
--                                                                     --
--    There were some trade routes that were established with the      --
-- humans however. Goblins were known to raid settlements far south,   --
-- and bring some goods to trade and barter with.                      --
--                                                                     --

--    Humans brought with them knowledge of construction. They could   --

--    The arrival of humans brought about new and interesting          --
-- developments in cultures that were never known before. The humans   --
-- that created the great city of Drakmere followed the deity known as --
-- Drakin. This alone brought about a new conscience awareness to the  --
-- other races.                                                        --

--    Dwarves and elves associated with each other but mainly only in  --
-- trade. Elves basically thought the dwarves were a crude species and --
-- in turn dwarves felt that elves were too soft for their own good.   --
-- But each race did acknowledge the worth of the other, and thus had  --
-- a simple trade system.                                              --
--                                                                     --
--    The humans being similar in appearance with elves were able to   --
-- form a more compatible relationship with them. Humans being unique  --
-- were also able to easily fit in with dwarves because of their       --
-- knowledge of ore, metals and masonry work. Dwarves had a certain    --
-- respect for humans, but still kept somewhat of a distance and       --
-- stayed in their mountain for the most part. And lastly goblins and  --
-- humans were able to trade effectively as well.                      --
--                                                                     --
--    For many years the elves, dwarves, goblins and humans lived in a --
-- harmony that wasn't blissful by any means, but more a toleration of --
-- each other. Which was mainly due to the fact that each race had     --
-- become somewhat dependent with the other for their trade.           --
--                                                                     --
--    This harmonious relationship lasted for centuries. The elves     --
-- maintained their homes in the forests and the dwarves in the        --
-- mountain north of Drakmere and the humans in Drakmere. The humans   --
-- even expanded south and southeast of Drakmere and formed more       --
-- cities. While the goblins stayed far south and if they had expanded --
-- it wasn't visibly seen due to the nature of goblins.                --
--                                                                     --

--    Drakmere area had been a heavily dense forest, but evolved into  --
-- a town when the trees were cut and stripped to build homes and      --
-- shops, which now has flourished into a city. Drakmere was known for --
-- commerce, trade, construction and politics since it became the      --
-- Capital city-state of the verdant region. The Kuhl's of Drakin were --
-- the upholders of its laws and ways and helped bring about its rise  --

--    The Knights of Thanar began to slowly infiltrate Drakmere. These --
-- knights came from the now lost city of Kabal. At first, they didn't --
-- seem much like a threat. But now Drakmere is fighting for its life  --
-- and its citizenry. The Knights of Thanar have corrupted many of the --
-- citizens and the Kuhlof Drakin with their evilness.             --
--                                                                     --
--    The Knights of Thanar have been successfully thrown out of the   --
-- city, but the damage has been done. Drakmere is not what it was.    --
-- Evil has corrupted the city and their forces have been weakened,    --

-- simply because of how hazardous it is to travel there. The climate  --

----  There are a few deities that are worshiped in Raumdor. Some are  --

----  DRAKIN AND DETHRIN  ----                                         --
--                                                                     --
--    Drakin and Dethrin are listed together because they are twin     --
-- brothers. So they are intertwined in many of the legends, stories   --
-- throughout history. What is common in their history is this that    --
-- Drakin and Dethrin were twin brothers that were born of the goddess --
-- Solaru on the eve of sanction in Raumdor.                           --
--                                                                     --
--    Drakin being first born was granted the sun and Dethrin being    --
-- second was granted the moon. They grew up as most brothers, or gods --
-- would. They played havoc whenever they could. But on the morning of --
-- their 200th year Dethrin became jealous of the attention Dau'ru     --
-- (Their father) bestowed upon his elder twin brother.                --
--                                                                     --
--     This began a rift between brothers that has continued unto this --
-- day. Solaru became extremely disappointed in both her sons as the   --
-- time past it became worse. One day she could take no more and spoke --
-- with their father. Dan'ru became so angry over the distress that    --
-- they had caused Solaru that he cast them out.                       --
--                                                                     --
--    They fell to the earth in a tremendous burning flame. Neither    --
-- would speak to each other, but both fell to their sanctioned home,  --
-- which was Raumdor. Drakin still in command of the sun and Dethrin of--
-- the moon made Raumdor their home. Each wanting to find favor once   --
-- again in their parents eyes so that they may return.                --
--                                                                     --
--    This began what is what we call the beginning of evil vs good.   --
-- Drakin quickly had a following of mortals because of the beauty of  --
-- light that he was able to possess. Dethrin's jealousy of his brother--
-- grew into something more twisted and soon he had his own following  --
-- of darkness. Both trying to defeat the other and win favor once     --
-- again so they may return home.                                      --
--                                                                     --
----  THANAR  ----                                                     --

--    Thanar was the sole deity worshipped by the Kaladian humans. He  --
-- has played a pivotal role in the ascension of humanity to its       --
-- position of dominance over other races. It is uncertain why this    --
-- god has shown such a preference for humans, but the outcome is an   --
-- increase in both his power as well as his worshippers.              --
--                                                                     --
--    As time has past his increasingly belligerent faith rose in      --
-- favor with the common masses. Now, his name is more feared than     --
-- worshipped, due to his following, the knights of Thanar. They are   --
-- known to unmercifully slay all non-humans for no other reason but   --
-- for not being human. They slay humans who will not follow Thanar    --
-- and worship him as well.                                            --
--                                                                     --
--    But with the fall of Kabal the Knights are now few, but all fear --
-- their rising and regrouping that could be occurring in Nagaroth.    --
--                                                                     --

----  KUHL OF DRAKIN  ----                                             --
--                                                                     --
--    The Kuhl of Drakin is an enforcement group. They are followers   --
-- of Drakin, and defenders of Drakmere. Some call them knights, since --
-- kuhl and knight is interchangeable. They are honorable and          --
-- respectable defenders of Drakmere. They were the first order        --
-- authorized by the Lords of Drakmere to carry out their will.  Not   --
-- much is known about their past at this time due to the destruction  --
-- of many parts of Drakmere.                                          --
--                                                                     --
--    But this much is known. Their downfall began with the Sunaji, as --
-- they used to be the emissaries between the Keepers of the Sunaji    --
-- and the Lords of Drakmere. Facilitation good will and all that.     --
--                                                                     --
--    When the Sunaji began to turn towards Darkness the Thanar        --
-- arrived in Drakmere. Between the hate that Thanar brought against   --
-- the Sunaji and the turmoil of the evil influence is was the         --
-- beginning of the end. Thanar's influence was paying heavily upon    --
-- Drakmere. Riots were raging and the Lord's were looking toward the  --
-- Kuhl for assistance but many among them had been seduced by         --
-- Thanar's propaganda. This left the Kuhl of Drakin out numbered.     --
--                                                                     --
--    The Kuhl of Drakin was dwindling and forces were out opposing    --
-- the Sunaji because of the evil that has possessed them. The Lords   --
-- were unable to salvage the Kuhl of Drakin and save them from this   --
-- new evil that had the Sunaji in its grip.                           --
--                                                                     --
--    They then formed a new Protectorate and officially reconstructed --
-- Kuhl of Drakin and forcefully banished those who had become became  --
-- followers of Thanar as well. The now surviving followers of Drakin  --
-- concentrated all their efforts and called upon the magic of the     --
-- ages and of Drakin to eradicate the Thanar from their beloved city. --
--                                                                     --
--    No one knows how this occurred only that Thanar was removed and  --
-- the city, then news reached Drakmere that the city of Kabal was a   --
-- burning pile of rubble. Fear of the Thanar returning caused the     --
-- Lord's of Drakmere to restore the Kuhl of Drakin to protect their   --
-- city. The order is now few, and the threat of Sunaji still          --
-- lingering.                                                          --
