                                   CREATION                                    
===============================================================================

Not all is fully understood about the Creation. In fact, nothing is known about
what exists on the other side of the Veil, a boundary only permeable by the
deitites and undiluted spirits. The Creator and Nameless One arrived into this
plane in the same ebb of time known as The Crossing.

The Creator brought forth firmament, forming all that is material in the world.
The Nameless One set his will towards contorting the firmament, setting in
motion their timeless struggle.

The above is consistent with the story as told by all. However, the details
are in dispute.

It is believed that unknown spirits first crossed the Veil and were pursued by
the Creator, who sought to return with them. The Nameless One, who was either
accompanying the spirits in some capacity or in pursuit himself, desired to
set them free.

The Creator brought forth the firmament in order to intervene, either in an
effort to rescue the spirits or to restrain them. Not having the power to
destroy the firmament, the Nameless One set about to disentangle the spirits
from it, thereby releasing them from the Creator's direct influence.

Death, as it is called, is only partial disentanglement from the firmament.
What remains is called a soul. Devotees of the Nameless One believe such souls
should be taken to Hell, a realm as distant from the Veil as can be achieved,
where they can be further disentangled and given autonomy.

Devotees of the Creator believe souls should go to Heaven, a realm adjascent to
the Veil, where souls can be cleansed and rejoined with other spirits. Their
ultimate goal is to gather all spirits together, return through the Veil, and
undo The Crossing.

The Mortal Realm is where the firmament gathers, as it is inclined to do. Those
with particularly heavy souls are unable to leave the Mortal Realm even upon
death, haunting it until their burdens are released. However, most souls arrive
in The Netherworld, the realm between all other realms.

It is in the largely desolate void of The Netherworld where the forces of Heaven
and Hell most commonly battle for unclaimed souls. However, it is not without
precedent that powerful spirits have donned the burden of firmament to return to
the Mortal Realm. Such are the tales of angels and demons.

                                   HISTORY                                    
===============================================================================

A work in progress, attempting to build first upon what is in the game, then
secondly what has been in the game before, and subsequently what has been
revealed to mortals or otherwise conceived of, but not published.

Of immediate relevance are the following:

The undead of the Forest of Shadows drain the life force of the forest.  The
flats to its north and south are testimony to this depletion. The servants of
the Nameless One are thus ever pushed towards new areas as they deplete old
ones. In this case, it pushes them eastward.

The holy symbol of those who worship the Creator is the Sun, or stars more
generally. This should replace references to the cross or other references that
might easily be confused as a reference to any specific real-world religion.
Rays of light penetrating the clouds, something resembling the Sun on a horizon,
constellations of stars, etc. are all suitable for such symbolism.
