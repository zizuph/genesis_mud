The City of Nyby

While in constant alert due to the vile undead that roam the outside forest of 
Raumdor, the city of Nyby struggles with it's ideals as much as it struggles 
with it's economy, labour force and access to resources. 

The surrounding undead make it hard to bring in supplies and basic 
neccessities, particularly in large quanta. Everyone is hungry, always.

Due to past mistakes for which the land as a whole now suffers, traditional
government has been deemed too dangerous. It is decided that anyone driven 
by ambition is deemed unfit to lead. Leadership is a burden, and a burden that
should only be held by the most learned. 

As such, Nyby has decided to educate its' citizens equally untill talent and
purpose is revealed. Once a talent has been revealed, the citizen becomes one
of four classes: Workers, Tradesmen, Guardians or Philosophers.

The Workers keep the city clean, they repair or improve on walls, towers and
buildings. Their professions are either masonry or carpentry. Due to the 
general shortage of anything, Workers are sometimes seen in the streets, 
begging.

The Tradesmen are supposed to make the economic wheels spin by fabricating,
producing and/or selling goods or services. Exports are important, and if it
wasn't for the lack of raw materials, being a Tradesman in Nyby would have
been very lucrative. Due to the state of things, many lack the customer base
to stay afloat and are subsequently struggling to put food on the table.

The Guardians are the fighters, the warriors. Their sole purpose in life is
to protect the city from intruders and occasionally maintain order in 
particularly hard times. The only Guardian who does not serve actively as
a part of the city's defence is the Sheriff - a thankless position granted
the injured or the weak. 

Anyone who wants to become a philosopher is automatically disqualified from
becoming one. Nyby has no room for personal ambition, particularly not among
it's most learned. A Philosopher exist only to expand his own, and others', 
knowledge. The Philosophers teach the children, partake in democratic processes
when needed. 

Only the Philosopher class produce Leaders, and a new leader is ordered to
serve by the Philosophers. They are driven by a desire to know more, not power
over others, and such only serve maximum 5 years of their life as Leader. While
they may find slight annoyance in being forced to Lead against their will, they
acknowledge the importance of leadership and do so to the best of their
ability. 



Life, family and procreation

To quell any thoughts of nepotism, the Guardians and Philosophers do not
have children. If accidents happen (and they do, frequently), the accidental 
child is adopted by a Worker or Tradesman family. The parents' class have
no influence in later class distribution.

Efforts towards limiting the production of accidental children, many have
sought the company of equal gender. Some even live together, happily.

Workers and Tradesmen live together in family units and are obliged to be
fruitful and multiply. Naturally, their children make out the recruitment 
base for all classes.
