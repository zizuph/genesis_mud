                     How to handle the horses. 
        After you bought the horse you should name it by 
           name horse <my_name> 
        since then it will be a lot more difficult for others to steal it. 
        You mount the horse with 
           mount <my_name>|horse 
        It is wise to use the name you gave to the horse because it will  
        recognise you easier. It also helps if you are skillful of dealing  
        with animals. When mounted you dismount with 
           dismount 
        You command the horse (when mounted) in certain directions with 
           cmd <dir> 
        The horse will then move one step in the (exit) direction <dir>. 
        To make the horse run you use 
           cmd <dir> <how> 
        where <dir> is a direction and <how> is either 
           slowly, gently, quickly, or rapidly 
        which indicates the pace. The horse will then start to move, 
        at the selected pace, in the direction <dir>. If the exit <dir> 
        doesn't exist, it will try to move in neighbouring directions. 
        For instance; 'cmd n gently' will also try ne and nw. The horse 
        will stop when no exits are available. 
        Moreover, it is usually impossible to ride the horse in an indoor 
        room; this stable is one exception. 
        Some other commands are: 
           cmd halt                  will stop the horse from running 
           cmd enter mist            may also work if allowed by the room 
           board ship with horse     for ships (soon to be implemented) 
           cmd disembark             for ships (soon to be implemented) 
        Certain commands, i.e. shout and say, will be heard outside the 
        horse. In its present version no emotional commands will be heard, 
        but the rider will hear and see everything from the horse back. 

        The 'cmd' part is not necessary now if the next argument is a 
        direction or halt. Thus, the commands 
           w quickly 
           halt 
        will work. Moreover, it is now possible to ride through gates, 
        like the one up at the northern port. Also, if you happen to fall 
        off the horse you may want to try 
           halt <my_name> | horse 
        when standing next to it.
