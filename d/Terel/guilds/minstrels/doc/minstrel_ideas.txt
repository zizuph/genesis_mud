CONCEPTS FOR REFINEMENT:

Inclusion of performance reputation
===================================
Reputation from performing is based on the 2nd edition Bard performance
levels:

0 Unsung
1 Accepted
2 Known
3 Noted
4 Established
5 Liked
6 Well-known
7 Admired
8 Prominent
9 Distinguished
10 Popular
11 Reputable
12 Honored
13 Celebrated
14 Illustrious
15 Eminent
16 Acclaimed
17 Prestigious
18 Famous/Infamous
19 Renowned
20 Revered

All existing Minstrels have a base reputation up to level 6 (well-known) based 
on their guild stat (guild level / 7). 

[guildstat / 21].

Non-minstrels may also use this system to perform with instruments and gain
reputation. They start at unsung and are likely to progress more slowly
through the ranks, as they do not benefit from having a performing or singing
skill.

To advance beyond that level they need to perform in locations that have 
the property "_minstrel_performance_location" added to the room. These rooms 
tend to be inns, taverns, auditoriums.

The property format is:

          Property name,                     LOCATION NAME, LOCATION SIZE
add_prop("_minstrel_performance_location", ({ "hawkstones taproom", 1 }) );

Location name is checked for repeat performances. One can only perform for
reputation once every 20 hours at the same location.

Location size is a number ranging from 1 to 3, indicating the size of the
establishment and the likelihood for a reputation increase:

1. Drinking Hole - e.g out of the way towns, low patronage
   e.g. Flotsam's Hawkstones Taproom
2. Small Pub / Small Inn - standard establishments, average patronage
   e.g. Port Balifors Pig and Whistle Inn, Solace Inn of the Last Home.
3. Large Pub / Large Inn - prominent establishment, high profile patronage
e.g. Sparkle inn, Bree 'Dancing Pony', Palanthas

When performing a mundane or ballard at such an establishment there is a 
chance of a reputation increase:

Chance based on:
* current reputation title 
* Establishment level
* singing and playing skills.

INCREASE IF: chance > difficulty

chance = random(100 * establishment level) + singing skill + performing skill
             [value between 0 and 219 for superior craftsman skills, tier 1 venue]
             [value between 0 and 318 for superior craftsman skills, tier 2 venue]
             [value between 0 and 417 for superior craftsman skills, tier 3 venue]
difficulty = (current title * 10) + random(300) 
             [value between 0 - 489]

These are managed in the performance_manager.c as

    chance = PERFORM_MANAGER->check_performance_chance(minstrel, loc_size);
    difficulty = PERFORM_MANAGER->check_performance_difficulty(minstrel);




PERFORMANCE PAYOUT
==================
The number of musical renditions you need to give before the performance
is complete depends on the size of the establishment... between one to
three. The owner of the establishment pays the performer at the end of a 
successful performance for each rendition based on how well they performed,
measured by the 'chance' value returned for each rendition:

                         Payout influenced by performer's skills
                     Sup craftsman skills:     Superior guru skills:
1. Drinking Hole:       120cc - 219cc             200cc - 299cc
2. Average venue:       240cc - 438cc             400cc - 598cc 
3. Prominent venue:     480cc - 657cc             800cc - 1196cc 

So the maximum payout for a layman member with max lay skills (superior
craftsman) is around:
* 1 gold, 6 silver, 3 copper in a dive/drinking hole
* 3 gold 6 copper in an average venue
* 4 gold 6 silver in a prominent venue

// Can only increase your reputation once every 20 hours.

Code checks:
Command for performing mundanes and ballards are in the guild soul. From 
here:
- check whether room is a reputation establishment
- check minstrel admin.c file to see if minstrel has performed in the 
establishment in the last 20 hours
- check minstrel admin.c for chance of reputation increase.

Decrease in reputation
======================
High reputation has a chance of decaying if you don't regularly perform.

Those minstrels above a reputation of 10 who haven't performed in the last
week have a chance of their reputation decaying upon logging in based on
a x% chance based on 'days of having not performed' + current level.

The amount of decay is equals the number of weeks having not performed,
reducing at most to a reputation level of 10.


New ability: Minstrel auras
===========================
Upon reaching reputation 10, a Minstrel is invited to the College of
Music in Telberin, where they learn more about the history of the Muses
as well as how to potentially generate a 'minstrel aura' that provides
beneficial effects to the Minstrel's team or debuffs to non-team
members.

Specific details to be determined.

CLUB
=====
For a minstrel club, they'll need elements of the soul for performing... (do_performance etc)
be able to create mundane songs
Have elements of the shadow (like query_instrument) for it to work


















    In days of ancient lore, the muses who brought joy to the world where known
    as Melete, Mneme, and Aoide which loosely translates to Practice, Memory, 
    and Song.  Music was very beautiful and very uniform.  Its sole purpose 
    was to enlighten and please the listener.  Through the ages, while styles
    have progressed, musics main purpose has never changed.

    At the end of the days of ancient lore, nine muses came to us bringing 
    with them the different styles of music being epic, historic, lyric, 
    comedic, tragic, lively, heartfelt, sacred, and mystic.  This music was 
    created using the diatonic scale to fill the land with joy.  

    A century later music changed when Thamyris started creating songs with 
    the root note being the second note of the diatonic scale.  This Dorian 
    scale led to the next revolution of music.  From this came songs of 
    darkness and sadness.  The nine muses cultivated this style as it 
    increased their power two fold.  Thamyris, known as the greatest minstrel 
    in the land challenged them to a singing contest.  He was no competition 
    for the muses and as punishment for his presumption, they cut out his 
    tongue and took his instruments so he may never please another mortal 
    again.  The unjust punishment and fear of the dark songs brought the wraith 
    of the other gods and a battle in the heavens fill the night sky.  
    Five muses were never seen again.

    The four remaining muses led our ancestors in the exodus of the old land.
    While only four muses could be seen, it is said that we would not have 
    survived the journey without the three sets of three muses that guided 
    us to Terel.

    While their names may not be known to us, we know that muses always work in
    threes.  When you feel their effects, it is the combined power of all three.


    Proposed Minstrel Changes
    The below proposal should add many original concepts to the Minstrels guild
    and increase role playing on the donut.  The changes will give minstrels
    hours of game play entertainment and increase the minstrels value in a team.
    Minstrel joining requirements:
    The joining requirements for minstrels will be removed and the black list 
    cleared.  Player who wish to be added back can go on a killing spree in
    the Minstrel Palace for the quickest results.  Dark title options will also
    be selectable for minstrels who wish their stage persona to emphasize the 
    bad boy/girl image.  A percussion instrument or two will be added for players
    who don't look good playing a wind or string instrument.
    Minstrel Skills
    Perform - superior guru - Merged from Play Instrument, Sing and Read Music
    Tune/Repair Instrument - reduce to superior journeyman
    Language - superior craftsman
    New Skills 
    Spellcraft - superior craftsman
    pick pocket - superior acolyte
    acrobat - superior acolyte
    appraise skills - superior acolyte
    New Anybody Skill
    Heckling Skill - superior amateur -  Heckling is a new skill that anyone 
    can obtain that allows the heckler a % chance to disrupt a minstrels 
    mundane song. The affect is cumulative for all members in a mob. This skill 
    can be temporarily affected by pax.
    In the same room as a heckler heckling, all living can heckle the minstrel 
    at the skill level of 10% of the hecklers skill.
    Cheering action 
    New action for all living in the area to cheer a minstrel when a mundane song
    is being playing. Cheering for a minstrel subtracts the current heckler 
    disruption chance and votes up their song.
    Genesis Top 100 Songs
    The Genesis Top 100 songs list is decided by the genesis players and NPCs.
    Every time a song is played and finished in an accredited venue the song 
    ranking is given a boost based upon the venue size.  Any time a minstrel plays
    in the presence of a players or NPCs, the players and NPCs can cast their vote 
    by cheering or boo'ing the minstrel.  Some NPCs can be quite the critics.
    Every four hours, the top 100 song's rankings are updated.  176 songs that
    were longer than 750 character were selected and ranked.  Several existing 
    players already have songs in the top 100.  One who is currently on the 
    Minstrels black list has 6 in the top 50.  When joining the Minstrels, if you
    have a song on the list, it will be automatically added to your songbook.
    Minstrel Achievements - Reputation
    The achievement tasks for the minstrels falls along two different paths.  
    The first is playing mundane songs at venues and the second is promoting 
    an original song through the top 10 on the Genesis top 100 list.
    Minstrels Gig at venues across the Donut.
    To successfully complete a gig, the player must arrive at the venue location
    and start the gig no more than 30 minutes late.  Gigs cannot start early.  
    The minstrel must sing the required number of sets with each set being at 
    least 10 minutes long and consisting of a minimum of 5 songs.  A break of 
    2-5 minutes is to be taken between sets.  If food or drink are provided by 
    the publican, the minstrel must consume it during the break.  At smaller 
    venues, the minstrel is paid by the publican and must pay the agent his fee 
    from the gig to get the achievement and to get the next gig.  
    The minstrel may sing Pax between each song.
    There a 6 different levels of venues where a minstrel can play.  Each level
    requires the minstrel to know more and more popular songs and have a higher
    minimum performance skill.  Minstrel achievements are awarded for:
    Minstrel Achievement:   Played 1 gig at a <venue type>
                            Played 5 gigs at different <venue type>

    Minstrel Auras
    Minstrel auras consist of the aura of the muse they selected when receiving 
    an instrument and the additional aura of two changing muses which are randomly
    selected once per Armageddon.  The aura has a chance to activated when the 
    minstrel sings a mundane song.  When the aura is activated, it contains the 
    combined effect from all three muses.  Each time a minstrel performs a 
    stanza of a mundane song, there is a chance the aura may activate.  The 
    aura lasts for period of time and once ended, and after a short cool off
    period the aura can be activated again.  If the minstrel is only singing or 
    playing instead of performing, the chance of triggering the aura drops in 
    half per stanza.  Playing an instrument while engaged in combat greatly
    increases the chance of instrument damage.
    Each unique song on the top 100 list can trigger an aura effect when being 
    played only if the song hasn't been sung by the minstrel and triggered an 
    aura effect in the last two hours.  Minstrels must have a varied and popular
    repertoire to constantly received the aura. 
    The strength of the aura is determined by the ranking of the song in the 
    Genesis top 100 songs list.  Songs outside the top 100 provide no aura effect.
    The effect of the muse aura is given below
    Four permanent muses - Primary muse was selected when instrument was chosen
                           Muse does not change for a minstrel
    *Calliope    (epic poetry)                 Slow - Limits non team members moves 
                                                      to 1 room per second
    *Clio        (history)                     Extra AC
    *Thalia      (comedy and pastoral poetry)  Deception - Lowers non team members
                                                           awareness 
    *Melpomene   (tragedy)                     Extra Damage
     -
    Changing Muses - These Muses are randomly selected once per Armageddon
     Euterpe     (flutes and lyric poetry)     Discipline Boost
     Terpsichore (dance)                       Dexterity Boost
     Erato       (love poetry)                 Strength Boost
     Polyhymnia  (sacred poetry)               Health Regen

    Minstrel NPCs
    Minstrel Agent - The achievement master hands out the gigs and ticket books 
                     to minstrels and awards minstrel achievements for 
                     completing gigs.  He doesn't care if a minstrel didn't make
                     it to a gig, he wants his 15% if he gave out the gig.
    Wandering Minstrel - Teaches mundane songs to players for a cost.
                         Can learn songs from a minstrel to add to his songbook.
                         Knows the #1 song from last Armageddon.
                         Randomly knows 3 others from the top 10, 5 more songs 
                         between the top 10 and the top 25, and 16 more up to #200
                         Provides hints about the current muse auras.
                         Accepts gigs from the agent, uses the venue guide to 
                         travels to the venue, plays the gig, and returns. 
    Minstrel Groupies - Accepts tickets to gigs and will use the venue guide 
                        to be in the audience at the show.  Groupies will follow
                        artists with songs in the top 10 if they don't have
                        gig to go to.  Groups also try to go to all of the 
                        festivals.
    Hospitality Workers - food and drink workers for the festival
    The Hecklers - Mainly found in the heckle room.  A small group stalk the 
                   groupies.  If given a ticket to a show, they will attend 
                   to practice their favourite skill.  Anyone can give a heckler
                   any ticket and they will attend the next show they have a 
                   ticket for.
    Comments and Feedback welcome.


Proposed performing locations. Conceptually, we
want to limit the number of 'prominent' locations
for each domain... making minstrels travel good
distances to go to the best performing locations.
