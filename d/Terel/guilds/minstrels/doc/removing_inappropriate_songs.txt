It will be inevitable players will come up with inappropriate songs.

To remove them follow the following steps.

1. CHECK NAME OF SONG
Firstly, check what the song name is via:

Call /d/Terel/cedric/guild/log/songbook_manager.c query_mundane_songs <player name>

This will return a list of songs of the player, such as:

Array of size 2
(Array)
[0] = (string) "king_of_mine.song"
[1] = (string) "queen_of_hearts_gone_too_soon.song"
[2] = (string) "when_hitler_took_over.song"

2. REMOVE SONG FILE

Call /d/Terel/cedric/guild/log/songbook_manager.c remove_mundane_songs <player name>%%"when_hitler_took_over.song"

3. REMOVE FROM TOP 20 LIST ON GENESIS WEBSITE

If the song is listed in the top 20 List, you will need to manually 
remove it via:

Call /d/Terel/guilds/minstrels/lib/performance_manager.c remove_minstrel_mundane "When Hitler Took Over"

You can check if it was appropriately removed through:

Call /d/Terel/guilds/minstrels/lib/performance_manager.c query_top_minstrel_mundanes

If the song is no longer in that array then after around 10 minutes
it will be removed from https://www.genesismud.org/rankings.php
