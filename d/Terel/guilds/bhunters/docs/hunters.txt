Bounty Hunters

 Theme:

Guild members dedicate themselves to hunting and
killing players for bounty. There are no rules
or guildlines of behavior for them, altough those
who don't claim rewards often enough will be limited
in using guild abilities. Only players who recieved
at least one reward in bounty hunters office are
allowed to join. (That include those who achieved
that before the guild is opened)


 Guild abilities:

Members are able to buy special items in guild shop,
those can be used to set various traps listed and
described in separate document. Trap elements can't be
bought for ordinary money but for special coins.
Each member can get small amount of those coins periodicaly
in guild startloc (10 per reboot). More of them are
given to player every time he claims a reward in
bounty hunters office (1 coin for every 50 pc of bounty
claimed).

  Other:

Few special effects will apply to bounty hunters at the
office in Last (/d/Terel/last/bounty_office.c)

- guild members can't place rewards.
- guild member can 'declare hunt' there, so given wanted
 poster is removed and none else interferes.
- guild members can view a list of bounties in any location.
- at the tavern in town of Last bounty hunters can 'ask
 for rumors' about specific player with reward for, and will
 get name of the domain that player is currently in.
