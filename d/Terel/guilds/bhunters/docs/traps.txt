Traps ideas:

  Only one trap can be placed per room. Laying a trap
checks special 'traps' skill on bounty hunter.
  Avoiding the trap checks find/remove traps on victim,
difficulty of that test is determined on score hunter
got in his when placing it.
  All trap elements must be carried with hunter to
lay it. Elements can be bought at guild shop, but
for special coins rather then normal currency.
Those special coins can be earned for bounties
(one coin for every 50pc of reward), they are also
given to each guild member periodicaly in small
amount (like 10 per reboot).
Prices in those special coins are listed in square 
brackets below.

  Every trap takes from 2 to 5 minutes to set.
