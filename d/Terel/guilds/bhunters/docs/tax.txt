traps:

Instead of taxing particular traps I decided to tax the
required skill (with 4.0 modifier):

 set traps	     75		0	    75		5.0			


Traps cost, to reduce number of traps in game I designed trap
components system. Traps are built from components, that
are available in guild shop (Only those components are there, so
I added no tax for that shop). Traps can't be bounght for
money but special tokens.

Each member gets 20 of those tokens plus twice his
rank in guild, once an arma (only if he logs on during it).
(Rank can only be gained by collecting bounties
in office in Last - one rank per one killed player)

For example, characted who killed 2 players for rewards,
will get 24 tokens each arma, which is enough for 
compliting 4-12 traps.

Traps' effects are powerfull, but also very hard to use
Guild member would have to predict where victim is going,
and be sure no third person would trigger the trap.

To make it slightly easier to use traps, I've added alarm
(costs one token in guild shop) that, when attached to the
trap will notify it's owner when trap is triggered.
