Obfuscate
====================
Guild type          : Occupational
Effect              : Obfuscate allows a vampire to hide their presence 
                      through mental prowess.  When active, every living 
                      creature that comes into contact with them has a 
                      resolve_task based on opposing mental abilities.  
                      Bonuses are given for invisibility sight, and non-
                      humanoid nature. If success, the vampire is seen as 
                      usual, but if failure, the vampire is hidden for up 
                      to 5 minutes from that target. A vampire can cast 
                      this spell again, with a specific single target, if 
                      they wish to try harder to hide from that target.
    
                      This effect is blocked in combat - anyone fighting 
                      the vampire will always see through the effect.  
                      There is therefore no blindfighting bonus from this 
                      skill.

                      The mental test is presently:
                      if (player->resolve_task(TASK_SIMPLE, 
                      ({SS_AWARENESS, TS_INT, TS_WIS, SS_FORM_ILLUSION }),
                      vampire,
                      ({SS_AWARENESS, TS_INT, TS_WIS, SS_FORM_ILLUSION }))
                      > vampire->query_vamp_stat()/2) 

                      The resolve_task is reduced by 50 points when the
                      player has invis sight, and 100 points when the
                      player is not humanoid.  This leads to roughly an
                      75% chance of seeing through the illusion, given
                      equal stats, skills, and 0 vamp stat, and 42% at
                      100 vamp stat.
