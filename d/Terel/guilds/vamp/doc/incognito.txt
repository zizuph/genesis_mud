Guild type          : Occupational
Effect              : The caster uses their mind to imitate the features
                      of other livings they have met before.  Hair, 
                      eyes, nails and the short descriptions can be 
                      borrowed and imitated.  They can mix and match 
                      features, and the last 10 of any type are available.
                      
                      Others that mean the player can potentially see 
                      through the disguise.  It is based on this formula:
                      
                      if (player->resolve_task(TASK_SIMPLE, 
                      ({SS_AWARENESS, TS_INT, TS_WIS, SS_FORM_ILLUSION }),
                      vampire,
                      ({SS_AWARENESS, TS_INT, TS_WIS, SS_FORM_ILLUSION }))
                      > vampire->query_vamp_stat()/2) 

                      The resolve_task is reduced by 100 points when the
                      player is not humanoid.  This leads to roughly an
                      75% chance of seeing through the illusion, given
                      equal stats, skills, and 0 vamp stat, and 42% at
                      100 vamp stat, and even higher if the player has
                      invis sight or is not humanoid
