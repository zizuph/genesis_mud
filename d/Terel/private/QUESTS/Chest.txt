1   17  Cottage Chest Quest 

        Designer: Sorgum in 1994, implemented by Lilith in 2022.
		Problem:  The treasure chest in the cottage cellar is rusted shut. 
		Solution: Make thermite to melt the lock.
                  The recipe for thermite is 3 parts iron oxide (rust) 
                  to 1 part powdered aluminium. 
                  The player must find the flowerpot in the garden, figure 
                  out which powders to use from the ones available in the 
                  toolshed, and scrape rust off the stove in the kitchen.
                  Mix them together in the pot, and if its the wrong mixture,
                  it makes a gooey mess. If its the right mixture, they get
                  thermite.
                  If they try igniting the thermite as-is, they're going to 
                  get burned. Instead, a search of the mattresses in the 
                  bedrooms will turn up ribbons of magnesium. Put the pot
                  on the safe, put the magnesium ribbon in with the thermite,
                  ignite the ribbon, and the thermite burns down through the 
                  top of the chest and melts the lock.
        Skills:  None needed.
        Risks:   Player risks taking 25% - 50% hp damage if they blow the
                  thermite up.
        EXP:     500 Quest experience
        Reward:  Gold coins, some gems, a goblet, and the ring of the ancients.
		
        Notes:   This is a repeatable quest so players can get the ring.
