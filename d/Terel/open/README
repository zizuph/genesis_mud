   Terel was started by a few wizards from the Dville domain during the
summer of 1992.  Led by Mecien, these wizards quickly opened the largest, 
most popular domain in all of Genesis.
   The center of the domain is the forest village of Calathin.  It is a place
of mystic beauty, charming music, and mystery.  
   This town was pretty much founded by a Family known as the Avenchirs.  They
are mostly all dead now, but their mansion still stands, and it is said that
the few remaining family members that do exist still live there, although they
have gone rather mad.
   To the north of this wonderfull village lies a great forest.  Only bold and
intelligent adventurers can succesfully navigate it.  To the north of this 
forest, one can find a Cornerstone that holds ancient wisdom.  Trolls abound
to the north and east of the cornerstone, and some goblins live in the Ice
caves to the west.  It is said that a great underground network of tunnels
can be reached somewhere around there.  Not many have returned from those caves,
however.
   To the west of Calathin lies a path that ends in a 1000 foot drop into a
great valley.  Nestled within this valley is the Kingdom of Ribos.  Beware, 
the Kingdom of Ribos has been plagued with a Great Evil.  Only a strong and
brave individual can hope to survive there.
   To the south of Calathin, one can find a great Gypsy camp, with lots 
to do.    Further south is the Port town of Lorusel, where great sea ships
connect the entire continent with the rest of the world.
   Beware, because Terel is a cold place, and you should always dress warm.  Winter is pretty
much a constant here, and the townspeople rely on hunting for meat to
survive.
