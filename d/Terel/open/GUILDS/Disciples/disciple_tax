Guild Tax Calculation for the Disciples of Dark Song Guild

COMBAT 

The Disciples have no special attacks, or combat ariented skills.  
There is an attack spell, as well as a spell which starts an attack, 
but does not actually reduce HP  (it reduces DEX for no more than
20 seconds before restoring it).  As the minstrels are taxed, I will 
tax this under the 'Additional Features' category.

SKILLS

                 <109> language:  75 

I will consider this to be worth 1% tax. This is conservative, 
if anything.  The rules imply that this should be about 0.25% tax

The following skills are guild-specific and serve only to qualify
the abilities of novice Disciples, so I do not tax them. Or, put
another way, I calculate the guild tax based on the assumption that
the Disciples has maxed each of these skills.

                  <130051> sing: 100      = 100
<130053> tune/repair instrument: 100      = 100 
            <130052> read music: 100      = 100
       <130050> play instrument: 100      = 100


SPECIAL ABILITIES

Inherent telepathic abilities:

Members are notifed when another member logs on but they do not know
which guildmember it was unless they have that guildmember remembered.
There is no tell line but the members have the ability to play certain 
songs (Ballads); all listening disciples will hear the ballad title and 
the name of the performer.  I do not think this qualifies as a tell line
but is certainly worth something. Since a full-blown member-to-member tell 
costs 2% tax, I charge 1% tax for the Ballads.

Special bargains:

There is a post offce and a tavern inside the guild.  The shop does
not offer any special bargains however.

Weapon racks:

None
