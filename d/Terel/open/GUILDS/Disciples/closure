It has been determined by members of the Admin, the former Lord Sorgum, and
current Lord Shinto that the Disciples guild should be closed for
various reasons. 

    - The guild was poorly coded and is still filled with numerous bugs.
    - The Guildmaster has disappeared and there is no one to take over.
    - It is the belief of the Liege that the idea for the guild was
      not well-planned nor thought out, and should not have been opened.
    - Several members of the Admin have expressed the same feelings. As
      well as various balance and code quality problems with the guild.

Our hope is that the guild can be closed as soon as possible so
that work on a similar guild to help replace this and
the Minstrel guild can be worked on.

Lord Shinto of Terel
