Guild Tax Calculation for the Minstrel Guild

COMBAT AID

The minstrels do not provide any special attacks, or even train any
combat oriented skills.  The do have an attack spell though.  As I did
for the mystics, I will tax this under the 'Additional Features'
category.

SKILLS

                 <109> language:  60 

I will consider this to be worth 1% tax. This is conservative, if anything;
the rules imply that this should be about 0.5% tax

The following skills are guild-specific and serve only to qualify
the abilities of novice Minstrels, so I do not tax them. Or, put
another way, I calculate the guild tax based on the assumption that
the Minstrel has maxed each of these skills.

                  <130051> sing: 100      = 100
<130053> tune/repair instrument: 100      = 100 
            <130052> read music: 100      = 100
       <130050> play instrument: 100      = 100


SPECIAL ABILITIES

Inherent telepathic abilities:

Members are notifed when another member logs on but they do not know
which guildmember it was unless they have that guildmember remembered.
There is no tell line but the members have the ability to play certain 
songs (Ballads); all listening minstrels will hear the ballad title and 
the name of the performer.  I do not think this qualifies as a tell line
but is certainly worth something. Since a full-blown member-to-member tell 
costs 2% tax, I charge 1% tax for the Ballads.

Special bargains:

There is a post offce and a tavern inside the guild.  The shop does
not offer any special bargains however.

Weapon racks:

None

Magic spells:

Songs of power:

refresh:  improves fatigue                                0.5%
peace:    stops fighting (re-attack is possible though)   0.5%
                                                          -----
TOTAL                                                     4.0%

Total Tax:                                                6.0%

Cedric has a lot of changes planned for the minstrels.  Long term
plans include making occ and club branches.
