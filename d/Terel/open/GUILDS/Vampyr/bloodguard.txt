--------
OVERVIEW
--------
  When the Emerald coven of Vampires joined with a vampyr in Terel a new 
coven was formed, and the Emerald kindred transformed, their line empowered 
through the ability to drink of the potent blood of the ancient one himself.
Part of this transformation was the return of the Bloodguard, those mortals
bound to serve the Vampyr through ties of loyalty and blood-thirst.

The Bloodguard are a layman guild. They remain fully mortal. Players can join
it with the intention of remaining lay members. They can also join with the 
hopes of being 'embraced' and made a full Vampyr.

JOINING THE BLOODGUARD
----------------------
  There are no restrictions on races or alignment. The only restriction is
that a player cannot join who is already undead. 

  Any player can walk into the crypt and join. The Eldest will ask if they
have come to offer their blood. If they wish to do so, they respond with
<offer blood to statue>. After drinking from them, the Eldest will ask the
player if he wants a taste of what it is like to be one of them in exchange
for their loyalty, and warns that breaking their oath means death. If the
player wants to join, he simply types <accept>. At that point the player
experiences as transformation sequence of tells that gives information
about what is expected of them.

Once a member is a Bloodguard, is advise to find a master, but is not 
required to. Ostensibly, the master is the vampire whom they guard /
watch over.

----------------------
LEAVING THE BLOODGUARD 
----------------------
  To leave, a player goes to the crypt where the Eldest is and types 
<break oath>. The player will die as a consequence. There is no code in 
place to restrict members who leave from rejoining.

The guild-specific skills and the stat SS_LAY is also cleared upon leaving.
