--------
OVERVIEW
--------
  The Emerald coven of Vampires, ever nomadic and mysterious, abandoned their
tower on the mist isle in Emerald and joined with a vampyr in Terel, one who
guarded the vampyr known simply as "The Eldest". There, a new coven was formed,
and the Emerald kindred transformed, their line empowered through the ability 
to drink of the potent blood of the ancient one himself.


----------

------------------
JOINING THE VAMPYR
------------------
  To join the guild, the player must first be a Bloodguard, which any player
can become just by walking into the crypt and accepting blood from the npc
known as The Eldest. From there, a Bloodguard must be 'embraced' by an
active vampyr player in order to become a vampyr. The player then dies and
is transformed into an undead vampyr upon reincarnation.

  There are no restrictions on races. A player cannot join who is already 
undead. A Vampyr can embrace another player anywhere, there is no need to
be at the guild hall.


------------------
LEAVING THE VAMPYR
------------------
  While the Bloodguards have to <break oath> at the joining room and die as
a consequence, a Vampyr can leave the guild anytime and anywhere using the 
<vleave> command. There is no death penelty for Vampyrs leaving as they died 
once upon joining. There is no code in place to restrict members who leave 
from rejoining.

The guild-specific skills and the stat SS_OCCUP is also cleared upon leaving.


--------------------
SKILLS IN THE VAMPYR

  The maximum possible skills to train are defined in the file

SPECIAL ATTACKS
---------------
  The following special attacks are available for members of the guild:

  bite - The vampire's main attack. This is a standard attack which allows
selection of the specific hit location. This uses the standard damage library, 
with combat aid set to 80.

  flurry - Unleashes a string of 4 attacks to a single target with the weapon
in hand. This does 80% combat aid, and is occupational only.  It cannot be 
used at the same time as bite.

  Full documentation on these abilities can be found in 
     ~Terel/guilds/vamp/doc/abilities.txt


---------------
VAMPYR GUILD TAX
---------------

  The Vampyr of Terel pay a 51% tax that encompasses three guild slots:
race, lay, and occ.

  The specifics of the guild tax are still in flux pending implementation of 
mudlib changes, skills, and tweaks to the guild so the particulars of the 
taxation will not be posted until the early implementation phase has passed.

  Full documentation on the current guild tax calculations can be found at
     ~Terel/guilds/vamp/doc/occ_tax.txt
  


Tax reductions:
	
Lay:
  There is a 2% tax break for blood thirst. Members are required to drink
blood from livings, as they receive no nourishment from food or drink. If 
their blood-level drops too low they are incapacitated and can die. Blood is
also an ingredient for special abilities and tends to be used up rather 
quickly, requiring members to feed frequently. Additionally, they do not 
experience the healing benefits of intoxication, since they cannot drink
alcohol.

Occ:
  There is a 2% tax break for a sunlight penelty. The four largest domains
in Genesis use sunlight, increasing levels of it through their day cycles,
and the Vampyr receive a significant CON stat poison when in sunlight which
can also kill them if they remain in the sunlight for too long.

  Full documentation on these penelties can be found in the doc
     ~Terel/guilds/vamp/doc/penalties.txt
