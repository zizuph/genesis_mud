Description:    Magically brightens the surroundings.  This is currently
		accomplished by temporarily setting the property ROOM_I_LIGHT()
		to 2 * Effectiveness modifier, waiting the appropriate duration,
		then resetting ROOM_I_LIGHT().  Eventually this will be 
		replaced by a cloned light_obj.  Effectiveness modifier 
		is a function of the condition of the instrument 
		(or vocal chords) and whether or not the performer is part 
		of a choir.  It is expressed as a percent.
		
Duration:       60 * Effectiveness modifier.
Requirements:   SG_READ_MUSIC > 15
