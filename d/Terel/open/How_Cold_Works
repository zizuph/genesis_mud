Cold effects in Terel defines few constants:
"_obj_i_cold_weather_protects"
"_player_i_cold"
"_room_i_terel_cold"
Those were defined in /d/Terel/include/Terel.h file, do not
define them if you include that file.


To make cold protecting item:
	Simply add "_obj_i_cold_weather_protects" to it.
Seting it with postivie value will make item protect
player wearing it from cold in Terel. Notes:

- Only specialy designed items in Terel domain have
this prop set with number above 1, warm clothes should
have it set to 1, magical items, or something like that
can have it set to 2. Generally if you want to make it
higher then 1 contact me first.

- It can be set with negative value, then item will
make player get cold faster. I assume it could
fit the theme for some magic items. Please
contact me before you add something like that.
//

To make item interacting with cold directly:
	You need to modify "_player_i_cold" prop
on player. Notes:

- You have to handle all descriptions yourself.

- Use reasonable values here. Max value of that
prop is 1500 (nothing wrong will happen if it exeed this).
And while in the forest it raises by 5-10 points every
10 seconds or so.

To make cold rooom outside Terel:
	Seting "_room_i_terel_cold" prop in a room
will NOT make it a cold room. It will only cause players
with "_player_i_cold" above zero keep geting colder in
that room. It's not possible to create such room without
inheriting Terel files by now. Please contact Liege of
Terel if you desire to do so.



WARNING:
  As much as I'd like as many possible items around the
Realms to interact with Terel cold effect I will block
manually any item that does it in manner I don't
approve. Contact me if you have any doubts.
