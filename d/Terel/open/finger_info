Terel is a vast domain that runs from sea to icy mountain tops. Most 
of it is wild and untamed, with a few towns dotting the landscape.
Ancient and mystical, there are great mysteries here, some of which 
can be penetrated, some which cannot. 
   At present there are no plans to expand Terel, but rather, to work
with what is already here: repairing and improving where needed, and
excavating where possible.
   If you are interested in helping in Terel, or if you feel there are
errors or other balance-related concerns that need to be addressed, 
please use the 'terel' mail alias for a prompt response.
