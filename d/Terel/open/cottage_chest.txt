You reach out and place your hands on the black orb, while entering a state of deep concentration. 
You feel your mind escaping from your body, flowing into the black orb. 
Like stepping out of a portal, you arrive at a cottage nestled in the hills north of the moor.
Somewhere in the cottage there is a chest with a lock that must be broken -- no, melted -- in order to attain the treasures inside.
Your vision becomes blurry, and you return to your body with a jerk, instinctively removing your hands from the orb.
