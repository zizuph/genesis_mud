Nastya the Evilminded
---------------------
Nastya is a sick, twisted, dark and evil goblin, who loves to torture animals and people for the fun of it. she could be described as having an air or danger and evil about her. She also seem to plan some experiments dealing with how some animals(kittens, puppies, squirrels, smaller birds etc) reach to having light and continual light spells cast on them in various ways.

This evil npc could stand in some room in the forest and make the life a hell for the animals that walk into her room, as she blind them on sight. 

This could be some sort of quest where the mortal help the animals against the evilminded nastya, and in return
recieves a little amount of quest experience and an enchant that gives unbootable weapons a glowing enchant.
