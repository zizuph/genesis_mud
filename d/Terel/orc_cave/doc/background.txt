There is a cave that is off of the eastern border of the forest to the
north of Calathin.  An ancient red dragon that used to live in the
mystic valley northwest of the cornerstone grew very old and the
sunlight started to bother its ancient eyes, so it moved into the
dark cave.  The cave was already inhabited by a family of orcs abd a
small den of wolves.
