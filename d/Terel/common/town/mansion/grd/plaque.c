Garden of Despair
=================
In the year xxxx the witch Ulla was found gilty of practicing witchcraft. She 
was sentenced to be burned at the stake and decapitation. The sentence was 
carried out, but as the witch was placed at the stake, she uttered a curse over 
the garden, saying that this place no longer should bring happiness and joy but
instead despair and sorrow. The people at the execution laughed at the old 
and rejoiced when she burned. After the fire the head was struck of from the 
body and the executiomer started to bury the corpse, when suddenly 
the plants in the garden came alive and people fled in panic. Not until after 
several days some brave guards managed to get to the place of execution but 
they could not find any trace of the witchs corpse. Someone else must have taken
and hidden the corpse elsewere.
