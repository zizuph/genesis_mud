Ro and I were tossing around some ideas (go figure) and after that
last talk with Amelia, we were thinking specifically of a racial
guild which only occupational Kahedans could join.

This racial would include to mana-using specials which we think
would fit most definitely in with dragons: a modified mtell and
a nightvision ability.

Also, partly to help out the OCC with taxation (moving skills to the
racial), and also partly to flesh out the racial, here are some skill
suggestions:

   Spellcraft          sup jour
   Alchemy             sup jour
   Appraise Enemy      sup jour
   Appraise Object     sup jour
   Appraise Value      sup jour
   Hunting             sup jour
   Trading             sup jour

The above skills shouldn't trouble balance, though I admit the specials
might.  But it seems like a thematic way to flesh out the Guild.

Anyway... goodnight, all! :)

Take care!

D.
