Performing ritual bow from the waist, perhaps in a slightly
  different way to an opponent than to a 
  a friend, different degrees of depth depending on 'size' of target,
  perhaps with different adverbs (make description bit more dignified 
  than silly minstrels or standard bow emote)


Player closes <his/her> eyes for a moment to meditate on < object of meditation -- allow player to finish the thought >


Player goes through a sequence of martial arts moves (bit like
the Dancer's dance): need some technical help on description of the
moves tho, make them graphic and graceful...maybe more graceful
for the highly trained, and somewhat awkward and clumsy for the
initiate.
