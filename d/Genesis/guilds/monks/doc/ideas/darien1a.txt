The mail which comes next is what Ro and I came up with as a
tentative document for the new rules of the Order.  We titled
the document "The Traditions of the Ancient Order of the Dragon"
just for something to call it, btw.
We endeavoured to enrich the rules themselves with theme as well
as specifics.  If we can get 'mwarn' implemented and a system of
'Disgrace', then the rules would function the best.
Well... I'll let you read it.  Bon apetite!
