from Daisetz T. Suzuki on the school of Zen:
 
     Some think that striking is to strike:
     But striking is not to strike, nor is killing to kill.
     He who strikes and he who is struck--
     They are both no more than a dream that has 
       no reality.

     The eye sees it,
     But no hands can take hold of it--
     The moon in the stream:
     This is the secret of my school.

     Victory is for the one,
     Even before the combat,
     Who has no thought of himself,
     abiding in the no-mind-ness of great origin.

     I thought all the time 
     I was learning how to win;
     But I realize now:
     To win is no more,
     No less, than to lose.

     Inside the sacred fence before which I bow
     There must be a pond filled with clear water;
     As my mind-moon becomes bright
     I see its shadow reflected in the water.

     Into a soul absolutely free from thoughts and emotions,
     even the tiger finds no room to insert its fierce claws.
