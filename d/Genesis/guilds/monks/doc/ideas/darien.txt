Sorry, I copy-pasted that from our notes when Ro and I
were fleshing out the 'mwarn' idea, so I didn't really
make an intro to the concept.
We would like 'mwarn' to become a coded "emote" with
some very real side effects (as stated in the previous
mail) if you do not use it when attacking another player.

Obviously you wouldn't have to use mwarn when attacking
NPCs... a simple "living" check within whatever mask is
made to the kill and assist command could be added to the
guild soul.
But if someone attacked another player without mwarning
first, the circumstances would be dire.
;)
