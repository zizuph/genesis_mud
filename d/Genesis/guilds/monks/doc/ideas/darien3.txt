PUNISHMENTS

Part of what we discussed with the command mwarn was a new
level of punishment... Disgrace.  Disgrace would be a state
of punishment between Banishment and unpunished.  This would
also require a change in Banishment, so I shall explain how
these two punishments would be defined.
Disgrace will be probably the most regular level of punishment
for members.  If a member attacks another player without using
mwarn, of course, the monk will become auto-Disgraced for a
day (i.e., Darien the Disgraced Bishop of Kaheda... God help
the morality of the Order if that happened, though).  Certain
lower level offenses of the rules shall carry punishments of
Disgrace, too. Ideally, Disgrace would have the following effects:

*   the following skills would be modified downward (temporarily
    for the duration of the Disgrace) by 10 levels: focus, defense,
    unarmed, and whatever guild-trained weapon skill they have a
    specialization in (sword, polearm, or whatever else if katas
    are ultimately used)
*   dropping the guild would result in death during this period

Banishment would be redefined into the highest level of punishment
used only on lower level offenses after someone has repeatedly
broken those rules, OR on higher level offenses (attacking another
Kahedan, or something like that) from even the first offense.
Because of this extra level of transgression, Banishment would have
the following effects:

*   a member cannot use the start location of the guild
*   a member cannot go upstairs in the guild (thereby blocking
    higher level training, board-reading, and use of the drop room)
*   use of mtell (if it still exists after the recode) would be
    blocked
*   the following skills would be modified downward (temporarily
    for the duration of the Disgrace) by 20 levels: focus, defense,
    unarmed, and whatever guild-trained weapon skill they have a
    specialization in (sword, polearm, etc., as above)
*   dropping the guild would result in not only death during this
    period, but would also mean complete wiping of the guild stat
    (i.e., they would get nothing back at all from their time in
    Kaheda)

As you can see, these become some REAL harsh punishments.  Disgrace
has an 'out', though.  Obviously some attacks might have been in
truth acceptable, but they forgot to use mwarn, regardless of what
other means they might have used to alert the other person.  In a
case like this, a new Council command 'forgive' would remove the
Disgrace from the person.  Banishment, though, is un'forgive'able.
Once Banished, the member must ride out their punishment.
I would also like to have a log created for Disgraces, Banishments,
and forgives.  In cases of non-use of mwarn, the code would place
into the log an automatic message like:
   6/18/1998 02:04:32 Darien attacks Dorkboy without warning.
        Darien is Disgraced.

If I had introed and declared my attack as per the rules (and this
fact is shown by my log), then perhaps Council could 'forgive' me.
The 'forgive' command would have a comment entry, though, to show
in the log why the individual was forgiven.  For example:
   6/18/1998 08:10:13 Adriel forgives Darien because he declared
        his attack on Dorkboy.

Meanwhile, Moronboy, another member, attacks another Kahedan.  The
computer auto-Disgraces him, but he doesn't have reason for his
attack.  He ends up getting Banished for his crime.  In the code,
his Banishment would take precidence over his Disgrace, and the
Bishop banishing him would have to add a comment entry, too.  So
in this case the log might look like this:

   6/18/1998 12:48:56 Dorkboy attacks Newbiemonk without warning.
        Dorkboy is Disgraced.
   6/18/1998 13:08:03 Rowan banishes Dorkboy for attacking Newbiemonk
        a fellow Kahedan.  Sentence: 3 days banishment

Dorkboy's original one day Disgrace would be changed into three days
Banishment because Banishment has the weightier charge.  Everyone
following me?

Ok... now periods of punishment.  Here are my suggestions whereas
'B' = Banishment, 'D' = Disgrace, 'd' = day(s), 'h' = hour(s), and
'E' = Evicted from the guild:

                                              # of OFFENSES
CRIME                                     1      2      3      4
====================================     ===    ===    ===    ===
Attacking a Kahedan/spouse               3B     6B      E
Attacking a smaller player               2B     4B      E
Attacking a non-Kahedan w/o warning      1B     3B      E
Killing a Kahedan/spouse                  E
Killing a smaller non-Kahedan            3B     6B      E
Killing a non-Kahedan                    2B     4B      E
Stealing from a Kahedan                  2B     5B      E
Backstab of a Kahedan                     E
Backstab of smaller player               5D     5B      E
Ongoing slander of a Kahedan             1D     1B     3B      E
Ongoing disrespect of non-Kahedans       8hD    1D     1B      E
Stealing from smaller player             1D     3D     3B      E
Attacking guild quest NPCs               3D     3B      E

All of the above punishments are to be judged and decreed by Council
based on evidence from logs and/or eyewitness testimony.  In cases
where logs are unavailable, Council will be the final judge and jury
on their own criteria.

I would personally suggest that when selecting punishments, the
punishment be used by the number of offenses, regardless of what
came before.  Anotherwards, if someone had attacked others without
warning twice before, then kills a Kahedan, they should be evicted
from the Guild.  But if someone had attacked a Kahedan, then steals
from a Kahedan, they should not be evicted, but should get the
five days banishment.
