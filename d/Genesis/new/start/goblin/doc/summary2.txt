Overview - The goblin start location is comprised of two areas: a small
desert oasis (Ghad Mazala) and a large, underground, water-powered city
(Kalerus). Originally a natural cavern, Kalerus was carved meticulously
from the surrounding rock by early goblin settlers. An enormous
waterfall enters the cavern near the top of the north wall. The falls
create a powerful river which has been diverted through a labyrinth of
channels running throughout the city. A tribute to goblin
ingenuity, the intricate channel system supplies the city with
mechanical power as well as a continual source of fresh water for
drinking and washing. The sound of the falls creates an ever present
roar which visitors often find difficult to adjust to. Most Kalerian
natives, however, find it difficult to sleep without it. When
travelling outside the city, they are said to feel that "something is
missing."

At the south end of the cavern, all of the channelled water streams are
conscientiously rejoined into a single powerful river which exits the
cavern via a long, winding tunnel in the cavern's south wall. Some
distance from the city, the tunnel terminates as the river plunges over
a cliff in a second waterfall which disappears into a seemingly
bottomless ravine. Here the tunnel is intersected by the shaft of an
abandoned well. This is where the original settlers of the city drew
water while they were still living on the surface. Kalerians access
the rest of the world of Genesis via the water harvesting system which
was originally built to carry water from the river up the shaft to the
surface.

Visitors to Kalerus must discover the well in the middle of a harsh
desert. This is where the original settlers of Kalerus were sent after
being banished by the gods from the glorious city of Ghad Tuk. For
their misuse of certain powerful magic, the entire goblin tribe of Xi
Tpa was destroyed with the exception of six members of its leadership
council, including Tpa himself. No water was to be found in the endless
desert and, when death was upon them, Xi Voch, the reigning goblin god
took pity on The Six and guided them to a source of underground water
deep in the desert. Without their magic, they were forced to use only
their simple tools and ingenuity to construct a well and harvest the
water.

Eventually, The Six took refuge from the merciless sun in the depths of
the well where they discovered the river. They followed it through the
cramped tunnel to the cavern. Their shame ultimately turned to triumph
when they completed their worship temple and dedicated it to their
savior, Xi Voch. To this day, the use of magic by goblins is very
closely regulated by the goblins themselves as their people know all
too well the anger of the gods. 

On the surface, not far from the well, an oasis has been erected by
the Kalerians. Adventurers from far away lands make the perilous trek
through the hot desert to reach the Bazaar here at Ghad Mazala. They
are able to purchase rare and valuable artwork as well as a unique style
of body armour which glows with a mysterious luminescence. These
rarities are said to be crafted by hand in the hidden goblin city of
Kalerus. Curious visitors will discover Kalerus, just waiting to be
explored, at the bottom of the oasis' unassuming little well.

The oasis Post Office provides the native Kalerians with a means of
communicating with the outside world.

The wasteland surrounding Ghad Mazala, is harsh and unforgiving. The
sun itself beats down on weary travellers with maddening persistence.
Local animal life consists of snakes, scorpions, spiders, jack rabbits,
and, as one approaches the jagged mountains which border the desert,
the occasional coyote family may be found venturing out for food.

******************

Temple of Xi Voch - The centerpiece of Kalerus is the Temple of Xi Voch.
Aside from being the architectural crown jewel of the goblin city, The
Temple serves several other functions. As the social hub of Kalerus,
the ornate Temple provides natives as well as visitors with a place to
worship and to learn. The Temple's main room for meditation is a shrine
to the ancient goblin god, Xi Voch. Here, a towering statue of Xi Voch
gestures symbolically down to a small portion of the river which has
been routed through the Temple. It runs into the chamber and travels
down a decorative, ceremonial channel running through the center of
the room. This water is considered sacred as it is physically the
first water to reach the city from the falls and, here in the shrine,
is offered back to Xi Voch as a continuous sacrifice of gratitude.

In a smaller chamber, a shrine has been erected to honor The Six, the
founders of the goblin city. The Eyes of The Six are stored here and
have been safely protected for nearly a thousand generations.
Preserving a strong, magical link to the past, these relics have been
known to call forth the visages of The Six when prayed to by a faithful
heart. Occasionally, one of The Six may even charge such a visitor with
a quest which may involve learning more about Kalerian history and
culture or even performing heroic deeds to preserve that culture.

An adjoining library contains extensive information about the tribe of
Xi Tpa, The Six, the establishment and development of Kalerus and its
surface counterpart, Ghad Mazala. The struggles of the goblin people
living here over the years contain valuable lessons for all who take the
time to study them.

The Temple is entered from the south near the Bathing Pool via a small
antechamber which houses the goblin board and a Common Board.

******************

Bathing Pool - As much a spiritual place as it is a functional one, the
goblin bathing pool is located in the courtyard just south of the
Temple. It is fed by water from the waterfall which is channelled
around both sides of the Temple and into the pool. Those who visit
Kalerus with preconceptions of goblins as dirty, stupid creatures may
be surprised to discover that physical purification as well as
spiritual rejuvenation are so central to the goblin belief system that
they figure prominently into the architecture of the city.

******************

Training Hall & Testing Place - Located southwest of the Temple, the
Training Hall offers Kalerian natives as well as city visitors a place
to learn and improve skills that are crucial to survival and success in
the world of Genesis.

Located in a small courtyard outside the Training Hall is a narrow
sinkhole leading down into The Testing Place. This is a series of dark,
tight, intersecting tunnels where young goblins are sent to prove
themselves worthy of the responsibilities of adulthood in the Kalerian
community. The walls of the tunnels are covered with kuula: tiny,
worm-like creatures which, as a result of their ingesting certain
natural minerals from the surrounding rock, give off an eerie green
glow.

The kuula are the primary staple in the diet of the vicious chutuk:
spider-like creatures the size of a dog with tough armour plating. A
young goblin candidate who is being tested is to kill a chutuk and
bring its plating back to the Shop where it can be reworked into a
piece of body armour. The chutuk's kuula diet gives the plating its
legendary green glow, allowing the armour to serve as a light source
as well as tough protection in battle.

******************

Shop - The Shop offers many of the same items that can be found at the
oasis Bazaar. The prices tend to be better here, though, as the Shop
is primarily serving goblins.  : - )

Players who defeat a chutuk down in the Testing Place should be able
to bring the creature's armour plating here to have it made into a
wearable piece of body armour.

******************

Sleeping Cells - Sleeping Cells have been dug into the west,
south, and east walls of the cavern. The Cells vary in size and
typically have room for one to four goblins. All Cells look out over
the city with those near the top of the cavern walls providing the most
breathtaking views of the scenery below. This is where goblins awaken
when they use Kalerus as their starting location. The first thing they
see when they enter the game (either returning or as a new
character) is the grand, underground city layed out before them with
the massive waterfall cascading down behind it.
