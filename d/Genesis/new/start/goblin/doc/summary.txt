Kalerus Overview - The goblin start location is a large underground city named Kalerus. Originally a natural cavern, the 
city was carved meticulously from the surrounding rock by early goblin settlers. An enormous waterfall enters the cavern
near the top of the north wall. The falls create a powerful river which has been diverted through a labyrinth of channels
running throughout the city. A tribute to goblin ingenuity, the intricate channel system supplies the city with electrical
power as well as a continual source of fresh water for drinking and washing. The sound of the falls creates an ever present
roar which visitors often find difficult to adjust to. Most Kalerian natives, however, find it difficult to sleep without it.
When travelling outside the city, they are said to feel that "something is missing."

At the south end of the cavern, all of the channelled water streams are conscientiously rejoined into a single powerful
river which exits the cavern via a long, winding tunnel in the cavern's south wall. Some distance from the city, the tunnel
terminates as the river plunges over a cliff in a second waterfall which disappears into a seemingly bottomless ravine. Here
the tunnel is intersected by the shaft of an abandoned well. This is where the original settlers of the city drew water
while they were living on the surface. Kalerians access the rest of the world of Genesis via the water harvesting system
which was originally built to carry water from the river up the shaft to the surface.

Visitors to Kalerus must discover the well in the middle of a harsh desert. This is where the original settlers of Kalerus
were sent after being banished by the wizards from the glorious city of Ghad Tuk. For their misuse of certain powerful magic,
the entire goblin tribe of Xi T'Pa was destroyed with the exception of six members of its leadership council, including T'Pa
himself. No water was to be found in the endless desert and, when death was upon them, Xi Voch, the reigning goblin wizard
took pity on The Six and guided them to a source of underground water deep in the desert. Without their magic, they were
forced to use only their simple tools and ingenuity to construct a well and harvest the water.

Eventually, The Six took refuge from the merciless sun in the depths of the well where they discovered the river. They
followed it through the cramped tunnel to the cavern. Their shame was ultimately turned to victory when they completed their
worship temple and dedicated it to their savior, Xi Voch. To this day, the use of magic by goblins is very closely regulated
by the goblins themselves as their people know all too well the anger of the wizards. 

******************

Temple of Xi Voch - The centerpiece of Kalerus is the Temple of Xi Voch. Aside from being the architectural crown jewel of
the goblin city, The Temple serves several other functions. As the social hub of Kalerus, the ornate Temple provides natives
as well as visitors with a place to worship and to learn. The Temple's main room is a shrine to the ancient goblin wizard,
Xi Voch. Here, a towering statue of Xi Voch gestures symbolically down to a small portion of the river which has been
routed through the Temple. It runs into the chamber and travels down a decorative, ceremonial channel running through the
center of the room. This water is considered sacred as it is physically the first water to reach the city from the falls
and, here in the shrine, is offered back to Xi Voch as a continuous sacrifice of gratitude.

In a smaller chamber, a shrine has been erected to honor The Six, the founders of the goblin city. The Eyes of The Six are
stored here and have been safely protected for nearly a thousand generations. Preserving a strong, magical link to the past,
these relics have been known to call forth the visages of The Six when prayed to by a faithful heart. Occasionally, one of
The Six may even charge such a visitor with a quest which may involve learning more about Kalerian history and culture or
even performing heroic deeds to preserve that culture.

An adjoining library contains extensive information about the tribe of Xi T'Pa, The Six, the establishment and development of
Kalerus, and the struggles of the goblin people living there over the years.

The Temple is entered from the south near the Bathing Pool via a small antechamber which houses the goblin board and a
Common Board.

******************

Bathing Pool - As much a spiritual place as it is a functional one, the goblin bathing pool is located in the courtyard just
south of the Temple. It is fed by water from the waterfall which is channelled around the Temple and into the pool. Those
who visit Kalerus with preconceptions of goblins as dirty, stupid creatures may be surprised to discover that physical
purification as well as spiritual rejuvenation are so central to the goblin belief system that they figure prominently into
the architecture of the city.

******************

Training Hall & Combat Arena - Located southwest of the Temple, the training hall offers Kalerian natives as well as city
visitors a place to learn and refine skills that are crucial to survival and success in the world of Genesis.

The combat arena offers a public place for the settlement of personal and political disputes. A special water channel serves
as a moat around the combat arena and contains thousands of deadly chutuk, small, six-legged, amphibious carnivores which
can devour even a champion in a matter of moments. The moat discourages combatants from having second thoughts once they
commit to a battle, and also prevents interference from excited onlookers. It is accepted in Kalerus that if you are not
prepared to die, you do not enter the arena.

******************

Shop - The shop offers a variety of wares for reasonable prices. The management naturally caters to goblins.  : - )

Post Office - This is a standard post office.

Sleeping Cells - Hundreds of sleeping cells have been dug into the west, south, and east walls of the cavern. The cells vary
in size and typically have room for one to four goblins. All cells look out over the city with those near the top of the
cavern walls providing the most breathtaking views of the scenery below.
