SOUNDS in Genesis

General
-------
There are static sounds and there are dynamic sounds. Static
sounds are stationary and will always come from the same room. 
Dynamic sounds will be generated by a movable object. The
strength of the sound and the 'awareness' skill of the player
will control weather a specific player actually hear the sound
and how loud. Static sounds are easier to optmise than dynamic.

Static sounds
-------------
When a room is created it will register what static sounds
can be heard in it. Registration has to be done in such way
that each sound is unique through Name or ID (i.e. KRYNN + SOLACE 
+ LOUDBELL and GENESIS + HOBBITS + FAINTANVIL)

When a player enters a room s/he will register for the sounds
in that room. On exit s/he will be deregistred. Registration
could be implemented as a counting semaphore, keeping track
of many players at once.

When a sound is generated by a bell or an anvil it will only
be sent to those where one or more players are available detected 
by the player registration above.

Dynamic sounds
--------------
Any object that can be carried around can be enabled to generate 
directional sounds. 

When it generates a sound the rooms in a stright direction from
where it was generated will get notified if player(s) are there.

The sound will decay through each room depending on some 
factors i.e. indoor->outdoor, outdoor->indoor etc.

If no more room is available in a certain direction the sound 
will not travel further. The sound will not bend through corners.
