Weapons:
--------
staff of the medusa    (/d/Genesis/start/human/obj/ogre_magi_staff.c)

   Creator: Arman

      This staff has captured the spirit of a maternal medusa. In the 
      hands of a young adventurer, this staff may 'petrify' enemies 
      with a blast of earth magic. Superior amateur skill in earth 
      magic and spellcraft is required to use the magic of the staff.

      It is designed to allow new and small players to experience 
      basic magical spell items, and is restricted to those with stats 
      defined as SD_IS_NEWBIE or lower.

      'Petrify' activates an at_will_harm spell,
      /d/Genesis/start/human/obj/ogre_magi_staff_spell.c, and if an
      enemy's death is caused by petrify a unique death corpse is
      created through /d/Genesis/start/human/obj/petrify_corpse_sh.c

      Petrify requires SS_SPELLCRAFT and SS_ELEMENT_EARTH to be of
      skill level 20 (superior amateur) to activate.

      Wielded by: ogre magi (/d/Genesis/start/human/obj/ogre_mage.c) 

      (Values: hit 30, pen 20). It is a two handed W_POLEARM weapon.
