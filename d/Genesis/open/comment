This is a very long note that comments on Dworkins note. I have studied
copyright laws as they are valid both in a Swedish environment, and in an
international one. The length is due to the fact that Dworkin raises several
interesting points that deserve comment.

- First of all this notice is invalid. To be valid it must contain the
word Copyright (or the copyright symbol), year and place of publication
and your name. Your alias here will not do.
- Second, copyright law is dispositive, meaning that you as the author have
the right to make agreements that change the legal status of your material.
When you have agreed to the terms in the published notice, those are the
terms that are valid.

>   The license itself I consider no more than a makeshift declaration of
>intentions, as it is riddled with ambiguities, and last but not least gives
>CD the right to do anything, anything at all, with your code.  

- This is totally untrue. CD can't sell your code, use it for commercial
purposes and can't give it away for commercial use. Neither can anyone else.
The entire copyright notice is there to make sure that noone invokes the
legal system unless there has been a major infringement of his/her rights.
The licence is actually an improvement over the way things have worked
before, when anyone could have taken your code for any purpose. I won't go
into detail on how and why, but it is certainly the case. 

>There are many limitations for wizards, but the rules of conduct for 
>arches and keepers are not clearly stated anywhere.  

- This is a valid point and we will add to the ethics section to cover the 
subject.

- Let's just say that someone in Australia copies code made by an American from
our machine in Sweden to a machine in Switzerland, and the American gets mad
and wants to sue. Try to figure out where the case should be settled, which
laws that apply and a plethora of other things that present laws don't cover.

>F2.  Then again, there are files that are the result of the efford of just
>     a single person.  Why do others need to have any right to it?

- Because the works that are results of collective endeavour are in majority,
and it would be extremely cumbersome to have different rules applying to
different pieces of code. We are in this for the fun of mudding, not to
spend our time on legalese matters.

>F9.  The copyright notice gives CD the right to edit, remove, copy and
>     distribute my code.  What rights do I still have?

- Mainly the right to be known as the author of the code. What other rights
do you really need?

- As all copyright notices, this one assumes that it pertains to the code
mentioned in the notice. It also assumes that the code is written by its
author. All other parties involved are defined in the notice. To make the
notice apply to your code, we have to ask you and you have to agree that
it does. In Sweden your word is as good as your signature, so no paperwork is
needed.

>C2.  I think a specific copyright statement in a file would override this
>     license, or any license.

- No, your agreements overide your rights under the copyright law.

- In legal terms, yes. But the rules and morals of a society are more than
just the law. I find it extremely silly to bring lawyers and courts into
disputes over something that is a hobby. We should be able to handle all
such matters within our own rules, and the rules clearly state that we
do not accept copying of other peoples code without their consent.
(If they can be reached, if they can't we leave it to the judgement of a
keeper.)

- I can't give you a direct quote, because it is extremely difficult to
translate Swedish legalese into English without bending the meaning of things.
The law is called 'Lagen om upphovsmannar{tt' and was, if my memory serves
me right, established in it's present form in 1967, with an amendment covering
program executables made last year.
The first sentence of the paragraph says that any disputes over code should be
settled in a Swedish court, under the Swedish legal system.
The second sentence simply informs people about a fact of Swedish copyright
law that is different from most other countries. This fact has the plesant
side effect that we don't have to put a copyright notice in every piece of
code we write. It also puts the responsibility of finding out what the
licensing terms for the code are on the person copying or using the code.

>E4.  And keepers - they ask themselves for permission?

- You have to trust the keepers to handle your character and your code in a
fair manner. If the keepers are not trustworthy, you should keep all code you 
have an emmotional investment in away from the mud.
- I do agree that the point isn't mentioned in the ethics, and we will add
something about it. The rule of thumb is that if a wizard hasn't been seen
for a couple of months, anything pertaining to his code will be taken care
of by a keeper.

>E13. First, this article talks about rights: why is it with the Ethics?

- This is a 'just-so-you-know-it' clause. It doesn't affect the legal status 
of anything. CD is a democratic organization with a board and with member
meetings where important things are decided. The board, the meetings and the
game admins can all make decisions that affect the mud. Individual members
do not have any power over it. Removing the paragraph wouldn't change
anything, except making people mentally less prepared the day when a
change comes. 

- Finally there is one thing I am prepared to change in the copyright notice.
I am prepared to include a paragraph where it says that authors can make
their code public domain by explicitly saying so. The material can then be 
used by anyone for any purpose. It is something that gives people a choice
without changing the status of Genesis.
Sorry about the lenght of this, but I thought Dworkins reflections were
very relevant and deserved full answers.
