The liege council
=================
The liege council is a formal body consisting of all the current
lieges. Its function is to be a forum for decisions in matters given
to the lieges to decide upon, to work as the major forum for
interdomain cooperation and to act as an advisary to the
administration.
Lieges of open domains have one vote in council meetings, all other
lieges have one half vote.
If a liege is unable to attend a meeting, he/she is allowed to send a
representative from the domain. This representative is not allowed to
vote.

The speaker
===========
The council is headed by a speaker, elected among and by the
lieges. The duty of the speaker is to
- Call and hold meetings at regular intervals
- Call and hold meetings at the request of at least 1/3 of the lieges
  or at the request of an archwizard.
- Regulate speaking order at the meetings. The speaker may, unless the
  meeting decides otherwise, limit the right to speak for any attendee
  (including archwizards).
- Speak for the domains in admin matters. For this purpose the speaker
  will be invited to non-closed parts of archwizard meetings.

A new speaker should be elected if at least half of the lieges request
so, if the speaker has been idle for over one month, or if the
archwizard council requests so.

Powers
======
The council makes binding decisions in interdomain matters and may,
with the consent of the arch-of-balance, make decisions in balance
matters. 

Advisory functions
==================
The council is expected to advise the administration or individual
arches of its opinion on current matters.

Announcements
=============
Meetings should be called by posting on the board in the house of
lords. Matters to be discussed should if possible be announced before
the meeting, to give people not being able to attend a chance to post
or mail their views on a subject.
When matters falling into the field of an archwizard are to be
discussed, this person should be invited. Archwizards may at their
discretion attend any liege council meeting.

What has been said herein about archwizards applies also to keepers.
