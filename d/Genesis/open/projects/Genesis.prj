The Genesis domain hosts Sparkle and the racial start locations 
and contains a fair bit of the game's basic code. There won't usually 
be many wizards in this domain apart from those who wish to rewrite 
or update the start locations or mess with old code. There's little 
room for new innovations even though the possibility of enlarging 
the domain does exist in a limited fashion. 
The name Genesis itself stands for the entire MUD of course, which 
is situated on a giant donut.
