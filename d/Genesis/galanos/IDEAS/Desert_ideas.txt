Desert Ideas

1.	As in a real desert one can't travel very long in the midday due to
	the danger of heatstroke. Plus, can you imagine trying to walk 
	through a desert in armour? It's unrealistic, so I propose either
	making it harder to walk through the rooms, hence people tire quicker,
	or, perhaps making the players thirst an issue of survival.

2.	Also with a desert environment, cities or villages would probably be
	active at different times compared to a normal city or village. Hence
	the idea of having "Night markets" so that people could buy stuff at
	obscure times of the day.

3.	Another concept that would go quite well, would be having a shopkeeper
	in town that sells a salve (sunscreen) that would protect you from the
	effects of the sun beating down on your skin. Those who aren't wearing
	armor or this salve might end up getting a sunburn. We could query the
	skin_type, and those with darker skin wouldn't burn, but they might
	get hotter/thirstier quicker?

4.	Another hazard of being in the desert, especially when you're tired and
	hot is dealing with mirages. Perhaps to correspond with #1, the players
	warning signal is he starts hallucinating.
