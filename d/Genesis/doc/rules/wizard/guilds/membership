HEADER Membership rules and management

Entering:

  The guild can choose to accept or deny any player for any reason.
  However, there should be formalised guidelines. Individual players
  may be denied by a council if one is created, but wizards may never
  accept or deny at a personal level. Otherwise, the accept/deny rules
  should be put into code. You may for instance disallow people with
  certain styles of guilds, certain alignment requirements, whatever,
  but you should be very careful with disallowing specificly named
  other guilds.

Leaving:

  The punishment for leaving a guild can be anything, even death, AS
  LONG AS the player is informed of this BEFORE he joins the
  guild. The punishment for leaving a major guild should be very
  strict. For minor guilds it should be very small, maybe even none.

Expelling:

  If a guild wants to be able to remove members from the guild, for
  example in case they break guild rules, the removal may not be
  executed by a wizard. It has to be coded so that it either happens
  automatically or that it is decided and executed by mortals.

Council:

  If a guild has a council, then the procedures for joining and leaving
  the council (voting, appointment or otherwise) must be embedded in the
  code. In order for a council to function, its members should be active.
  There must be a way for the guild to remove idle members from the
  council. This can be either automatically based on certain parameters
  or through an action of one or more members (but not require wizards).

  In general, it is encouraged for a guild to have a mechanism through which
  members can remove a council member they feel should not be in the council
  (due to idleness, abuse of power, killing someone or otherwise).
