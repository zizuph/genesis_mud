HEADER Guild stats

Each type of guild is given a stat in the player. As all stats it is
governed by how much experience the player gains. Each time the player
gains experience %tax of it will end up in the guilds stat.

For normal stats, players can set the %pref values. For the guild stat
this % value is the guild tax. This also means that if a player has
joined a guild, then he can not set his learn prefs to more than 100 -
%tax.

It is up to the guild to supply an interpretation of the guild
stat. Some might choose not to do this and that is quite ok. The main
purpose is to tax the players for joining a guild. It is of course
more entertaining if the guild stat actually means something.

If a player joins or leaves a guild, the guild stat can be reset to 1
(Use 'clear_guild_stat()').

If you want one or more variables in the player measuring some
prestige or other advancement in the guild, this is easily solved
using the skills mechanism. Skills are in effect extra identifiable
variables stored in the player. You do not of course have to display
the value as a skill.
