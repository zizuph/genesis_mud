HEADER Definition of

An adventurers guild or open guild is considered to be any form of
skill training that is not in a major guild as described in these
texts. It may be a room in a town, a travelling lore-master or
something else. These open training facilities may only train the
skills listed in 'man skills' and to the maximum listed in that
same manual.

Guilds that you cannot join (read: rooms like the Adventurers Guild)
may not offer more than a total education of 250 skill levels.
