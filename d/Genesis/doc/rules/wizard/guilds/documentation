HEADER What to document, where to put it

All guilds must be described in files in the '/d/<domain>/open/GUILDS'
directory. The documentation should include the calculation of the
tax (how much tax for the skills that are trained, how much tax for
extra abilities or benefits, how much tax for combat aid, how is the
comabt aid estimated). It should also describe all special guild
skills, all extra abilities and benefits and list the
guildmaster(s). See the manual 'domain_info' for details.

In the same directory you should put a file for each adventurers guild
in your domain. It should contain a list of all skills that are taught
in the guild, the maxima to which those skills are taught, the cost if
that is different from the default price, the path to the guild and
any other special information worth of including.
