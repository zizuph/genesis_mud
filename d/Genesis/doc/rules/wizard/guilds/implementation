HEADER Mudlib support for guild implementation

Basically guilds are coded with auto loading shadows. Shadows are
pieces of code that are added to the object in runtime and replace the
original objects functions. So if a shadow defines 'query_title' and
it shadows a player, then when 'query_title' is called in the player,
it gets called in the shadow instead. There is a number of functions
that a shadow can not define, these are the functions defined 'nomask'
in the object that is to be shadowed. Functions like 'query_wiz_level()'
for example :-)

There are some examples in the /doc/examples/guild/ directory.

To implement the 'tax', you must set the corresponding guild pref,
much like the learn prefs. When a player joins the guild a starting
value will be set according to the 'query_tax()' function. If you want
to change the tax the player pays later, you must call
'set_guild_pref()' in the player. When you do stat on a player you will
see what tax he pays to different types of guilds.
