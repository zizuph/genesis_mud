HEADER Permissable skills and levels

  The selection of skills available in a guild naturally depends on 
  the type and the style of the guild. The style of the guild has to 
  be clearly defined and must be limited to one profession. So for 
  example a fighter-cleric guild will not be accepted. 

  However, one could for example create a guild which is an 
  occupational fighter guild and a layman cleric guild, occupying two 
  guild slots instead of one, where it is impossible to join only one 
  branch.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SKILL TYPES
  The type of skills a guild can train without skill cap penalty as 
  an alien skill are referred to here as as 'primary' skills, and 
  is determined by guild class.

*** While SS_BACKSTAB is a mudlib skill for the purposes of taxation 
  it is considered in the same way as a 'special skill', with its 
  combat aid taxed as outlined in the standardised backstab special 
  /d/Genesis/specials/std/backstab.c. While skill points do
  not count towards a guild's skill maximum, layman guilds should
  not offer more than 60 levels in this skill and make sure backstab
  is counted towards their combat aid cap.

  Occupational Rogue classes (thief/ranger) have a bit more 
  flexibility in accessing alien skills due to the utility importance 
  of combat and magic skills in Genesis. They can train 'secondary' 
  skills up to a maximum without a penalty counting towards their 
  total skill points:

GUILD SKILL LIMITS
  A minor guild should not offer any skills at all. They are simply 
  not intended to provide anything more than a bit of feeling in the 
  game.

  As for the major guilds, the limits should be set like this:

Occupational (550 taxable slots):

  The maximum amount of skills such a guild can offer is 550 taxable
  slots. In other words, only skill levels which exceed the maximum
  listed in 'man skills' are counted towards this maximum. All
  non-taxable skills fall under the restrictions of the adventurer
  guild maximum.

  The maximum teaching level in mudlib defined skills is 90. Higher
  levels can only be taught after a difficult quest has been completed.

Layman (350 taxable slots):

  The maximum amount of skills a layman guild can offer is limited to
  350 taxable slots. In other words, only skill levels which exceed
  the maximum listed in 'man skills' are counted towards this
  maximum. All non-taxable skills fall under the restrictions of the
  adventurer guild maximum.

  The maximum teaching level for mudlib defined skills is 60 for those
  skills cost multipliers are 1.0 or less.  Skills that have a
  multiplier (such as SS_WEP_SWORD) over the 1.0 multiplier can not be
  trained above the 50 level.

Race (150 taxable slots):

  The selection of skills should reflect the advantages of the race (a
  gnome guild would probably offer trading), while excluding skills
  that the race would never bother with (no hobbit guild should train
  swimming).

  Guild specific skills may not give aid in combat. The guild may not
  train specialised fighting skills as defined in /sys/ss_types.h.

  The maximum amount of skills a racial guild can offer is limited to
  150 taxable slots. In other words, only skill levels which exceed
  the maximum listed in 'man skills' are counted towards this maximum.
  All non-taxable skills fall under the restrictions of the adventurer
  guild maximum.

  The maximum teaching level for mudlib defined skills is 50, with the
  exception of general skills, they can be trained to 60, *only* if
  the alien skill penalty is applied to them.  So a guild offering 60
  SS_SWIM would use up ((60 - 30) * 2) 60 taxable skill slots.

General:

  Each guild can define guild specific skills if appropriate. So a
  dwarf race guild might teach 'mine craft', and a fighter guild will
  probably train a special kind of attack or defence. However, think
  carefully in advance before defining a skill that maybe never will
  be used. Remember to choose skills defined by the mudlib (see
  /sys/ss_types.h), select from those according to type and style of
  your guild.

  Guild specific skills may be trained to a maximum level of 100. They
  are not counted towards the maximum skill levels for the guild.

  Skills which are alien to the guild style should be offered only in
  a very limited way. So for example a thief guild might offer defence
  or parry up to level 30, or a fighter guild could offer two magic
  skills up to level 20. Skills alien to the guild style count twice
  towards the sum of levels which the guild may offer *above* the
  limits in 'man skills' (you do not apply this penalty to the
  taxation of the skills which are alien... the 2x penalty is applied
  towards the total skill cap).

  For rogue class skills (those that are a 'thief/ranger' or 'thief 
  only' primary skill) only half of the skill levels count towards 
  an occupational thief/ranger guild skill cap (so for 80 points of 
  pick pockets, only 40 would count towards the 550 cap).

  Further, to support the 'jack of all trade' philosophy of the
  ranger class only half of the points from 'general' skills count
  towards a ranger's skill maximum cap.


Layman branches of occupational guilds:

  If a guild has both an occupational and a layman branch, the
  following has to be taken into consideration. As described elsewhere
  the layman guild is the every man version of the occupational guild,
  which is the professional part. Layman members may train the same
  skills and abilities as the occupational part of the guild.
  However, they may not be able to be as good as those whose primary
  profession it is.

  There is one standard rule:

    The average effective ability of layman members may (per ability)
    not exceed 60 per cent of the average effective ability of the
    occupational members (in that ability).

  In simpler words this means that if you have an attack that does 100
  damage each 10 rounds, the layman version may be 60 damage each 10
  rounds or 100 damage each 16.7 rounds. This rule does not only apply
  to special attacks, but also to other major guild-abilities,
  whichever form they take.

  How this is implemented, is up to the guild master. It may be in the
  formulae used or in the maximum skills trainable. Remember, however,
  that if you limit the training facility to layman members, you must
  reduce the skills in the player if he leaves the occupational branch
  for the layman branch. If the player later re-joins occupational,
  (s)he has to re-train the skills.
