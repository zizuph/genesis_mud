The Player Arch

Formal definition
-----------------

The player Arch primarily is involved with helping players with
problems in the game. He should also listen to whatever suggestions
they might have for improving the game and bring that to the attention
of the AoB or LC (perhaps even individual Wizards) as appropriate.

Another important task for the player Arch is naturally to catch those
misguided players (and Wizards) who insist on cheating. Unfortunate as
it is, we need some form of control. In this area the AoP might make
recommendations of code modifications to both the AoM as well as
individual Wizards. This could possibly be a separate Arch position
where the AoP is a helper to this position and this Arch is a helper
to the AoP position. That way they could spend energy where it's
needed while still keeping the mud reasonably well covered.

The creation of a second player Arch position should be left to the
administration just as with the second Keeper position. Initially we
should start out with just one.

Amendments
----------

As of right now the AoP takes care of all cheat-hunting, including
that of wizards helping mortals to cheat. However, any disciplining
of wizards is the AoD's domain, the AoP handles the mortals only
even if it might be likely that a cheating wizard soon falls under
the jurisdiction of the AoP anyway :)
