The Balance Arch

Formal definition
-----------------

This Arch handles game balance. This is a very tricky job since he is
deeply involved with the domain Lords and Wizards, often making
comments on sensitive subjects. He makes sure the domains are
following the rules that adher to the concept of balance and suggests
such changes as might be necessary in order to make things work _even
if_ they are not written down as actual rules or perhaps even
contradicts written ones. He must be given vast freedom of action,
even though he naturally is expected to be able to motivate his
decisions at all times.

His position also affects that of several other Arches in the game,
primarily the AoM and the Domain Arch (AoD). A closer level of co-
operation is therefore needed here to make things run without
friction.

Amendments
----------

Well, not much more to be added here really. Questions in regard to
balance goes to the Balance Arch. In those cases where he needs to
have game policy changed he goes to the Keeper, where it touches on
the mudlib to the Mudlib Arch and if he gets into actual domain-
specific questions the Domain Arch. All pretty straight forward.
