This is Genesis game policy in regard to domains
------------------------------------------------

In a domain the Lord is the formal leader. He decides how the domain is
run and what kind of work goes on there. Naturally he will listen to the
wizards who work there since it's they who do most of the work as they
usually outnumber him by a big factor.

The Lord is responsible for the code his wizards produce. In other words
it's he who will take both official credit and blame for good or bad code
in the domain as the representative for the domain. Due to this situation
it's his duty to make sure that any released code works and is balanced
in regard to the rest of the game.

The Lord may open most code when he considers it ready but there are some
special cases where permission and/or notification of the relevant Arches
is required. In the case of guilds and ultimate level quests the Lord 
requires permission from the AoB prior to opening. When significant new 
areas are opened that do not include guilds or ultimate level quests, the 
Lord should nevertheless inform the AoD and AoB of their opening. For 
other code, the Lord needs no special permission to open, but the AoD 
and particulary the AoB might have opinions on it later.
