The world of Genesis
====================

The world of Genesis is a toroid, shaped like a donut. The sun is
places in the middle of the toroid and the toroid rotates around the
sun. This makes for a number of interesting features.

One must assume that the sun really remains centrally positioned, or
the orbit of the toroid will soon decline and the sun will intersect
with a lot of unpleasant consequences. Not nice.

This means that there are no seasons, no days and nights. The hottest
place on Genesis is along the inner band, closest to the sun. The
light-level will decrease as you walk outwards around the toroid.
When you reach the "top" you will have twilight and finally see the
stars. As you continue around you will come to a land of perpetual
darkness and cold.

Ordinary compassess really are of little use here, but the toroid does
revolve around the sun, causing a nice magnectial flow inside the
toroid. Think about it and you can probably device a nice way for
people to find out where they are. Perhaps brushing up your knowledge
in electro-magnetical field theory will help :)

There is an actual map of Genesis in the game. Players can walk in that
map and hopefully you will link your rooms to the map so that people
can enter them. Right now there are about 29160000 different locations
in the map for people to get lost in. Styles is busy writing more.

Technology, sociology
=====================

The game is set in "the long distant past". Because of this all
descriptions and messages of _any_ kind in the game should give the
player the feeling of a medieval setting. There simply may not exist
anything that even remotely sounds modern, not even in places where a
mortal never may see it.

Implementing your ideas in Genesis
==================================

Anything you write must fit into the world of Genesis. We will not accept
"portals", "black holes" or any such stuff as an excuse for creating a
world that does have seasons, day/night, science-fiction elements etc.
Nothing like that. 

Either you write stuff that fit here, or you're free to ftp home the
mud source from alcazar.cd.chalmers.se (129.16.79.30) and write your
own world there.

This might sound harsh but we think it is important for the feeling of
the game that things are based around a common theme. So, please go
along with our wishes in this.

Domains
=======

Writing code is all done within an organisation of domains. A domain
is simply a group of wizards working on a common project. A domain is
headed by a Lord, one of the wizards, who have the titulary responsablity 
of what is produced of the domain. He also is the one who has the power
to add/remove members in the domain.

So, either you join an existing domain or you write up a suggestion of
a new domain and send it to Fatty for evaluation. If he likes it he will
appoint you Lord over the domain, provided that you have at least two
other wizards willing to work with you. A domain may not be started with
less than three members.

When the domain is finished, the code written, the idea exhausted and
the bugs corrected (last but not least) you can leave the domain and
start/join a new one. The code will remain in the game for mortals to
use even though there are no members of the domain any more.

Legends & lore
==============

In the morning of the Universe The Creator was standing in Her kitchen
beyond the Galaxies baking doughnuts. They were the best of doughnuts,
warm with lots of sugar, jam and icing. The purpose for which The
Creator baked the doughnuts has been lost in the Eons of time, but most
propably she was going to invite her neighbour Creators to tea.

The Creator had an extremely ugly and greedy little errand boy called
Fatty who had the job of ordering the galaxies, polishing the stars and
other simple tasks. Even though he was ugly and greedy he worked hard
because he knew that he wouldn't get any supper in the Evening of Time
if the job wasn't finished.

So on this very fine Morning of the Universe Fatty went to the cleaning
cabinet in the kitchen of The Creator to get more Starbrite Polish for
Stars and other Celestial Bodies. When he was done in the cleaning
cabinet The Creator had finished baking and left the kitchen. Fatty in
his greed saw the doughnuts and decided to steal them all. If he had just
taken one the whole thing would propably have gone unnoticed, but no,
he had to have them all.

Burdened with the doughnuts, as well as with a small ammount of guilt,
he ran out in the universe to hide and to devour his spoils. The running
however made him very hungry and he stopped, right in the middle of the
Milky Way, and started to wolf down the doughnuts, shoving two and sometimes
even three into his mouth at a time.

At exactly that moment The Creator discovered the theft and her rage shook
the entire galaxy, from the smallest tachyon to the largest of the
galaxy hordes. Fatty who was about to push the last doughnut into his
face managed to drop it right down on the Milky Way.

The doughnut, being round in its character started to roll along the Milky Way,
picking up speed as it rolled past all the little stars and planets.
All ways must come to an end and so does the Milky Way so the doughnut rolled
off right out into the void.

Fatty in turn rushed after the lost food and in his greed and anxiousness
to pick up with the doughnut he stumbled. Fatty, being round in his nature,
also started to roll and went after the doughnut into the void.

The Creator, who by now was less than satisfied with her morning and the
turn of events recreated herself at the end of the Milky Way and looked
sternly into the void.

"You have annoyed me beyond belief and I will punish you for your impunity" her
voice boomed. "You will forever, or until I change my mind, walk the surface
of this my last pastry. There you can spend your days mingling with that
which grows on stale bread. To light your way you will have the bottle
of Starbrite suspended in the middle of the ring."

"My final curse for you is that since you will never be able to eat this
last doughnut you will always go hungry no matter how much you eat" The
Creator finished and turned home to cancel the invitations.

And so it came to pass that the galaxies went unordered and the stars 
unpolished. Fatty walked the surface of Genesis for a long time eating 
directly from the ground in his attempt to satiate his hunger, but as time 
passed the jam separated and became water and soil. The sugar rechrystallized 
into all sorts of minerals and the icing turned to snow and ice. In short
the doughnut turned stale, and as everyone knows, all sorts of things grow
in stale bread. And so the world of Genesis became populated.
