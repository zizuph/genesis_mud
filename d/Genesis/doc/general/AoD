The Domain Arch

Formal definition
-----------------

The domain Arch is responsible for the creation of new domains,
managing of old closed domains and above all, to handle communication
between the domains and the admin. He will work closely with the LC
and listen to their suggestions as well as trying to impress on them
the reasons why certain rules and decisions must be upheld even though
they might be contradictory to general LC opinion. He does not
intervene with the Speaker of the LCs (SLC) right to talk to whoever
in the administration he wishes but it will certainly be he who
handles most questions and requests simply because it's his job to
interact with the domains.

Amendments
----------

The Domain Arch also handles wizard creation/destruction/rewarding and
disciplining. In other words, he promotes new wizards, he removes old
and promotes/demotes lords/mages as is necessary. Don't do that yourself
but send recommendations to the AoD instead.
