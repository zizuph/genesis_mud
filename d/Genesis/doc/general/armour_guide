======           A guide to medieval armours from Europe           ======

Here follows several tables of standard armours. The armours are divided 
into three sections, body armour, helmets and shields.  

Note that other armour types than those given are provided for. However, 
in no case does wearing this armour provide direct protection. These are 
allowed to give the protection in terms of magical bonuses to armour.  
For example, a ring or cloak of protection may be created this way.  


ARMOUR WEIGHTS

The weights listed in the body armour tables are for a whole suit of that 
type. The recommended multiplicative factors for the armor types listed are:

        A_TORSO    0.4
        A_LEGS     0.3
        A_R_ARM    0.1
        A_L_ARM    0.1
        A_HEAD     0.1
        A_SHIELD   0.2
        A_ROBE     0.2


BODY ARMOUR

Body armour may use the types:  A_TORSO, A_L_ARM, A_R_ARM, A_ARMS, A_L_LEG, 
A_R_LEG, and A_LEGS.  It is recommended that the construction type provided 
in the table be put into the long or the short description.  

The following table shows the main types of body armour used throughout the 
ages, along with materials, armour class, modifiers, and weights:

plate              40 (0,0,0)      24.0 kg   larger pieces of metal

Note.  Platemail has been deliberately omitted.  This is due to the fact
that platemail usually implies breastplate over chainmail, which would
be represented by A_TORSO being 40, with the other armour types being 20.


HELMETS

The following list of helmets was constructed from the body armour list,
deleting helmet types which don't really make sense.  Furthermore, the
scores were all reduced to represent the relative vulnerability of the
head.

Helmets use the A_HEAD armour slot.

SHIELDS

There are three basic types of shield. The small shield is typified by the 
buckler.  It simply protects the arm it is on. The medium shield is typified 
by the kite shield.  This gives protection to the torso as well as the arm.
Finally, the pavise was a footmans shield, meant to cover the soldier from 
archery fire.  This shield provides some coverage to the legs as well.  We 
will say, for hand-to-hand combat, that only the leg on the side of the 
shield is protected.

Shields use the A_SHIELD armour slot.

canvas                 2 (-1,0,+1)     1.0 kg   canvas stretched over a frame.
soft leather           5 (0,0,0)       1.5 kg   same, but hide or leather 
rigid leather plate    8 (0,+1,-1)     1.5 kg   hardened leather over frame

metal                 20 (0,0,0)       3.0 kg   thin metal plate over a frame
thick metal           25 (0,0,0)       5.0 kg   _very_ heavy

Until we have a system for protecting more areas of the body, we will
give a shield +5 if it is large, normal if it is medium, and -5 for a
buckler (soft leather and canvas bucklers aren't too practical...)
Large shield is double weight, small shield is half.
