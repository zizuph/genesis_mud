DOMAIN STATUS
=============

For the purposes of communication and administration, domains are labelled
with a status that is a reflection of domain activity, goals, and focus.
As activities and goals change, so may domain status.

A domain has one of the following statuses:

- Active     - a domain which focuses on the creation of new areas, while
               occasionally recoding old ones. It is in some way open to
               mortals.

- Closed     - a domain which has been discarded.

- Closing    - a domain which focuses on the transfer of important code to
               other domains and on rendering its own code unnecessary to other
               domains, with a stated goal of becoming closed. 

- Limbo      - a domain which, for one reason or another, has an uncertain 
               present and future. No new code may be opened.

- Maintained - a domain which focuses on the recoding of old areas, and the
               updating of older areas when required by mudlib changes. New
               areas are occasionally opened.

- Opening    - a domain which focuses on the creation of new areas and updating
               older areas when required by mudlib changes. It is not open to 
               mortals.

It is important to note that the term "frozen" is not used anywhere. Frozen
means different things to different people, and it is the source of much 
confusion and misunderstanding. Please do not use it.
