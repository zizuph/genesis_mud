DOMAIN INFORMATION
==================

Every Genesis Domain is required to make and maintain certain information
files. These files should be structured in such a way as to make it possible
to find the desired information in the minimum amount of time. They are
invaluable to the Administration when dealing with bugs that need fixing
when no Domain wizards are logged in. Additionally, these files provide
interested people with insight into the Domain's theme and projects.

Most domain information must be put within the /d/Domain/open/ hierarchy 
so that everyone has read access. However, common security concerns about 
certain categories of information mean that they needn't all be placed where 
everyone can read them i.e. you may move certain categories into other 
common directories such as /d/Domain/private/ or /d/Domain/info/. 
This document will tell you what should go where and what may go elsewhere. 
In the event that you choose to move domain information always remember to 
leave a clear pointer to its new location. 

The required files are:

ADV_GUILDS    /d/Domain/open/ADV_GUILDS
     This file should give details of the adventurer guilds in your 
     domain. For each one you should give the room path, the skills  
     taught, the levels to which they can be trained and the total 
     of all levels taught.

AUTOLOADING    /d/Domain/open/AUTOLOADING
     This file should give details of all autoloading objects in your 
     domain which may have to be restored when players lose their 
     inventories due to bugs. They might for instance be quest rewards 
     or special guild items. Details should include the path, how they 
     are obtained, any special features they offer the owner and any 
     special information about restoration. Usually it is preferable for 
     the domain offering such objects to provide a means for players to 
     restore themselves, thus saving time and effort for others. 
     Since this info may possibly give away quest details, you may move
     it elsewhere. 

BITS           /d/Domain/open/BITS
     This file should contain a table with three columns: the bit numbers, 
     the experience (if it is a quest) and a very brief description of 
     what the bit is used for.  If quests are binary coded, please explain 
     the levels in the binary coding.  Since this doc is for bit-listing, 
     do -not- add long quest descriptions here.  Those should be in the 
     QUESTS directory.  The ideal BITS file should have -one- line per bit.

GUILDS         /d/Domain/open/GUILDS/<guild>
     This directory should have individual files for each major and minor 
     guild in the Domain.  Each file should contain a paragraph of back-
     ground information which describes the Guild and how it fits into the 
     Domain's theme.  The pathnames for the soul, shadow, joinroom, guild 
     object(s) and other important files should be listed, as well as the 
     computation summary of the Guilds' tax (with skills, specials, and spells 
     accounted for).  See /doc/man/general/guilds for additional require-
     ments.  More indepth information is desirable, but not mandatory, 
     and may be placed in a different directory if privacy or secrecy is
     considered a necessity.

MAGIC          /d/Domain/open/MAGIC 
     This file should list -every- magical object in the Domain that is
     available to mortals.  If the file becomes very large, you may make
     this a directory with individual files for armours, weapons, and
     others.  The following should be listed in some form: object's short
     description, path, coder, place to which it is cloned, magic type, 
     magical properties, skill and/or stat enhancements, type (if weapon 
     or armour), class (AC, WC), obtainability, special effects, and any
     other pertinent information.  Lack of documentation of a Magical 
     Object is a disciplinary offense.  This information may be moved 
     elsewhere. 

QUESTS         /d/Domain/QUESTS/<quest>
     These files should contain a (brief) description of the quest and
     the experience that is given for the quest. It would be nice to
     add the creator of the quest for reference. You may include the 
     solution, but that is not mandatory. Since it is not mandatory you 
     may of course put it in the domain's private directory if you want 
     it present but with extra security. Adding pathnames is very helpful, 
     but is not mandatory either.  

README         /d/Domain/open/README
     Originally intended as an 'advertisement' file for attracting new
     wizards, this file has evolved into a brief statement of a Domain's
     theme and projects.  README's intended audience is primarily people 
     outside the Domain, but it should also be useful to Domain wizards 
     in determining the thematic relevance of possible projects.  You 
     may divide the information contained in this file however you like, 
     even going so far as to create other files such as Projects, Theme, 
     History, or what have you--just so long as somewhere in the Domain's
     open directory there is information regarding the Theme as well as
     current and future projects.  

SPELLS         /d/Domain/open/SPELLS/<spell>
     Each spell your domain offers should be described here in a file.
     You should include what it does if you cast the spell and what the
     casting requirements are (mana cost, skills, etc).  List the path-
     name of the object and the ingredients.  Add chances of success or 
     failure and perhaps the name of the creator. (See 'man spell_form' 
     for more information.) This information may be moved elsewhere. 

SHIPLINES      /d/Domain/open/SHIPLINES
     Shiplines have almost always been a problem, especially newly created
     or modified ones.  With this in mind, as well as the probability that
     eventually some of the Domains in Genesis will be 'frozen', it would
     be best for Domains to list all of their shiplines.  Please take the 
     time to list the path, ship name/designation, captain, start location, 
     destination, and cost of all shiplines that originate in your Domain.
     (See /d/Avenir/open/SHIPLINES for an example).  Listing the shiplines
     which visit your Domain from other Domains is helpful, but not man-
     datory, since it (should be) redundant.

SHOPS          /d/Domain/open/SHOPS
     List here all of the shops, pubs and inns within the Domain.  This
     includes every object that sells/buys stuff or handles money like 
     a shop, such as travelling salesmen. The name, path, and what is 
     sold or bought is desired. 

SKILLS        /d/Domain/open/SKILLS 
     This file should give details of all skills that are specific to your 
     domain, for instance special guild skills. You should group then under
     appropriate headings and list their define names with their skill 
     numbers. 


Lieges are responsible for keeping these files current, but since no one
is omnipotent, do make sure that your wizards also know these files, and 
see to it that they inform you or make the necessary changes to the docs 
themselves.
