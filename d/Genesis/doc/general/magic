                            ============

Magic is by the common man viewed as something complicated beyond belief.
He is led into these beliefs by the vast number of arcane ways that
magicusers have deviced to tap the vast energies of the planes. However,
there is behind these forms there are laws of nature, that are as strict
and simple as the law of gravity.

o
This book documents the laws of magic, especially as they pertain to
wizards wishing to found their pown guilds.  


These documents are guidelines, not rules.  A formal (and more robust!) magic
system is currently under construction.  Contact Rastlin for more information.

The initial set of skills were suggested by Quis, and Tintin took them
and made them into what they are now.  Tintin wrote a majority of the
first two chapters of this treatise, while Quis wrote a majority of the
second half.  Input from many people has influenced this book.  Special
thanks go to Elessar, Mrpr, Nick, Plugh, and Styles.
