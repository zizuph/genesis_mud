                            CHAPTER TWO
                    The manifestation of spellcraft
                    ===============================

Magic is science, spellcasting is handicraft. 

This is an attempt to make the basis for a working magic system.

Spells are divided into magic spells and antimagic ones.

All spells that protect against magic are antimagic, all others are
considered magic.

MAGIC SPELLS
============

Magic spells can belong to 2 categories:

- Instant spells
	Take effect, and then the magic is gone.
	These are spells like fireball, heal, resurrect etc.

- Duration spells
	In these spells the magic is present for the duration of the spell.
	When the magic fails, the effects of the spell go away. Duration
	can be infinite.

	Shield, wall of fire, enchant weapon

There is an other parameter for magic spells, in reference to antimagic.
They can either be reduceable or destructable.

ANTI-MAGIC SPELLS
=================

- Dispelling
	Dispelling affects duration spells in one way or an other, either by
	reducing the spell effect, or by removing it. Dispelling spells
	are always instant.

- Protective spells
	Protective spells affect instant spells and duration spells at the
	moment of casting, either by reducing spell effect, or by making the
	spell fail. Protective spells always have duration.

DOUBLE CATEGORY SPELLS
======================
Certain spells can be both magic and antimagic in nature. For instance, a Wall
of Fire would have the magic category "Fire", and the antimagic category
"Water", since water is the diametrically opposed element of fire.
When you cast a drowning spell in the room, the antimagic properties of
the wall will diminish the effects of the drowning spell. When someone tries
to pass the wall, the magic properties of the wall will attack.

SPELL STRENGTH
==============

All spells, magic as well as antimagic are given a strength number.
When a magic spell encounters an antimagic, these numbers are compared,
and the outcome is determined. Possible results are:

- Magic spell is unaffected.
- Magic spell fails if it is of the destructable type
- Magic spell is reduced if it is of the reduceable type.

SPELL TYPES
===========

Each magic spell in the game must belong to one of the 6 elements (air,
fire, earth, water, life and death). Each antimagic spell must belong to one
or more of the 6 elements. An antimagic spell is only effective against
magic spells that belong to the same category.

MAGIC OBJECTS
=============

Magic objects are considered to be normal objects with duration spells cast
on them. This includes magic objects with charges.

AREA OF EFFECT
==============

Spells can affect:
- Beings
- Objects (non-living)
- Locations

Spells can either affect single or multiple beings/objects/locations
A single object or being is selected with the methods that are used for
normal commands, or if no target is specified the being that the
spellcaster is attacking.

Single being can be:
- Spellcaster
- Other being in the same room as the spellcaster

Single object can be:
- Object in the environment or the inventory of the spellcaster
- Object in the inventory of an other object or being
- Object in the recursive inventory of an object or being

Single location can be:
- The location of the spellcaster
- A location that has somehow been previously marked as spell target

Multiple beings can be:
- Spellcaster and team
- Everyone in the location
- Everyone in the location apart from the spellcaster
- Everyone in the location apart from the spellcaster and his team

Multiple objects can be:
- All objects in the inventory of a single location, object or being
- All objects in the recursive inventory of a single location, object or being

Multiple locations should be exremely rare for spells and each case should
be discussed with an arch.

INTERNAL PROCEDURES WHEN A SPELL IS CAST
========================================

- The code of the spell determines if all requirements for successful casting
  of the spell are fulfilled, calculates strength, mana cost etc.
- The spell object calls the central spell object with parameters indicating
  spell properties, target and area of effect
- The central spell object calculates the outcome of spell vs spell interaction
  for every object in the area of effect, and calls the spell object that
  initiated the spell for each object
- The spell object produces the spell effect for each object affected

CASTING REQUIREMENTS
====================

All spells should have a number showing required magic skill for the
element and the form of the spell. If your skills are high enough you
can cast the spell without risk. If they aren't high enough, you can
still try to cast the spell, but the risk of failing and taking damage
or even dying should be high.
