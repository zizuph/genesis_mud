This directory contains examples to illustrate how /std/journal.c can be
used. What you should do:

    1. Clone the example_journal.c file.
    2. Read all the entries in the journal in order, and follow their
       instructions as to where to look in the code to see how it is
       done.
    3. Read all the code you see in this directory and the subdirectory
       to get an idea of how it all works.
    4. Mail Gorboth if you have any questions! :-)
