The world of Genesis
====================

Originally, Genesis was conceived as a torroid-shaped world with a very
specific and unusual set of principles in place to govern its planetary
reality. A single light source (star) was at the center of the donut-hole
which mean that there was a fixed sense of day/night rather than a day/night
cycle. Certain areas of the torroid would be constantly in day, others in
constant night, and some in an in-between type of constant twilight.

The backstory for this originated with Fatty, one of the founders, who
inspired the legends found in <help history> upon which these rules were
based.

Of course, it only took a few years for many domains to completely ignore
these rules, building all sorts of day and night cycles, phases of the
moon (or moons!) and seasons, years, and other individual constructs of
time that were completely distinct to their specific domains. The Admin
in those early years tried without success to suppress these disruptive
creative impulses, and so we ended up with something far afield of the
original plan.

What we have today is a patchwork of a multitude of themes and regions.
Some are completely unique to the minds of their Genesis creators. Many are
based on well-loved works such as those of Tolkien and Dragonlance. But
all are still required to adhere to one binding principle which we must
never break: this is a game of Medieval Fantasy. 

We, therefore, ask that nothing remotely modern or science-fiction based
be added to the game. Such themes as those will not fit our vision.
