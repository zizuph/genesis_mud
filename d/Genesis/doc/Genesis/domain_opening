OPENING A NEW DOMAIN/AREA
=========================
Prior to the opening of a new Domain, or area in an already open domain,
Lieges should do the following:    
   
  * Review all areas to be opened to mortals.        
      Walk through the areas.
         Look for mis-matched exits and loading errors, incoherent and
         mis-spelled room descriptions, and lack of add_item usage.  Do 
         make sure that the weapons and armours to be available to the
         mortals are within the legal limits.
      Consider asking the AoB team to review the areas you believe to be 
         'openable'.  They have a global view of Balance and might bring 
         to your attention things that you have missed.

  * Review Quests thoroughly.
      Be sure that the quest experience awards are reasonable for the
         level of difficulty. Ask other Lieges and/or Arches for opinions.
      Be sure that quest exp for each quest will be awarded one time only.

  * Check and double-check all documentation.
      Inadequate documentation will delay the opening. See 'man 
         domain_info'.    

  * Inform the AoD and the AoB of the geographical areas to be opened.
      (Pathnames, please) 

  * Inform the AoD and most particularly the AoB of any guilds, major or 
      minor, intended for opening.  (This rule holds true in all circum-
         stances, not just when a Domain is first opened.)   

  * In the case of a new domain, wait for the AoD's formal approval to
    'open', then:     
      Post (formal) notice of the Domain's opening to mortals on the 
         wizard 'domain' board.        
      Unblock exits and start shiplines. 
         You're in Business!
