This is Genesis game policy in regard to domains
------------------------------------------------

In a domain the Liege (sometimes called Lord) is the formal leader. He 
decides how the domain is run and what kind of work goes on there, but
naturally he will listen to the wizards who work there as well.

The Liege is responsible for the code his wizards produce. In other words
it's he who will take both official credit and blame for good or bad code
in the domain as the representative for the domain. Due to this situation
it's his duty to make sure that any released code works and is balanced
in regard to the rest of the game.

The Liege may open most code when he considers it ready but there are some
special cases where permission and/or notification of the relevant Arches
is required. In the case of guilds and ultimate level quests the Lord 
requires permission from the AoB prior to opening. When significant new 
areas are opened that do not include guilds or ultimate level quests, the 
Liege should nevertheless inform the AoD and AoB of their opening. For 
other code, the Liege needs no special permission to open, but the AoD 
and particulary the AoB might have opinions on it later. 

Note that in later years the Liege position has become less common, and
wizards in Genesis are more often than not working on a more global
basis, and/or in domains without active Lieges. In these cases the 
wizards report directly to the Arches, and most often the AoD.
