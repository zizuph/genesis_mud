DOMAIN STATUS
=============

For the purposes of communication and administration, domains are labelled
with a status that is a reflection of domain activity, goals, and focus.
As activities and goals change, so may domain status.

A domain has one of the following statuses:

- Active     - a domain which focuses on the creation of new areas, while
               occasionally recoding old ones. It is in some way open to
               mortals.

- Closed     - a domain which has been discarded.

- Closing    - a domain which focuses on the transfer of important code to
               other domains and on rendering its own code unnecessary to other
               domains, with a stated goal of becoming closed. 

- Limbo      - a domain which, for one reason or another, has an uncertain 
               present and future. No new code may be opened.

- Maintained - a domain which focuses on the recoding of old areas, and the
               updating of older areas when required by mudlib changes. New
               areas are occasionally opened.

- Opening    - a domain which focuses on the creation of new areas and updating
               older areas when required by mudlib changes. It is not open to 
               mortals.
