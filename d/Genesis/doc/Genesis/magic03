                  ==================================
                             CHAPTER THREE
                  Magical schools, guilds and orders
                  ==================================

It is beyond mortal comprehension to completely understand all the
various magical forms and elements described in the former chapter.
If every creature had to determine the aforementioned principles of
magic on their own, magic would be scarce indeed.  To combat this,
various groups of mortals have joined together to a storehouse of
knowledge of magic.  

There are two main types of magic on Genesis.  The first sort is that of
the common mage. Schools of mages have sprung up throughout the land,
each having its own particular flavour, or emphasis in the teaching of
its knowledge.  Some favour fire, others water.  Some life, some death.
Some teach a kind of balance, treating no one type of magic as above the
others.  Some schools favour a particular form, others a particular
element.  The common thread that links all these types of schools
together is the reliance on self.  The power of these mages comes from
their own study of the elements and of magic.  

The second main form of teaching is that of the clerical order.  Each
such order is devoted to one or more deities, which are the 
source of power for these casters.  The deities themselves grant the
spells, and prayer from the cleric channels the deities power into the
world of Genesis.  Despite this seeming singularity of the skills
involved in casting this sort of spell, nonetheless all the forms and
elements still apply.  This is so because the magic must be properly
channeled through the caster, and without careful control, the deity may
burn his priest out of existence.  Without proper skill with the various
forms and elements, the deity is limited in what he may do through his
priest.

All places of learning magic will hereafter be referred to as "guilds."
Certain strictures must bind all guilds, both priestly and magical.  

Guild tax is developed as described in the 'guilds' man page.  In
addition to the costs listed there, guilds offering spells must abide by
the following tax guidelines.  The table lists the tax per spell offered
by the guild.

Guild      Magical                Non-magical
           Layman   Occupational  Layman   Occupational
Class 1      0.25%      0.1%        1%         0.5%
Class 2      0.5%       0.25%       2%         1%
Class 3      1%         0.5%        N/A        N/A
Class 4      N/A        1%          N/A        N/A

Spell classes are defined in the following general way.  If it is not
clear which class a spell falls under, ask the arch responsible for
magic within the game.

Class 0  -- Cantrips
    Generally spells that only have cosmetic effects within the game.  
*Very* limited informational spells might be placed in this category as
well.

Class 1  -- Very minor spells
    Typically spells that harms no one, only gives limited information
and help. Examples of this kind of magic is temporary light and
darkness spells, limited information detection spells.

Class 2  -- Minor spells
    Very minor healing/damage, easy detection spells, minor defensive,
dispelling spells.

Class 3  -- Intermediate Spells
    Ordinary healing/damage, detection, defense, dispelling etc.

Class 4  -- Advanced spells
    Advanced detection spells (see stuff in other rooms, know other
people's inventories etc). Powerful attack/healing spells. Advanced
dispelling, maybe even stat-affecting spells. Limited conjuring power
for very advanced players.

Balance Requirements
--------------------
At most one third of the spells may cause damage.
At most one third of the spells may increase defence.
Each additional attack or defence spell costs 0.5% tax.

Each spell violating these strictures adds 0.5% tax.

Each spell is expected to have a material, a somatic, and a verbal
component.  Class 0 spells are not required to have any components, but
their use is suggested wherever it makes sense.  Each spell lacking one
or more of these costs extra, as defined by the following table.

missing 1: 150% normal cost.
missing 2: 200% normal cost.
missing 3: 250% normal cost.

Standard material components are valueless, other than for
spellcasting, and are available from the guild for a "small" fee.
These components disappear when the player leaves the game.  More
complex procedures to obtain components and more expensive components
may reduce the cost of a spell.  To gain a bonus, components must always
be consumed.

Quest required to get component : -25%*quest level
Component guarded by creature   : -avg_stat_of_creature
Component cost is < 1 gp        : 0%
Component cost is >=1 gp        : -25%
Component cost is >=1 pp        : -50%
Component cost is >=12 pp       : -75%
Component cost is >=144 pp      : -90%

Other special circumstances may be devised which could result in bonuses
(or penalties!) to your tax rate.  The exact details will have to be
decided by an archwizard as they are needed. 

Spell Acquisition
-----------------
Logically, each caster should not immediately be able to cast every
spell his guild offers immediately upon joining.  Rather, spells should
be learned individually or in small groups as the caster learns more and
more about his guild.  There are a plethora of methods you can use to control
this in your guild.  

o Guild stat.  All the experience earned in your guild is credited
towards the character's guild stat.  This gives an easy method of
determining the experience of the character within the guild.
Average stat may be used also, but this doesn't incorporate time spent
in the guild.  Some combination of this may be used also.

o Guild skill.  A special skill can be defined in the character which is
needed to cast spells of that guild.  This skill can be treated as a
normal skill, trained with money, or any other concievable system may be
used to increase the skill.

o Quests.  Learning each spell may require the completion of a quest.  

o Buying spells.  Each spell might be available for a price.
Availability of spells may very well be controlled by any of the above
factors.

o All available.  It is quite possible to make all spells available from
the start. In this case, most spells should have an infinitesimal chance
of working until the player has progressed somewhat in the guild.
Chances should slowly improve though probably never reach perfection.
This might be appropriate in a clerical guild.

Magical Skills
--------------
All guilds will want to offer training for magical skills to their
members.  While the skills themselves are discussed elsewhere, the
rules on offering magical skills are not.  

Each guild will have a primary element.  It is up to the guild as to
whether to emphasise breadth or just one element.  In any case, this one
element is permitted to be trained to 100% of the intelligence of the
member.  No other skill may exceed 80%, the opposite element may not be
trained at all, and the sum of the casters skills may not exceed 200% of
his intelligence.

As Element skills depend upon intelligence, so Form skills depend upon wisdom.  There are no restrictions as to which form skills a guild may train, or
as to their maximum potential.  

To summarize:
Element skill      % of members intelligence
main                       100
opposite                     0
total                      200
other                       80

Form skill         % of members wisdom
any                        100
total                      200
