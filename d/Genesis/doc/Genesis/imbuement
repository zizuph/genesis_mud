| Statement of Philosophy: |
+--------------------------+

People love random chances for rewards - Las Vegas is standing proof. This
project has been a method to introduce into Genesis a constant and varied
way for players to feel like every kill of a monster is a pull at the slot
machine - one more random chance for an unknown fun reward.

People also love collecting. This system of imbuement will create a whole
new type of collecting based on an economy of imbuement potential.

Additionally, people *really* love magic and rarely accessible powers.
The ability to wield a power that only appears in the game during a
blue moon is exciting and fun. Such effects we allow to be unbalanced
perhaps even to the point of pushing the limits of the game due to the
fact that they are so rare and unsustainable.

Finally, many people love lore and crafting-mastery. This system will
introduce into the game a rich and varied world of colorful magic that
players will have the opportunity to recognize at-a-glance, and craft
at will.

| Overview of the Build: |
+------------------------+

VARIETY OF EFFECTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Many individual magical effects (mods) have been created to shadow weapons
  or wearable items. Categories for these effects are currently thus:

  (11) Banes---------provide aid in fighting against various races
  ( 8) Damage--------create a damage special based on elemental magics
  ( 6) Stat Boost----give the user a boost in various stats
  (19) Skill Boost---give the user a boost in various skills
  (11) Resistances---give the user additional levels of various resistances
  (11) Other Effects-many different individual effects

  (66) Total mods (currently)


VARIETY OF EFFECT POWER:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  There are three potential power levels for any given mod:

    Low    (Level 1): Some useful combat aid           -- common to see.
    Medium (Level 2): Much more useful combat aid      -- quite rare.
    High   (Level 3): Excitingly powerful combat aid   -- phenomenally rare.


PROBABILITIES AND DISTRIBUTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The way in which these mods will appear in the game is as follows.

  Whenever a weapon or armour is cloned into the game, it will first check
  to see whether it has been cloned onto an npc. It will then check to see
  if the npc has already had one of its items roll for an imbuement. If
  it has not, then this item will have a chance for an imbuement (dice) roll.
  What we set up is that 1 out of every 100 npcs that carry weapons or
  armours will have a *single* piece of equipment spawn with an imbuement.
  Thus, the only way for players to find imbued items is by taking them from
  an npc.

  The dice rolls for probability of an imbuement work as follows:

    A roll is made to determine the number of mods added to an item:

    - 1% of npcs get a single mod on one of their items. (1/100 chance)
    - 10% of single mod items are upgraded to having two mods. (1/1,000)
    - 10% of two mod items are upgraded to having three mods. (1/10,000)

    When any mod is added, a roll is made to determine its power level:

    - Mods are automatically Level 1. (1/100 chance)
    - 10% of level 1 items are upgraded to Level 2. (1/1,000 chance)
    - 20% of level 2 upgraded to Level 3. (1/5,000 chance)

    This results in the following odds:

    - Mods at Power Level 1:
        - A given item rolls a single lvl 1 mod:  1/100    
        - A given item rolls two lvl 1 mods:      1/1,000  
        - A given item rolls three lvl 1 mods:    1/10,000 

    - Mods at Power Level 2:
        - A given item rolls a single lvl 2 mod:  1/1,000     
        - A given item rolls two lvl 2 mods:      1/100,000   
        - A given item rolls three lvl 3 mods:    1/10,000,000 

    - Mods at Power Level 3:
        - A given item rolls a single lvl 3 mod:  1/5,000      
        - A given item rolls two lvl 3 mods:      1/500,000  
        - A given item rolls three lvl 3 mods:    1/50,000,000 

    Lets say we want to roll a specific mod, like haste, that will
    give us just the power we want, or even more difficult, roll a
    specific powerful combination like a darkvision mod coupled with
    a darkness mod.

    Currently: (as of this writing there are 66 different mods)
    - Odds of rolling a particular mod (Level 1): 1/6,600
    - Odds of rolling a particular mod (Level 2): 1/66,000 
    - Odds of rolling a particular mod (Level 3): 1/330,000
    - Odds of rolling a specific 2-mod combo (Level 1): 1/4,356,000
    - Odds of rolling a specific 3-mod combo (Level 1): 1/2,874,960,000
    - Odds of rolling a specific 3-mod combo (Level 3): astronomical!

  So, in the end, the main way we control the balance of the imbuement
  system in the game is through rarity. Yes, there are some very powerful
  potential combinations, but they will be things that occur only once
  in a blue moon. Some will almost certainly never occur. (miracles are fun!)


CRAFTING:
~~~~~~~~

  Perhaps one of the greatest concerns for balance is the ability players
  will have to craft their own imbuements. The entire idea of putting
  into the game fully unbalanced effects hinges on the notion that these
  effects will be fleeting. Therefore, we limit the degree to which
  players can sustain unbalanced power by making the crafting requirements
  very steep three key ways - Credits required, distribution, and money.

  First though, a brief summary of the crafting theme is necessary. When
  players discover an imbued item, they may bring it to the Enchanter in
  Sparkle. Here they may purchase a so-called "nullstone" for 25 platinum
  coins. Then, the enchanter will disenchant their item, storing the
  energies of the enchantment in the "nullstone" which will be transformed
  into the corresponding "stone" type for that enchantment based on the
  imbuement lore. These stones are the currency (credits) of the craft, and
  can be stored in a portable bank of sorts called a lapidarium. Using the
  Enchanter's Forge, players can then use their collected imbuement stones
  to transfer imbuements of their choice into selected items.

  The first limiting factor, then, is the credits required. The economy
  of imbuements works on a 9:1 ratio. That meaning, any imbuement that
  a player finds, and has disenchanted, becomes 9 times weaker than the
  original imbuement, and must therefore be found 9 times in order to
  recreate the power of that imbuement. We can think of this in terms of
  credits. There are 5 "levels" of imbuements stones in terms of credit
  value:

      "cracked stone"     = 1  credit
      "blemished stone"   = 3  credits
      "ordinary stone"    = 9  credits
      "unblemished stone" = 27 credits
      "glittering stone"  = 81 credits <-- note the exponential factoring

  Stones may be <combined> when you have 3 of equal quality. Thus,
  3 "cracked" stones can combine to create a single "blemished" stone
  and so on up the chain.

  Therefore, the crafting economy factors thusly:

  +===========================+===============+============================+
  | HARVESTING PRACTICE:      | YIELDS:       | CRAFTING OPTIONS:          |
  +===========================+===============+============================+
  |Disenchant a lvl 1 mod --> |1 "cracked"    | --> Combine 3 to upgrade   |
  |                           |   stone       |     to 1 "blemished"       |
  |                           |               |     stone                  |
  +---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------+
  |Disenchant a lvl 2 mod --> |1 "blemished"  | --> Combine 3 to upgrade   |
  |or Combine 3 "cracked"     |   stone       |     to 1 "ordinary" stone  |
  |stones                     |               |                            |
  +---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------+
  |Disenchant a lvl 3 mod --> |1 "ordinary"   | --> Use to craft lvl 1 mod |
  |or Combine 3 "blemished"   |   stone       |     or combine 3 to upgrade|
  |stones                     |               |     to 1 "unblemished"     |
  |                           |               |     stone                  |
  +---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------+
  |Combine 3 "ordinary" ----> |1 "unblemished"| --> Use to craft lvl 2 mod |
  |stones                     |   stone       |     or combine 3 to upgrade|
  |                           |               |     to 1 "glittering"      |
  |                           |               |     stone                  |
  +---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------+
  |Combine 3 "unblemished" -> |1 "glittering" | --> Use to craft lvl 3 mod |
  |stones                     |   stone       |     (cannot be upgraded)   |
  +---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------+

  Here, then, the 9:1 ratio becomes apparent. When a player harvests
  a lvl 1 mod via disenchantment, they receive a single "cracked"
  stone. To craft a single lvl 1 mod, they would need 9 of these stones
  to create an "ordinary" stone of the needed type. If a player were to
  harvest a lvl 3 mod, they would receive a single "ordinary" stone, which
  would mean they needed to collect 9 more of these "ordinary" stones to
  produce the 9 needed to work their way up to a "glittering" stone of
  that type which would produce a crafted mod at lvl 3. The 9:1 ratio of
  credits-required to power-lvl-crafted is what creates a strong limiting
  factor here.

  Distribution as a limiting factor plays directly into the amount of
  credits required. Imbuements are distributed to only 1 out of every
  100 items put into the game on npcs. These imbuements are all lvl 1
  mods. Lvl 2 mods appear one every 1,000, and lvl 3 every 5,000.
  In addition, there are over 60 *different* imbuement types. Thus, to
  craft a particular imbuement, haste for example, you would need 
  to find 9 different instances of a lvl 1 haste mod in the game before
  you could craft a *single* lvl 1 instance of it on an item of your
  choice. To craft a single lvl 3 haste mod, you would need to find 81
  separate instances of a lvl 1 haste mod in the game, or 27 instances
  of a lvl 2 haste mod in the game, or 9 instances of a lvl 3 haste
  mod in the game. In this way, perhaps the easiest way to craft
  quickly is to simply seek out any lvl 3 mods or "ordinary" stones that
  people may have, and use them to craft a lvl 1 mod. To craft lvl 2
  or lvl 3 mods will be *very* difficult, but certainly possible. It
  is for this reason that we have lvl 2 and 3 mods be considerably more
  powerful and less balanced than those of lvl 1.

  Distribution, of course, will also play out based on how many npcs
  are killed in a given time frame in the game. Tests have shown a
  range from 750 - 900 npcs killed per hour, with the mean average
  hovering just below 800. If these numbers hold true, then we would
  expect somewhere between 7-9 new imbuements to spawn in the game
  in a typical hour, with the average being around 8. This, too, will
  not mean that players notice the imbued items, take them, and
  harvest them - merely that they spawn into the inventories of npcs
  for players to find.

  We must, however, take into account the hardcore player who makes it
  their sole mission to do nothing but harvest imbuements in a fully
  researched and optimized manner. These players always exist, and
  are the ones who find ways to break the system. We can look at
  results from the Ogre guild to get an idea of what is possible
  (the Ogre guild rewards players for how many npcs they are able
  to kill in a single hour.) The record set by a player for a single
  hour of npc killing is around 350. If we extrapolate that rate of
  killing to an 8 hour playing session, we would have 2800 kills,
  which would mathematically yield almost 30 imbuements. Given that
  there are 66 imbuements in the game, a player of this hardcore
  nature would need to log around 18 hours of play to find a specific
  imbuement that they might be looking for. Unless the player is using
  a bot, such a time would need to be stretched over 2 days of
  gaming at 9-hours per session. Therefore, we say a specific
  imbuement can be found by the most hardcore type of player, on
  average, once every 2 days. Using the 9:1 ratio, we then know that
  only once every 18 days will a player be able, by their own
  efforts, to craft a lvl 1 imbuement of this specific type. To
  work their way up to a lvl 3 imbuement of a specific type would
  require 162 days or around 5 months. All of this, too, is what we
  would expect only from the most hardcore of players - not the
  "Average Joe."

  The distribution will be further influenced by the trading market
  that will undoubtedly spring up surrounding the crafting potentials.
  This is an unpredictable factor that will require wizard monitoring
  to ascertain the final impact as it develops over time. We take
  comfort in the fact that even the full collecting power of an entire
  playerbase is likely to yield only 8 imbuements per hour - meaning
  that a given item will require around 8 hours to be found by anyone
  in the entire playerbase. 

  The final limiting factor is money. Each time an items is disenchanted
  it will require a nullstone, which will cost the player 25 platinum
  coins. In that the vast majority of stones will be made from lvl 1
  imbued items, the basic math gives us 25*9 = 225 plats to craft a
  single lvl 1 mod. If a player wants to try to actively harvest mods
  for their lapidarium at a rate of, lets say, 10 mods a day, then it
  will cost them 250 plats every day simply to *harvest* mods that will
  be random and not immediately useful. To actually craft your way up
  to a lvl 3 mod, assuming a player is typically only finding lvl 1
  mods from which to harvest, the math looks like 25*81 = 2,025 plats.

  One very important limitation of crafting is that unlike the random
  rolls weapons and armours get when they are cloned to npcs, crafting
  is only able to attach a *single* mod to a given item. There will be
  no "peculiar" (2-mod) or "exotic" (3-mod) items built via crafting.
  Only "unusual" (1-mod) items are possible. Crafting cannot occur on an 
  already-imbued item.

  Players always surprise us. They will find ways to harvest efficiently
  and they have plenty of money. As such, it is probable that there will
  occasionally be a player who cashes in a bunch of stones on a big
  crafting blitz to outfit themselves with power that *far* exceeds
  what we normally consider balanced. The ability to do this on any
  regular basis, however, is hopefully sufficiently limited by the above
  described factors.

  The ability to monitor imbuements and restore, recreate, or generate
  new imbued items is reserved expressly to the Admin and their teams.
