The Domain Arch

The AoD works as a global project manager for wizards. It is the
AoDs task to make sure all wizards have projects they enjoy
working on, and to listen to any concerns or issues the wizards
have. Just as the AoP is the link between players and wizards, 
the AoD often acts as a link between the wizards and the Admin.

The AoD will approve or deny new projects, provide feedback on
projects and make sure any new additions to the game follow the
theme, story and style of the domain it is added to. The AoD will 
also make sure new content is well thought out and fits Genesis 
from a game design perspective, as well as making sure any new
content is created using the correct code standards.

If a domain has an active liege, the AoD will primarily work with
the liege. If a domain has no active liege, the AoD will work
directly with the wizards of the domain.

Finally, it is the AoDs responsibility to handle new wizard 
applications, and when new wizards are accepted make sure they 
are put to work in a suitable domain. For domains with active 
lieges, the new wizard still needs to be accepted by the liege.
