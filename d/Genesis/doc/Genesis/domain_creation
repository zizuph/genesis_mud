CREATION OF NEW DOMAINS
=======================
The creation of every new Domain begins with a Great Idea, but does not 
end there.  The success of a Domain is as dependent upon organization 
and planning as it is upon the Vision of its Founders.  Therefore, before 
a new Domain is founded, a Proposal for Domain Creation must be written 
and brought to the attention of the Arch of Domains.

Proposals for new Domains should contain:

   1) A document outlining the unique theme of the Domain.    
         A Domain needs a story-line or structure under which to grow 
         and remain coherent.  Without a written Statement of Theme as 
         a guideline, future members of the Domain may pursue tangents 
         which endanger the Domain's cohesiveness, as well as encroach 
         upon the themes of other Domains.

   2) A document outlining initial coding projects on a timeline for
         completion. This ensures that the wizards of the new domain
         begin work on projects immediately, thus preventing floundering
         and idleness. An opening domain which consistently falls behind
         its self-imposed deadlines may have its status reviewed, with
         an eye toward reallocating resources to more promising
         ventures. In other words, the domain may close without ever
         having opened.

   3) A list of interested wizards and a willing Liege-candidate.
         The minimum number of wizards required to found a Domain is
         three (two wizards and a liege candidate), though more is pre-
         ferred. Additionally, a couple of experienced and trustworthy 
         wizards to assist new(bie) wizards and get the Domain off to 
         a productive and organized start is considered necessary by the 
         AoD and will affect any decision regarding the creation of a new
         Domain.               

The Arch of Domains is concerned with the creation of _viable_ Domains 
within Genesis.  Hence, proposed Domain members should demonstrate 
preparation and responsibility.  The AoD must be convinced that the 
involved parties have an understanding of the scope of the project they 
are about to undertake.  Founding a new Domain is a difficult, often 
daunting, task.
