                    Bulletin Board Use for Wizards
=========================================================================

Boards are where important developments and information in Genesis are
posted. It is important that wizards make reading these boards a priority
and regular practice. Posting, yourself, on the correct board is also an
expected behavior, should you have something people need to know.

Mrpr's Board Soul allows wizards to remotely access all the boards in
the game. Any wizard seen physically walking to a board rather than using
the <mbs> tool, therefore, should be shamed into a corner and forced to
wear a live piglet for a hat for three weeks.

Learn how to use it:

    <help mbs>     - brief intro
    <mbh mbs>      - Full feature synopsis
    <mbh tutorial> - How to use the system

Now that you've got that down, please be sure to regularly check and
read posts on the following boards which are considered mandatory reading
for all wizards:
