FOOD FOR WRAITHS
================
Wraiths come in two categories, those who gorge to sustain themselves and
gourmands. For the first category it's easy. Any poached spider or other food
stuff will do. For the gourmands, this page explains their food preferences
and how to meet them.

Ingredients
-----------
All ingredients in the food of a gourmand should be of the highest quality.
The basis of each dish should be elf or wobbit, with a preference for elf.
For presentation and receipes, the sky is the limit. Every mode of preparation
leading to a quality end result is permitted and variety is encouraged for
the main meals of the day and snacks all day round.

Distribution
------------
For the benefit of ones wellbeing, it's best not to let a wraith go hungry.
Otherwise the wraith may take it upon himself to forage on whomever he
believes to be lacking in the food provision. The elf-o-mat is ready for
turning any species - save dwarf - into elf ingredients (see above). Thus
one is strongly advised to provide quality dishes unsolicited and without
fail upon demand.

Examples
--------
The choice is limited solely by the creativity of the cook. Some examples:
thick crispy elf bacon, wobbit toes (crunchy), McWraith elf burger or nuggets,
elf sushi or steak, wobbit goulash or stew, creamie elfnog, ...
