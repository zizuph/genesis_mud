Domains and Guild Policy
========================

Guilds are a fundamental expression of any domain. Due to the influence of
mortals and by mortals, guilds are special constructs. They require more 
care and thought in their implementation than the typical area.

Certain expectations are placed on domains with respect to guilds:

- Guilds must be contextually correct within Genesis, that is, they must fall
  under the umbrella of "medieval fantasy". Lieges are expected to ensure that
  guilds are thematically correct within their domain.

- Guilds must be reasonably maintained. Domain membership rises and falls, and
  so it is cautioned that a domain should not over-extend itself when it comes
  to the number and maintenance requirements of guilds.

- Before a guild project can begin, a proposal must be submitted to the
  AoD, AoB, and Keeper for approval.

- Domains wishing to lay claim to an idea for a guild should post a notice of
  intent on the Genesis "guild" board, and place a document in the domain's
  open GUILDS directory (see domain_info). If a domain wishes to halt
  the development of a guild idea, it would also be polite to mention that on
  the guild board.

- Wizards should be careful not to over-extend their time with respect to 
  working on guilds. For most wizards, actively working on one new guild is
  enough. Exceptions occur under exceptional circumstances, however.

- Domains should be considerate and realistic in terms of guild development
  within the domain. Thus, it is asked that domains actively plan or code no
  more than three new guilds at any one time.

- The liege should inform the AoD and the AoB when he/she has decided that a 
  guild is ready to be opened or re-opened to mortals.

- Openings, closings, and re-openings of guilds to mortals must be announced on
  the Genesis "guild" board.  Disciplinary action may be taken if the following
  occur:
      o The opening or re-opening of a guild is not announced beforehand.   
      o The long-term closing of a guild to mortals is not announced.   
      o Documentation of the guild is inadequate at time of opening.   
      o Inappropriate skills or skill-levels are offered in the guild.   
      o Specials or spells are notably out-of-balance/over-powered.

- Guilds opened to mortals may be closed, but the code may not be erased or
  moved outside the domain without the express permission of the Keeper. Guilds
  erased or moved without approval will simply be re-instated from back-up.
  (See /d/Genesis/open/legal for a discussion of copyright.)

- The closing of a guild requires:
      o Documentation of the reason(s) for the guild closure in the domain's
        info or open/GUILDS directory, including unforeseen circumstances which
        led to the closure.
      o Informing the admin and domain members of the existence of the
        document. 
      o A two week period after informing the admin and domain members for
        discussion and deliberation.

Any of the above expectations may be made unnecessary with the permission of,
or by intent of, the Keeper, the AoD, or the AoB.
