The Player Arch

The main responsibility of the AoP is to assist the players of the
game with any questions or issues they may have, and serve as a link 
between the players and the rest of the wizard community. 

The AoP also handles most bugs encountered by players, either by 
fixing them within the AoP team, or by working with other lieges 
and/or wizards to fix the issues. Ideas and complaints submitted by 
players are two other tasks handled by the AoP. This does not mean
the AoP needs to singlehandedly make changes to the game or implement
new ideas, but rather it is the AoPs task to make sure such things
are forwarded to the correct wizard, and replying to the player,
as no inquiry from a player should be left ignored. A happy player
is a returning player!

Finally, it is the AoPs task to make sure the players follow the rules 
of Genesis. This includes trying to catch those misguided players who 
try to cheat, but also involves dealing with harassment issues and 
other non-RP problems between players. Should the player also have
a wizard character the AoP will work together with the AoD, and if 
needed the rest of the Admin, to find a solution.
