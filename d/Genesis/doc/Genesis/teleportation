Teleportation
-------------

Teleportation is a form of magic and should be treated as all
magic is treated. Players should not be magically teleported 
to any area unless there is a cost to that player and or a 
probability for failure. There should be checks in place as 
well that will safe guard escaping from combat and such.

Please refer to magic.
