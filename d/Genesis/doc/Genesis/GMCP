GMCP - GENERIC MUD COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
=========================================

Genesis supports the Generic Mud Communication Protocol, or GMCP, to pass
easily parsable information to your mudclient. It's an extension to the normal
telnet protocol, and sends messages invisible to the user (even when running a
client that do not support GMCP). 

The primary purpose of GMCP is to improve the availability of information
relevant to your game without providing players with a distinct advantage. As
such, any information passed through the protocol will have the same precision
or textual representation as through the normal text interface.

For details on the packages supported and the format of the parameters, see:
	/doc/help/general/gmcp_tech	(aka "help gmcp_tech")
