The Mudlib Arch

Formal definition
-----------------

This Arch is in charge of the mudlib code. He supervises and suggests
changes that should be made to the mudlib in order to meet new demands
or changes in the gamedriver, or changes and modfications that are
needed to improve the game as such. Naturally he must work in close
contact with the Balance Arch (AoB) at all times. A great degree of
understanding and cooperation is required between them to make the
game work.

Amendments
----------

Any changes for the mudlib must be verified by the AoM, if nothing
else so only in order to coordinate what is being done. It's very easy
for two people to find that they have been working on something that's
either already been done or abandoned long ago for some reason. Besides
it all needs to be merged into the source database at the CD computer.

The 'mudlib' in this context means _any_ changes of anything not in a
regular domain (Genesis is considered part of the mudlib).
