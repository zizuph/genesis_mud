                            CHAPTER ONE
                         The essence of magic
                         ====================

THE ELEMENTS
============

There are six element, which is an important fact to remember, because
six is an important magic number. In the classic teachings of quantum
magic, the six elements are inscribed in the corners of an octahedron, a
fact that makes the number 8 special in the arts of magic.
The last of the major magic numbers is 5, and the reason for this is
the practice of advanced magic. When a magic user works with vast
magical forces, he is channeled into working with one single element and
his entire focus must be on that element. To protect him from beings of
other elements who are attracted by the magic activities, the magic user
builds a pentagram, with a ward against one of the other elements at
each point of the figure. This is why the number 5 is important to magic.

The common man believes that magic is something that doesn't affect him
in his normal everyday life, but he couldn't be more wrong in this.
All the traits of living beings are reflections of the elements of magic,
as we will show below.

Earth		The element of earth governs the inanimate and solid.
		Examples of magic that springs from the earth are
		digspell, tremor, enchant weapon, detect metal
		Strength is the the trait that is connected to the earth.
		Clear evidence of this can be seen whenever someone
		lifts a stone, or swings a sword.

Air		Air is the light and quickmoving element. It governs
		communication.
		Examples of air magic include invisibility, farsight,
		speed and change weather, call lightning
		As the proverb 'quick as the wind' shows, the trait that
		connects us to the element of air is dexterity.

Water		Water is the element of the flexible and yet unyielding
		and the home of the potion makers.
		Examples of water spells are drown, breathe water,
		holy water, douse, ferment, dissolve, rain, freeze
		As everyone knows, the lack of water will quickly waste
		away any living being, and so the trait that is linked
		to water must be constitution.

Fire		Fire is the rawest and most unsopisticated of the elements.
		It is explosive and destructive, unless tamed and held
		in control at every moment.
		Among the fire spells we find light, firewall, heat,
		heroism
		The self control and discipline of beings is a reflection
		of the element of fire.

Life		Life is the essence of the living, and takes a special
		place among the elements, as far as living beings are 
		concerened. (In the same way earth is special to the
		ground, water is special to the sea, air is special to
		the sky, fire is special to a volcano and death is
		special to a demon.)
		Life is the element of choice for healers and clerics
		(doctors, who are meddlers in the arts of healing rely
		earth, air, water and fire for effect, which is naturally
		much less reliable in this aspect than the element of life).
		In this element we find common healing spells, growth,
		curing and the fabled ressurection.
		Intelligence is the manifestation of the living and growing
		part of the mind and is of course the trait that is connected
		to life. It is also of interest to note that one aspect
		of life and intelligence is that they deal with the future.

Death		Death is not very strongly manifested on the bright side
		of Genesis, but the dominant force  on the dark, outer
		planes. Still, there are users of magic that are attracted
		by the dark forces and employ things like withering,
		harm, animate dead, putrify and finger of death.
		Death is the element of the static, the unchanging and
		the past and this is refleced in the wisdom of the living.

THE FORMS
=========

In the theories of quantum magic the forms play a secondary role, but this
in no way reflects the full truth of the laws of magic. It is simply a more
convenient classification system. In the ancient scripts of wizardry, we find
a classification system that is called the formal one. In the formal system
the forms are the main criteria for classification, and the elements take
a secondary place. However, this way of classification produces very complex
problems when you classify antimagic, and this is why the formal theory has
given way to the quantum theory.

The forms are, like the elements, six in number.

Transmutation	This is the art of changing something into something else.
		The effects are normally permanent, and the magic is only
		present during the transmutation process.
		The classic example is the turning of gold into lead. For
		some reason the reverse process only works for the very
		skilled preformers of magic.

Illusion	This is the art of making something look (taste, feel etc)
		like something else. In an illusion the magic is present
		until the effect of the spell wears off.
		A classic in this field is making lead look like gold.

Divination	This is the informative art. Normally it is used to gather
		information about other locations in the present, but it
		can also be used to see into the future or the past.
		To connect to our previous examples, we can mention the
		true seeing spell, which will enable you to see that
		an illusion of gold in fact is lead.

Enchantment	Enchantment is the art of adding properties to persons and
		objects. Again the classical example is the creation of
		magic weapons. The traditional wartcurse is an other
		favorite in this category.

Conjuration	This is the art of moving and creating. Examples include
		telekinesis, teleportation, call familiar

Abjuration	Abjuration is the art of destroying and resisting magic.
		In the category we find interesting things like
		dispell magic, resist fire and remove curse.
		

It would be a mistake to believe that once you know the effects of a spell,
you know what element and what form it belongs to. There are numerous spells
with similar or even identical effects that belong to widly differing
categories, depending on the path of research and the talents of the
spell creator.
