The Arch Helper - Admin Team Member
===================================

General
-------

Admin Teams are formed of Helpers to a given Arch. These Helpers are
simply normal wizards who have been given membership in the needs of the
work that gets done by a given Arch team. 

Helper in Admin
---------------

The Helper is not a member of the administration proper. He does not
speak for the administration, or indeed even for the Archwizard to
whom he is associated in general matters. The Helper can only make
specific decisions in the area he is assigned to. Any rules or sweeping
policy decisions is set down by the Archwizard. The helper must defer
to the Arch any decisions in matters that affect other wizards directly.

For instance this means that a Balance Team Helper will not make reports
to domains directly. All his findings must go to the AoB who in turn will
read and sign the report before handing it on, in his name. Similarly, a
Player Team Helper can not on his own decide that all mortals who gained
too much experience due to a perhaps badly coded monster should be adjusted
to a lower level. This has to be settled by the AoP him or herself.

What the Helper does
--------------------

To reference what a given Arch Team Member (Helper) can be asked to do,
check the <man> pages on AoB, AoD, AoE, etc. Each Arch Team can be
listed with the <finger> command as well (i.e. <finger aop>). 

Naturally a lot of flexibility must be allowed the Arch in the matter
of the responsabilities of the Helper. However, it must be recognized
that the Helper can't speak for the Administration or the Arch
himself. It must not be seen as if the administration randomly can
expand or shrink with no prior notice, that a Helper wizard suddenly
pops in to a Lord and demands changes in the domain code or perhaps
even rearrangement of the domain members.

The amount of helpers in the game
---------------------------------

The Keeper decides what number of Helpers a certain Arch may recruit.
In practice however, the Keeper will naturally listen to the views
brougth forth by the Arches. The number of helpers can differ from
Arch to Arch.

Duration of Helper position and choice of specific Helper
---------------------------------------------------------

The Arch decides how long a Helper remains a helper just as he decides
what they do. However, to change Helpers often might prove confusing
to the wizard community, so a certain amount of continuity is indeed
recommended.

The Arch may ask anyone he pleases to become Helper. If the chosen
wizard turns out to be a generally disliked and distrusted person this
will be matter of discussion between the Arch and the Keeper, not over
the chosen Helper but over the reason of this choise and need not be
mentioned here.

Helper implementation
---------------------

As stated the Helper can be an ordinary wizard, which means he needs
special handling in the mudlib in order to work. There are specific
read and write sanctions automatically granted to all Helpers on a given
Archwizard Team, based on the scope of that Team's typical operations.
