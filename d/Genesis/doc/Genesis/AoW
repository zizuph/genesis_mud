The AoW manages everything that has to do with our presence on
the Internet. The responsibilities of the AoW includs:

- Maintaining and updating the official Genesis website. The
website should provide useful up-to-date information about the
game, should work on all popular devices, and have a visually
appealing look that draws new players in.

- Managing and moderating the official Genesis forums and 
making sure it is a place of positive discussion about Genesis.

- Managing our Facebook group and any other social media
accounts we decide to use. (Twitter, Youtube, Pinterest, etc).

- Work to increase our official client's presence and visibility
on different online stores. (Google Chrome Store, Microsoft
Store, Steam, etc).

- Handle anything related to promotion of Genesis. For example
running advertisement campaigns and/or creating incentives for
players to promote the game.

- Be a good ambassador for Genesis and work to create a positive
"buzz" among wizards and players.
