Genesis has six so-called core races, meaning these are the races that can be
selected when a new character is created. The six races are human, elf, dwarf, 
hobbit, gnome, and goblin. All races are equally strong in terms of stats, 
however, their different racial abilities set them apart. 
            
Each race has six different racial abilities and you may select any two of 
them. Some abilities are unique while others are shared between some races. 
For example, both elves and hobbits can be 'fleet-footed' while only gnomes 
can be 'well-connected'.
            
Simply select a race to see their abilities - you can always go back and 
select another race.
        
If you are not sure which race and/or which abilities to pick, don't worry,
you will be able to change your race, gender, and abilities as many times 
as you want as long as you remain in the Genesis tutorial area. So, if you 
want to, you can try them all out before you make a final decision. Please 
note that changing race, gender, and abilities will still be possible after
you leave the tutorial, but then it will come at a price.
