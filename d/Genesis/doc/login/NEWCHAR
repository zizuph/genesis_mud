Welcome to the realms of Genesis!

The administration and wizards of Genesis hope that you will enjoy your stay
with us in these realms. We take roleplay seriously in Genesis and therefore
we ask you to select a name that is fitting in a mediaeval or fantasy world!

Chivalrous pretitles (Sirjohn), statements (Iamgod), modernisms
(Carjack), obscenities (censored), spelling oddities (Johnnn) and just silly
names (Yomomma) are not permitted. 

Avoid nouns (Archer) or adjectives (Blue) as they may give conflicts with 
text parsing. Take inspiration from books or make up something yourself; 
don't use your full name (JohnBrown or JDoe). Be creative! 

Remember - what you put down with a few keystrokes may live with you for many
years!
