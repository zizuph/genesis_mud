Due to repeated offensive actions from some players, the normal
character generating process has been disabled and replaced by
this application system.

If you still are interested in playing here we would like you to
complete this application form. We will then consider it and if you
are found not to be one of the trouble-makers you will be given a
character to play with.

Press RETURN to continue.

Expect a delay of a few days (usually one week maximum) before we have
time to respond to the application. In order for us to consider the
application you have to answer ALL questions. If you don't want to
answer some of them you must give a (very) good explanation in the
comment section why you refuse to do so. We reserve the right to
refuse an application without making our reasons known.

Nota Bene!

A certain way of having your site BANNED instead of merely blocked is
to file repeated bogus applications using this service.

TYPE "quit" TO LEAVE THE APPLICATION MODE AT ANY TIME!
