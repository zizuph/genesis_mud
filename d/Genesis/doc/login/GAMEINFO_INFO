1. THE MUD CONCEPT.

    A mud game can take many forms. However, common between all muds' is
    the fact that many people are able to interact within the game at the
    same time. MUD is the acronym for Multi User Dungeon. As the name
    implies, the first muds was set in a fantasy environment. Even though
    many still are, it is far from the only environment possible. What kind
    of world you play in is entirely up to the administrators of the game
    to decide. It can be anything from a science fiction universe in the
    far future to a medieval world with castles and dungeons. This particular
    world, Genesis, is set in a medieval fantasy environment.

    You play the role of an adventurer. As you explore the world you will
    meet other adventurers who might be friendly (or unfriendly) to you.
    It will be up to you to choose your friends and enemies. As you treat
    others, they are likely to treat you. Some creatures may prove hard to
    deal with and some might be willing to trade. A few will flee as you
    approach while others will stay and fight. As you gain experience as an
    adventurer you will get better at the skills that you choose to practise.
    Whether that is to wield powerful magic or lethal swords is again your
    choice. Maybe you wish to do both...

2. HISTORY.

    Earlier there were many different kinds of mud versions. The old mud
    games have made way for newer versions with new features but the idea
    is still the same. You roamed the world looking for treasures to find
    and monsters to slay. When you gained experience you advanced in level
    until you finally made it to Wizard level where you were immortal.
    Unfortunately the old muds had a major fault. You were not able to
    affect the world in any major ways. Some muds allowed you to add
    descriptions but designing new adventures and to expand the world
    was restricted to the administrator.

    Then there was new light. A guy named Lars Pensj| designed a new
    version of mud and called it LPmud. It was early spring 1990.
    Every item and object was now defined by a piece of C code. If you
    wished to make a change, that specific code were edited. Players
    who finally reached the desired wizard level was given the ability
    to code and make changes. Suddenly the game began to grow. Wizards
    designed their own castles and filled the dungeons with monsters,
    quests and treasures.

    A new world was created. The first of its kind.  Genesis.

    After a while some things were made quite clear. Not everyone is an
    ideal designer. Some wizards created enormous treasure hoards guarded
    by a whimpy monster just to attract the players to HIS castle. Others
    were making vast empty areas which wasn't very much fun to play in.
    Again something had to be done...
    The light above the inventors head grew brighter and some new rules
    were adapted. The wizards now had to join in domains supported by a
    domain lord. Each domain were to work towards a specific goal and the
    lord was responsible to the Gods if the wizards showed bad judgement.
    With the Gods overseeing their followers work, things got more
    organized and Genesis was cleaned up.

    In the summer of '91 we were about to make a new great change of
    the game. Things that we had learned to be bad were removed or
    improved. Features that had been missed were added. The changes was
    so profound that it again became a new LPmud version. People were
    coding like crazy during the summer and made good progress.
    Today we have the game running a beta version 3.0 and things
    are beginning to take the form we wanted. The future is so bright...

    However, a large number of other LPmud games (other worlds) has popped
    up here and there. The earlier LPmud versions has been exported to
    sites near and far. The game has grown to be quite popular and we are
    proud to be able to say that Genesis is the original.

3. GETTING STARTED.

    Since you have gotten this far I assume you know how to connect to
    Genesis. What you need to do in order to be able to play the game is
    to create a player character. Your adventurer.

    [name]
    First you get a question where you are asked to type your name.
    (That was where you typed 'gameinfo' to get this stupid text...)
    Be advised that the name you enter there is the name of your
    adventurer in the game. The name you choose is for you to keep
    all through the game and it can not be changed.

    [password]
    When you have chosen a name you will be asked to enter a password.
    This password is for you to know and none to find out. It prevents
    others from playing your character and thus imposing as you.
    The password has to be at least 6 characters long and will not be
    echoed on your screen as you type it. You will have to confirm it
    by typing it a second time.

    [E-mail address]
    Now you will be asked to enter your E-mail address if you have one.
    It enables us to get in contact with you if the need should arise.
    If you don't have one, just enter 'none'. This can be changed later.

    You will now be created as a pure newbie soul. A ghost.
    When you enter the game your first task will be to find yourself a
    body. A body will dramaticaly improve your chances of success in this
    game. When you find one, you might wish to examine it and compare it
    to other bodies lying around. One might be a female gnome, another might
    be a male Human. One may be strong while another might be weak etc.
    This is for you to find out before you slip into your new body.

    Bodies found can be of six different races. Human, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit,
    Goblin or Gnome. Otherwise they might look rather alike. It is up to 
    you to determine their looks and features. You will have to decide what
    kind of life you wish to live and choose your needed skills acordingly.
    When you finaly have molded your body to your likeing, you will descend
    through space and enter the world of Genesis.

4. HOW TO GET AROUND IN THE GAME.

    When you enter the world, things might seem strange to you at first
    sight. However, there are a lot of different commands intended to
    make things easier for you. Here is a short list of some useful ones.

      [north east west south up down]  [n e w s u d]
      These are the six basic directions for you to move in.
      If you wish to go north, type "north" or "n" to move that way.

      [look]  [look at]  [examine]
      By typing "look" you look around in your present location.
      If you "look at apple" you will take a closer look at the apple
      and resieve a longer description if that item. "examine" or "exa"
      will perform the same way.  This is a very useful command!

      [get] [drop]  [get all] [drop all]
      These commands allows you to pick up things that you find. You can
      of course drop the things you carry along with you as well.
      Typing "get all red ones" will get you all red items lying around.

      [inventory] [i]
      Allows you to see what you are carrying. If you carry a bag, you will
      have to type "look in bag" to see what is in it.

      [say] [shout]
      This is very very useful if you wish to talk to someone. Just type
      "say Hello, who are you?" when there is someone to talk to. If you
      shout you will be heard in the next room as well but not further away.

      [commune all]  [commune <wizard_name>]
      This is for emergencies only! If you really need to contact a wizard
      or Keeper of the game, this is how you do it. The keepers are busy
      deities so don't bother them for nothing if you wish to keep your head.
      "commune all I want more money!" will send your wish to ALL wizards
      in the game but if your wish is for more money you might just find
      yourself in the midst of a thunderstorm all of a sudden. 
      "commune Fatty I hear you make wonderful donuts. Could you possibly
      help me out?" would have a higher chanse of success since Fatty loves
      donuts and is the only one to be interupted by your message. 

      [wield]  [kill]
      This might be useful if you are attacked...   Assume you are about
      to be eaten by a lion and can't run away. Well, you can fight by
      wielding a weapon ("wield sword") and kill the lion ("kill lion").
      But then, the lion might kill you anyway.

      [wear] [remove]
      If you have some sort of armor and wish to use it, you will have
      to wear it first. If you wish to change armor you must remove
      your old one. (remove leather armor)  (wear platemail)

      [introduce]
      When you meet someone in the game you do not instinctively know
      their name. Naturally you have to introduce yourself and your
      fellow companions to the new person.  Example: Gubgub the gnome
      and Bergabur the dwarf meet a tall handsome human wizard.
      Gubgub bows to the wizard and introduces himself. (introduce myself)
      He then introduces Bergabur to the wizard. (introduce Bergabur)
      The human wizard bows to them and introduces himself as
      Lord Styles - Ruler of Liwitch Island, male human (devious).

5. WHAT TO STRIVE FOR. THE ULTIMATE GOAL.

    Well, basically this is a game so the main goal should be to have fun.
    In reality there are as many definitions of 'having fun' as there are
    people to ask. Some like to explore and kill monsters. Some like to
    solve quests and riddles. Others prefer to just meet people and talk
    while some crave for power and domination. However, there are always
    people who enjoy making life miserable for others... If one of the
    big guys steal your stuff or just keep on harassing you, round up a
    couple of friends and give him a good beating. It is generally very
    easy to create a player and then only use it to be mean. If we find
    this to be common we will reject connections from that site or machine.
    We don't pretend that Genesis is a democracy and given a reason the
    administrators of the game will surely use their divine intervention.

    What generally is considered a major goal is to reach wizardhood.
    To become a wizard is not an easy task but perhaps one of the finest
    endings of ones mortal life. As a wizard you will become immortal.
    You will be granted power over life and death. Over the land and the
    oceans. You will be able to create new realms and fill them with
    creatures of your own and before to long you will have mortals who
    come to visit. Some will stay and explore your dungeons and some
    will try to lift a few jewels from your treasury. 

    Since a wizard is immortal it isn't really fair to harass players anymore.
    In fact we have made rules against such actions. As a wizard you are to
    set an example of good judgement and decent behavior when associating
    with mortals. As a wizard you are one of the most powerful beings in
    the game. Never forget what you are and never abuse your power.

    Life as a mortal can be hard and tedious. There will be times when
    you wonder why you ever got involved in this stupid game. The answer
    is easy. It is fun. You meet a lot of people from all over the real
    world inside this virtual world. The fact that real live persons play
    some of the creatures you meet on your journeys in Genesis, just makes
    it so very much more interesting. Whatever your definition of fun is,
    go for it. That is your main goal.

6. UPDATES ON GENESIS 3.0.   SPECIAL INFORMATION.

    The game is now open for everyone. However, we're still in a testphase
    so please expect things to be chaotic for a while yet. If you choose
    to play despite the current confusing status, please be generous with
    bug reports so that we can get things in order as soon as possible.
    Remember the [bug]  [typo]  [idea] and [praise] commands.

7. THE HIERARCHY OF GENESIS.


    At the top of the pyramid are		   Keepers
    the Keepers.				     /|\
						    / | \
    To help them they have		         Archwizards
    the Archwizards.			          /   |   \
					         /    |    \
    Each lord is responsible 		     Lord    Lord   Lord
    for a number of wizards.		     /        |         \
				        -----      -------      ---

    Each wizard work in		        W W W      W W W W      W W
    a domain. (A realm)		        | | |      | | | |      | |

    Some are apprentice				    
    wizards until they	          A   A   A   A   A   A   A   A   A   A   A
    find a domain to join.

    Mortals are the source     m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
    of the deities powers.    m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
    Without mortals there
    would be no game.

    Finally there is the Mages and Pilgrims. Mages are Lords without domains.
    A mage is usually a very competent and experienced maker of things in the
    world. The Pilgrim is described in a special chapter.

8. PILGRIMS

    You might come across pilgrims as you wander in the world of Genesis.
    Pilgrims are people who has been specially invited to Genesis as visitors.
    They are wizards, but does not contribute to the game by adding to the
    world code like ordinary wizards.

    Usually they are people who have contributed to Genesis by writing game-
    driver applications or LPC-code that makes up the basics of the game in
    some way.

    Applications for Pilgrim status can be made to the Keepers of Genesis,
    but please don't bother unless you know that you are part of the above
    cathegory. Usually the people involved haven't even made a formal
    application; they have been invited. Having successfully performed the 
    commands "ftp", "uncompress", "tar" and "make" (i.e. being Keeper of 
    some other mud) is not a sufficient reason for becoming a Pilgrim here.
