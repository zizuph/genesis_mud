Greetings,

occur in the mind - and in the heart. I am very happy that you have found it a
place where you can explore and discover the richness that abounds in our type
of fun.

difficult to fathom, please do not hesitate to contact the Arch of Players

It is our job to welcome and look after new persons who choose to stick

that accomplishment!

Now, if you have not already done so, please consider joining the official
Genesis forums, a place where you can find an abundance of knowledge:
