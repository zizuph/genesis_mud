HOW TO SEND YOUR DONATION
=========================

Thre are three ways of sending in your donation:

- By sending cash in an envelope to Mercade.
- USA and Canadian players can send a cheque or cash to Lilith.
- Swedish players can directly put money into the central account.

Sending cash in an envelope
---------------------------

When you send cash, send bills, not coins, and please send it in your local
currency. The reason for this is that it is cheaper for us to bundle several
donations from people from your country and exchange that money in one turn
than to have each of you exchanging it individually.

When you send the money, it would be a good idea to wrap the bills in a sheet
of paper to make sure that they are not visible from outside the envelope.
International mail is as safe as domestic mail as long as make sure no one
can see what is in it. To make it definitely opaque, you can use a bubble rap
envelop, or a thick paper envelop that they use for sending diskettes.

For a sizeable contribution, you may also chose to send it as "registered
mail". This will make the recipient sign for it. 

Putting money directly in an account
------------------------------------

The Swedish bank system allows you to send money directly into the central
account of Marvin without charge. The same goes for the Dutch bank system
that allows you to send money into Mercade's account. Other European players
may consider using the Eurogiro system which is relatively cheap, especially
when used for bundled donations.

USA and Canadian players can send a cheque
------------------------------------------

We have asked Lilith to collect the contributions from USA and Canadian players.
They can send her a cheque in US$ or CAN$ via domestic mail, which is safer and
cheaper. Lilith can then send all those donations to us using an international
money order. Please make your cheque payable to Ms. K.R. Graham as "Lilith" is
not known to the American banking community.

Tips to collect money
---------------------

What we have done for players from the USA and Canada, you can do for players
from your site. If you know several players that play Genesis and you all want
to make a donation for the computer, you can bundle the money and send it via
Eurogiro for only a few US$. And if there are only a few of you from the same
site, it will at least save on stamps when you send bills.

Confirmation
------------

When we receive your money, we will confirm it via mud-mail. It is therefore
necessary that you write your mud-name on a piece of paper with the money. If
you want to receive a written receipt, print the mud-mail.
