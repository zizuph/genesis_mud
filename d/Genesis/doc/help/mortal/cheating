More information on rules and cheating
======================================

Question: What exactly do you consider to be 'cheating'?  
Answer  : We consider cheating to be any word or deed that violates
          the spirit in which Genesis is meant to be played.

We understand that this is a very broad definition, and it is meant
to be. Some players are very creative at finding ways to improve 
their characters outside the intended channels. Some people think
they are very clever when they do this, especially when they don't
get caught. But anyone knows that the true challenge and fun of 
playing a game is playing it by the rules, within the context it
is meant to be played. Thus, the real winners are the ones who are
clever enough to solve those quests and develop the tactics for 
killing those monsters that others circumvent by using quest 
documents or bug-exploitation.

The penalties for cheating can be very stiff, and range from loss
of money and quest or combat experience, to death and character 
deletions. We have been known to ban the creation of new characters
and block the ability of characters to log in from problematic sites.
Repetitive and malicious violation of the rules of Genesis may require 
that we communicate with the sysops or administrators of login sites. 
This often results in the loss of player accounts, as it is considered
a violation of appropriate use agreements by most Internet Service 
Providers.

Below is a list of those things you should NOT do. It is by no means 
complete, but it does give you a general idea of things that we 
consider to be cheating offenses:

o Exploitation of bugs.
o Solving quests without doing the work (including thinking) yourself.
o Showing others how to abuse a bug or complete a quest.
o Using communication channels outside Genesis to the benefit of your 
  character or for the detriment of someone else's character.
o Using one of your characters to avenge or benefit another of your 
  characters.
o Creating a character for the exclusive purpose of posting notes
  (inflammatory or otherwise), raiding drop rooms, or instigating
  guild-conflicts.
o Purposely using/abusing link-death as an escape from combat.
o Using triggers in a client explicitly to hunt people.
o Excessive killing or hunting of other players.
o Logging in more than one of your characters at a time.
o Use of a character by two or more people, including giving one 
  'away' to someone else.
o Harassment of any kind.
