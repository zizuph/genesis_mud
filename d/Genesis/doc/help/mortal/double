NAME
        double - do a double emote
 
SYNOPSIS
        double list 
        double <emote> and <emote> 
        double <emote> while <emote> 
 
DESCRIPTION
        This command allows you to do two emotes in one sentence. Adverbs can
        be used with the emotes normally and targets can be selected as you
        do with the single emotes.
        
        You can use two different targets with the two emotes, but it is also
        possible to have both emotes directed at one person. It is possible to
        use an objective (him/her/it) in the second emote to refer to the same
        person you are refering to in the first emote. For your convenience,
        'it' will work on livings of all genders.
 
        It is possible to create an alias with your favourite double emotes.
        To insert the name of the person at the right place, you can use the
        term XX in the following syntax:
        
        alias mydouble double (<emote> XX and <emote>)
 
        The double emote ability will only work with the emotes listed in
        "double list". It does not work with other emotes, nor does it work
        with guild emotes.
