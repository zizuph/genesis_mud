MAIL IN GENESIS
===============

Here in Genesis we have a sophisticated system of post offices that allows
all players to send mail to other players. When you enter a post office,
a mail reader will be presented to you and with that reader, you can
manage your mail.

MAIL FUNCTIONS
==============

The following functions are offered to handle your mail. For their syntax,
I refer to the mail reader itself. You can examine it to get a list of the
commands attached to it and when you are in mail reading mode, you can
give the command "?" to get a list of all commands supported, with a brief
explanation of the syntax.

- Mail a message to one [or more] players;
- Add a list of people to receive a carbon copy (CC) of the message. It
  is possible (command "autocc") to automatically send a carbon copy of
  each mail you write to yourself. This means that you will have to
  clean out your mailbox regularly;
- Resend the last message if you forgot an addressee;
- List the headers of your [newly] received messages;
- Read a message [using more];
- Reply to a message. It is possible to include the message you reply to
  and edit it before you send it;
- Forward a message to one [or more] other players. It is possible to add
  some comments to the message before you send it, but you cannot edit the
  message you received. Your comments are placed before the inclusion of
  the forwarded message;
- Delete messages. Messages will first be marked for deletion, so you can
  change your mind and unmark them. However, if you erase them or leave
  mail reading mode, the messages are lost forever;

ALIASES
=======

The mail reader supports several levels of aliases. When your list of
addressees is resolved for individual player names, they are evaluated in
the order below:

- Global aliases, like the name of a domain to mail all members of a
  certain domain and classes of wizards, like "liege" to mail all domain-
  lieges or "admin" to mail all administrators of Genesis;
- Post office related aliases. Some post offices in guilds or cities may
  allow you to mail to the "council", the "guildmaster" or maybe the
  "mayor" of a town, "steward" of an area, etcetera;
- Personal aliases. If you mail to several individuals that do not form
  one of the above mentioned cathegories, you may assign a name to them
  as a group, i.e. "mudlib" if I want to mail Tintin and Glindor to
  discuss new and cool mudlib features. ;-) (command "malias")

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
===================

Mail reader development is slow since it is not a vital part of the game
as such. However, there are some plans for future enhancement of the
reader. These are:

- Enablement of Blind Carbon Copy (BCC). This means that the original
  addressees will not see that someone received a carbon copy (CC);
- For wizards we will add the possibility to move mail into a separate
  file in their directory for further use;
- Automatic mail removal. After a certain pre-defined time, the messages
  will be automatically deleted from your mailbox.

MASSIVE MAILING
===============

The mail system is designed and implemented to handle single messages with
perhaps a few people receiving a carbon copy. It is expressly not meant to
send massive amounts of mails. Many people on such a mailing list do not
want to read the message in the first place, and people replying to such
massive messages only make it worse. Massive mailing is therefore forbidden
in Genesis.

If have a great idea to be implemented, have critisism or want to share
anything else with regard to mail, you can mail the mudlib developing
archwizards (see "help wizards") or you can mail the author of this
document, Mercade.
