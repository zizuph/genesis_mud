General rules for giving quest hints to others.        
===============================================        

Sometimes, when someone asks you for help or information on a quest,
it is difficult to decide where the fine line between 'hints' and 
'illegal help' is drawn.  When asked, most wizards will say to use
your common sense. However, that particular sense seems to be rare
rather than common here, so we have included some pointers to make
it easier for you.

Rules for giving quest hints:

     1.) When in doubt, Don't. 
         If you think your hint might be too revealing, don't give it. 
         It is that simple.

     2.) Don't do their thinking for them.
         It is best to answer requests for quest hints with questions 
         that make the Questor think in the right direction.




                        QUEST HINT POINTERS
                        ===================


Giving Directions:      Lets say someone ran into a little girl who 
                        lost her ball. This person asks you where he 
                        can find the ball.

                        DO NOT lead him to it. DO NOT give him exact 
                        directions. By this, we mean: "Go w, w, s, s, 
                        search hole for ball, get ball, s, w, w, n, 
                        give ball to child."
  
                        Instead, you can say, "There is a playground 
                        south and west of here. You might want to try 
                        looking there." Or, even better, "If you were 
                        a kid in that village, where would you play 
                        with your ball?" 


Quest Seekers:          Lets say you run into someone who asks you if 
                        you know of any quests to be done in the area.

                        Rather than say, "Have you done the one where 
                        you return the ball to the little girl?" say, 
                        "There is a little girl around here somewhere
                        who needs some help." or "Have you tried asking 
                        the people in the village if they need any help?"


Helping With Syntax:    Lets say that the person has the ball, but for 
                        some reason, he can't give it to the little 
                        girl. In this case, there is probably a 
                        variation on the word-action 'give'. We will 
                        say it is 'return'. 

                        Rather than tell the person to 'return ball' 
                        or 'return ball to girl', ask him, "When you  
                        find something and bring it back to someone, 
                        what are you doing?" or say, "Think of a 
                        synonym for the word 'give'".


Should you come across a quest that you feel is too syntax-intensive
(ie, does not respond to synonyms of a word or phrase, or requires a
very obscure or colloquial/slang word that would be familiar only to 
native speakers of the English language) please make an idea report 
in the room where the syntax problem is located, and/or send a mail 
to the domain wizards explicitly outlining the syntax problem. If 
possible, please include suggestions for additional words/phrases 
that could be used.
