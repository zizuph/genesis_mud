TRUSTING US WITH YOUR DONATION
==============================

It has been suggested to do this more formally, by setting up a fund or
something to 'protect' the capital involved. However, we feel that in the
circumstances that is pretty silly. It is a lot of work to set up such a
fund and in the end you will have to trust us with the money anyway since
we have to handle it to buy the computer. Besides, if you look at the
amount of money involved we are talking about a goal of US$ 5000 initially.
Would any of us ruine our reputations worldwide for that kind of money? It
would be a pure waste of time and money to set up such a fund as it cost a
bit to set these things up and you still have to trust us.

Use of the money
----------------

We promise this: All money donated be used for the sole purpose of buying a
dedicated machine for Genesis to run on and keeping Genesis running. This
includes the cost of the machine for Genesis and Genesis' web pages, perhaps
a suitable domain name and the minimal overhead costs of gathering the
donations. It will expressly not be used for any payment to any individual.

Stability
---------

As for the stability of the Genesis project itself. What can we say? We have
been running this game quite a few years now, putting down a lot of time in
keeping it going on various sites over the world. It is one of the most
successful muds in the world. By giving Genesis an own machine, it becomes
even more stable as we do not have to rely on the kindness of others to
provide us a free machine.

Management
----------

Then there is the question of management. It is made clear that running the
mud would be a mud-internal thing, not external. We have been accused of
partialness in regard to CD members and Swedish wizards and a lot of other
nonsense by jealous and discontent people in the past. It is all rubbish of
course, but this is not a matter that deals with 'sense', but more with 
feelings. In the end you have to think it over and decide for yourselves.

Conclusion: either you trust us, or you don't
---------------------------------------------

Looking at the above paragraphs, it is easy to see that it all comes down to
trust. No matter the amount of fancy rules and expensive lawyers tape we try
to wind around this, it all comes down to trust. Either you do trust us with
your ten bucks, or you don't. If you trust us, please drop us an envelope
with your donation, and we will do our damndest to keep this game going. That
is the deal!
