SYNOPSIS
	banks

DESCRIPTION
	Banks can be found throughout the realms. They generally offer two
	types of service: changing coins and deposits.

	Since the lowest denomination of money generally is the most common,
	travellers can get burdoned with large quantities of low value coins.
	For a fee, many banks will change coins, or minimize all your coins to
	the highest denominations.

	The second service offered by many banks is the deposit. Again at a
	fee, the banks will safely keep your money. Due to a sophisticated
	system for information exchange, money can withdrawn at any branch
	office.

	In addition to money deposits, some banks also offer gem deposits.
	Contrary to money, gems can only be retrieved at the same branch where
	they were deposited in the first place. After all, one wouldn't want
	to be given back a chipped diamond where you stored a flawless one.

	For detailed syntax, visit a local bank office.
