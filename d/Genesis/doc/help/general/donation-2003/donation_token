A TOKEN OF APPRECIATION
=======================

Naturally, a stable place for Genesis is the biggest reward for your donation.
Apart from that, though, we wish to recognise the generosity in a different
way. This will be done in two ways.

List of contributors
--------------------

In several places, we will erect colums on which the mud-names of the players
who donated will be listed. Therefore, it is important that you give us your
mud-name along with your donation. If you play multiple characters, we will
list those individually as having contributed.

A token for contributing players
--------------------------------

Secondly, every contributing player will receive a token of appreciation to
carry with him or her. This token will be a donut shaped brooch, shaped after
the toroid on which all life in Genesis exists. If Fatty had not been greedy,
and desired the freshly baked donuts (see "help history"), then none of this
would ever have been possible. The brooches can be worn, and will give a few
emotes. They come in four types:

    bronze donut brooch   - donation of less than EUR/USD 10
    silver donut brooch   - donation of EUR/USD 10 till < EUR/USD 25
    gold donut brooch     - donation of EUR/USD 25 till < EUR/USD 50
    platinum donut brooch - donation of EUR/USD 50 or more

If you also donated in a previous campaign, then your donut brooch will get a
topping using the same formula as listed above, and extra emotes and some free
donuts.

When you bundle donations for a site, please write the names of all players
on the piece of paper, and list the individual contributions. Otherwise it is
not possible for us to recognise the individual donators. Also, if you play
multiple characters, please list all names for us to be able to acknowledge
your contribution to each character (and give all a brooch).
