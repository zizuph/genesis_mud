THE COMPUTER GENESIS WANTS TO USE
=================================

For those interested, we currently aim to purchase a computer with the
following hardware characteristics:

- AMD Athlon XP processor (model 2800+ or faster)
- 2 - 4 GB RAM
- 2 * ATA harddisk
- 100Mb Ethernet Card
- Un*x style operating system, most likely Linux.
- backup facility (most probably a tape device)
- monitor, mouse and keyboard (insofar necessary)

With a conservative estimate such a system would cost about EUR 2,500. There
are various contacts with Swedish hardware companies, hopefully allowing for
an even better deal. If more money is available, the RAM memory, redundant
hard drives and processor speed are the first to be upgraded.

Naturally we also need a secure location to place the machine. A place that
has good network connections, too. The computer will be installed where the
current machine is sitting. As this has been a very safe, stable and secure
place for years, it is our intention to keep it right there.
