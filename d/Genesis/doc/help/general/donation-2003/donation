DONATIONS FOR A GENESIS DEDICATED COMPUTER
==========================================

Since Genesis 3 opened to players in 1992, it has first been run on computers
generously provided to us for free. First, we naturally started at CD itself,
then for a short period we were hosted in Switserland by Dust and from then on
the game had been using equipment provided by Marvin. In 1998, Genesis had its
first donation campaign that succesfully raised over US$ 5000 so we purchased
machine that was modern to the standards of 1998. Today, our requirements have
risen and the machine does not suit our needs anymore. Hence a new campaign is
started to raise money for a new machine.

Hardware prices have come down further over the last years, and can purchase a
new machine for less than half the budget we had five years ago. With a modest
budget of EUR 2,500 we aim to purchase a machine that is several times faster
than the machine we are using now!

We want to accomplish this by asking all players to consider making a donation
for the purpose of buying another machine dedicated to Genesis. We suggest a
donation of EUR 10 or US$ 10, but you may naturally give less, or more.
