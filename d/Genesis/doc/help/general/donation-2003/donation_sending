HOW TO SEND YOUR DONATION
=========================

There are three ways of sending in your donation:

1) By sending cash in an envelope to Mercade. (address below)
2) Players from USA/Canada can ... (address closed)
3) Players from Sweden/Norway can put money directly into the central account.

Sending cash in an envelope
---------------------------

When you send cash, send bills, not coins, and please send it in your local
currency. The reason for this is that it is cheaper for us to bundle several
donations from people from your country and exchange that money in one turn
than to have each of you exchanging it individually.

When sending cash, it is a good idea to wrap the bills in a sheet of paper to
make sure that they are not visible from outside the envelope. International
mail is as safe as domestic mail as long as make sure no one can see what is in
it. You can use carton or a thick paper envelope used for sending CD-ROM's. For
extra safety you may also choose to send it as registered mail. This will make
the recipient sign for it. 

Putting money directly in an account / on-line methods
------------------------------------------------------

The Swedish bank system allows players from Sweden/Norway to send money into
the central account without charge. The same goes for the Dutch bank system
that allows you to send money into Mercade's account. Other European players
may consider using the Eurogiro system which is relatively cheap, especially
when used for bundled donations. (Ask Mercade for details.)

We have asked a trusted intermediary to accept a few PayPal donations from
people who think that is more convenient to them. For more information about
this, please mail Donation.

USA and Canadian players can send a cheque

Tips to collect money
---------------------

What we have done for players from the USA and Canada, you can do for players
from your site. If you know several players that play Genesis and you all want
to make a donation for the computer, you can bundle the money and send it via
Eurogiro for only a few euro. And if there are only a few of you from the same
site, it will at least save on stamps when you send bills.

Confirmation / your mud-name(s)
-------------------------------

When we receive your money, we will confirm it via mud-mail. It is therefore
necessary that you write your mud-name on a piece of paper with the money. If
you want to receive a written receipt, print the mud-mail. And we also need
your mud-name so we can confirm the receipt and include your mud-name in the
list of contributors.
