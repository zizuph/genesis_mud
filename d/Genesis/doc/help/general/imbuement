NAME
        Imbuements - not a command, just information.

DESCRIPTION
        As can be discovered by helping the Enchanter in Sparkle, the
        realms of Genesis have, in modern times, become subject to a
        strange phenomenon which gives a certain chance that any weapon
        or armour owned by a non-player character (npc) in the lands
        will be imbued with various forms of enchantment above and
        beyond their normal attributes. 

        The chance that this will occur is quite small, making such
        imbued items exceedingly rare. Imbued items can be discerned
        by "unusual", "peculiar", or "exotic" appearance.

        Visit the Enchanter's Shop in Sparkle for detailed information.
