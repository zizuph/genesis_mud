	Apart from the remarks on the web page, here is a bit more
	detailed explanation of the rankings:

	1) Not all players appear in the rankings -
	   * Players below wanderer level are excluded automatically
	   * Some players indicated they do not wish to appear in the
	     rankings using 'options web no'.
	   * Only active (i.e. logged in during past week) players are
	     represented.

	2) The upper tables rank characters on their lifetime data
	   in Genesis and are explained as follows:
	   * Athletes - average of strength, dexterity and constitution
	   * Minds    - average of intelligence, wisdom and discipline
	   * Careers  - normalized averaged guild experience
	   * Overall  - average of the three positions above
	   * Elders   - player's age in Genesis

	3) The bottom tables rank characters on their achievements
	   during the past week and are divided into two categories:
	   * Heavyweight - players above expert level
	   * Lightweight - player between wanderer and expert level

	   The tables ranking subjects themselves are:
	   * Killing machines - combat experience during the week
	   * Money makers     - change in amount of money in bank and
				on character during the week
	   * Habitues         - time spent in the game during the week
	   * Craftsmen        - general experience during the week

	4) The archive of the rankings is kept for four weeks.

	5) In case Genesis administration decides a player abuses game
           mechanics solely to advance in the rankings, ranking of
           that player might be suspended.

	For any question regarding the rankings you should mail AoW.
