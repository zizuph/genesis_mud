SYNOPSIS
        This is not a command, simply information.

DESCRIPTION
	A domain is an autonomous unit of the Genesis Donut. Usually a
	domain encompasses a large landmass or two and is subject to a
	specific autonomous theme. The domain is led by a Liege who is
	sometimes accompanied by a Steward. The team of the domain also
	includes a number of wizards and mages.

	For a better acquaintance with the domains of Genesis, please
	visit the Tower Of Realms at the Old Town of Sparkle.
