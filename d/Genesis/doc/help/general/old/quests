General information regarding Quests
====================================                     

Some quests are very simple, with little risk involved. Others
can be very dangerous, and solvable only at risk of death. All
Quests are intended to exercise the minds of Questors. They are
intended to be solved within a role-play context, and as such, 
not all quests are intended to be solved by everyone. Some quests
will even make your alignment drop below neutral. In such cases,
redeeming yourself of the evil in your soul will be very hard
and pain-staking, often taking much time to accomplish redemption. 

Cheating on quests undermines the game in many ways, from causing
the devaluation of quest experience (harder, more difficult quests
for much less experience), to angering the wizards who spent dozens
of hours creating the quests. 

Cheating on a quest means you risk losing up to 10 times the amount 
of quest experience you gained or would have gained. If you help 
others cheat on a quest, leading them around by the hand, telling 
them what to do or basically doing the "thinking" part for them, 
all those involved will lose up to 10 times the amount of quest 
experience which would have been gained by the Questor. The larger 
and more rewarding the quest, the greater the cost if you are caught 
cheating on it.
