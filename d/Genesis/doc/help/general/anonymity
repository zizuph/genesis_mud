             PLAYER ANONYMITY - A VITAL AND PROTECTED RIGHT

There is one thing that you just don't do. If you do this thing, it is so 
uncool that we don't care if you did it in the game, on some chat channel, or 
hanging out in a bar with your friend drinking select craft beverages. 

 !!! You do not reveal the alts of a character other than yourself. !!!

Simple. One thing. You don't do it. If you do it, you create an unrepairable 
rift for that player. If we see you do it in the game, you will almost 
certainly be deleted. If we see you do it in a chat channel outside the 
game, almost certain deletion. If we walk by you while you are talking 
to a friend in RL, and overhear it, you are almost certainly deleted.

Of course, facts always matter. While deletion is the almost certain outcome
of breaking this rule, we do not want to apply a blanket approach to all
circumstances. Facts will matter.
