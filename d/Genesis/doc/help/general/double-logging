Double Logging:
================

  Double-logging is a player who logs in multiple characters at the same
  time. These are characters controlled by one person. Each player should
  only ever have one character logged in at any given time. There are
  various reasons on may wish to login multiple characters, but all are
  against the rules and as such carry consequences.
  
  These situations are against the rules. Genesis is a social game as much .
  as it might involve battle. Meet new people, make friends, find those 
  who you can team with and learn more about the realms. If you wish to 
  play by yourself, you must do so alone.
  
  Double-Logging includes logging in when another character is link-dead.
  
  To avoid any chance of double-logging and as such avoid any punishment
  Please use the <second> command to add any other character you may have
  to your account. You do this by typing <second a name> where name is the
  name of the character you wish to list.  
  
  Should a player choose to double-log they may face:

      1st offense: Loss of 1/2 of all combat experience 
      2nd offense: Loss of ALL combat experience 
      Beyond this: Deletion!
      
  Naturally, the devil is in the details here. There very well may be times
  where the activities performed in the first offense alone are so unwelcome
  in Genesis that I simply decide to delete you and your characters on the
  spot. It is always good to leave room for a bit of subjectivity where
  cheating is concerned, both for leniency and for harsher measures of
  punishment, so this will be no exception to that philosophy.
