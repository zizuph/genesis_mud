DONATIONS FOR A GENESIS DEDICATED COMPUTER
==========================================

Since Genesis 3 opened to players in 1992, it has first been run on computers
generously provided to us for free. First, we naturally started at CD itself,
then for a short period we were hosted in Switserland by Dust and from then on
the game had been using equipment provided by Marvin.

In 1998, Genesis had its first donation campaign that succesfully raised over
US$ 5000 so we purchased machine that was modern to the standards of 1998.

In 2003, a second campaign was held as the requirements had risen and the
machine did not not suit our needs anymore. Hence a new campaign was started
to raise money for a new machine, which succesfully raised almost USD 5600.

This hardware is no longer used today, as we are now operating in the virtual
world provided graciously by one of our admins, who works at a cloud provider.

To read about these campaigns, please read the other help pages on this topic.
They are:

- donation             (this text)
- donation_rights      (your rights when you donate)
- donation_token       (a small token of our appreciation)
- donation_trust       (trust us with your donation)

Help us to create a bright future for Genesis! For us all ... for yourself!
