NAME
        Race-hobbit

SYNOPSIS
        This is not a command, simply information.
        
DESCRIPTION
        As a hobbit you may select two of the following six racial abilities:

        Stealthy
            You will get a ten skill level bonus (up to superior guru) in 
            sneak and hide.
                         
        Fleet-footed
            If you are not in combat, you will be able to recover your energy
            quicker after you get tired.
                         
        Insatiable    
            You will be able to eat more food than other people, meaning you 
            will not tire as easily.
                         
        Tenacious
            You will recover lost experience (from death, leaving guilds, 
            etc.) faster than other people.
                         
        Opportunistic
            You will have a slightly higher chance of scoring a critical hit
            (additional damage) on your enemy.
                         
        Explorer
            You will get a ten skill level bonus in herbalism, awareness, 
            location sense, and tracking.
