DONATIONS FOR A GENESIS DEDICATED COMPUTER
==========================================

Ever since Genesis 3.0 opened to players in 1992, it has been run on computers
generously provided to us for free. First, we naturally started at CD itself,
then for a short period we were hosted in Switserland by Dust and from then on
the game has been using equipment provided by Marvin.

This is a very nice situation, but not one that we can expect to last forever.
One day, sooner or later, the university will decide to use the equipment for
another purpose, or cut the maintenance costs, or the machine may break, and
then we are on the street. To prevent this from happening, we have now decided
to start raising money to purchase a dedicated machine for Genesis.

The recent plummeting of hardward prices naturally enables us to do this. When
Genesis grew, it needed hardware that was out of reach for even a group of
individuals to afford. The machine provided by Marvin new cost several tens of
thousands of US$. With only a modest budget of US$ 5000 we aim to purchase a
machine that is several times faster than the machine we are using now!

This we want to accomplish by asking all players to consider making a donation
for the purpose of buying a dedicated machine. We suggest a donation of US$ 10,
but you may naturally give less, or more.
