THE RIGHTS YOU GET FOR DONATED MONEY
====================================

What will the contributors receive for the money they put into a computer
for Genesis? Basically all you get is a place to play in. With enough money
we will be able to provide a machine on which to run the game. To be frank,
a donation does not even give you the right to play. People who violate our
trust in a major way will still be expelled in the extreme cases.

A token of appreciation
-----------------------

However, in recognition of your generosity, we will put your mud-name in a
central list. Apart from that, we will give all contributors a small token
that they can use in the game for the purpose of atmosphere. That is all!
You will not receive a say in how the game is run, no extra experience, no
vote in some council or anything like that.

Donating is voluntary
---------------------

Making a donation, large or small, is totally voluntary. We kindly ask you
to consider giving a small amount of money, US$ 10 is what we suggest. There
is no obligation whatsoever. It is not for us to look inside your wallet.
Playing Genesis has always been and will always be FREE of charge.

Administration
--------------

In the future, the game will continue to be run the same way as it is run
today. The people in charge, the administration, decide what happens. That
administration need not consist of the people raising the money, but you
must realize that the people with hands-on access to the hardware do sit in
a special position, but this cannot be avoided. We just feel that it would
be a real shame if Genesis were to disappear due to lack of hardware to run
it on.
