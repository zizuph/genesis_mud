THE COMPUTER GENESIS WANTS TO USE
=================================

For those interested, the machine purchased for Genesis has the following
hardware characteristics:

- Intel Pentium II processor at 450Mhz
- 512 MB RAM
- 8GB SCSI harddisk
- 100Mb Ethernet Card
- NetBSD operating system.
- backup facility (most probably a tape device)
- monitor, mouse and keyboard

With a conservative estimate such a system would cost about US$ 5,000. There
are various contacts to Swedish hardware companies, hopefully allowing for an
even better deal. If more money is available, the RAM memory and processor
speed are the first to be upgraded.

Naturally we also need a secure location to place the machine. A place that
has good network connections, too. Marvin has already indicated that he will
most probably be able to host the Genesis dedicates machine close to where
we are sitting now. As this has been a very safe, stable and secure place for
years, it is our intention to keep it right there.
