NAME
        Race-ogre

SYNOPSIS
        This is not a command, simply information.
        
DESCRIPTION
        Since becoming an ogre is a complete transformation of your mind and 
        body you will remember nothing of your old racial abilities. As an 
        ogre you will be granted the following preset racial abilities 
        instead:

        Insatiable    
            You will be able to eat more food than other people, meaning you 
            will not tire as easily.
            
        Resilient
            Your resistance to magic, and especially poison, will be stronger
            than other people.
            
        Being an ogre also means you will have other ogre-specific benefits
        and drawbacks.

        Ogre benefits
            - You will receive a considerable strength and constitution boost.
            - You will be able to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.
            - Your thick hide will act as a natural armour. 
            
        Ogre drawbacks
            - Your intelligence and wisdom will be extremely low and your
              dexterity will suffer a little bit as well.
            - Due to your size you will fight at a slower pace.
            - You will not be able to wield one-handed weapons.
            - You will not be able to wear shields.
            - You will not be able to wear armours other than special 
              ogre-sized armours.
            - You will not be able to sneak or hide.
            - You will not be able to whisper without being overheard.

        If you stop being an ogre you will return to your old race and the 
        benefits and drawbacks of being an ogre goes away. You will also get
        your old racial abilities back.
