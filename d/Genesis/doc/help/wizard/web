This is a brief instruction for writing web pages for Genesis.

Setup:

  All domain web pages reside in the domain top level 'www' directory
  and in there become available for external access through a web
  browser. Other domains can also link to any page in any 'www' top
  level dir; for instance Gondor may link to Shire in their web pages
  when speaking of that area.

  While the top level dir is called '/d/<domain>/www' in the mud, from
  the web perspective the path is always '/d/<domain>/', leaving out
  the 'www' part. This might seem a bit confusing, but it's a
  consequence of the underlying php mechanism the web site is built
  on. Believe me when I'm saying that it makes sense from that
  perspective even if it feels a tad confusing to you.

Page mechanics:

  Web pages *can* be written in pure HTML if you wish. This is not
  encouraged however, as it makes you entirely responsible for the
  entire layout of those pages. However, if you still wish to write
  such pages that's just fine. Make sure they have the '.HTML'
  extension of any regular HTML file, that's all.

  The reason we're not encouraging this is that while writing HTML one
  often spends an unproportionate amount of time jiggling with
  presentation as compared to that spent on the actual content. From
  the game point of view the content of the pages is the important
  bit, the presentation is something we'd rather handle for you.

  For that purpose you can write ordinary text files, ending in the
  extension '.txt' which the web system then will automatically
  translate into HTML when they are viewed, applying a unified
  presentation scheme for seemless integration into the already
  existing pages.

Page layout:

  Obviously there's some special gadgettery involved to make the pages
  work. We've tried to keep this to a minimum though, to make them as
  easy to write as possible.

  * The entry page is called 'index.html' or 'index.txt' depending on
    your choise of scheme. If both exists, the 'html' page will be
    chosen in preference of the 'txt' one.

  * The first line in a file, that is, line #1, NOT the first line
    with text in it after a series of newlines, should contain the
    page title. If you don't want a page title leave this line blank
    but please note that this will leave an awkward-looking blank
    space in the path field of the resulting page in the browser.

  * The actual text content must start on the second line in a file,
    that is, line #2, NOT the second line with text in it after a
    series of newlines. The reason for this being that the web
    mechanism replaces the first ordinary typed letter with a nice
    gothic initial.

  * Any newlines in the text will - unlike ordinary HTML - be
    preserved in the output. This means that unless you specifically
    want a line break you shouldn't write one either, and instead just
    write one long line of text. The browser will break the lines
    suitably when viewed later.

  * You should write and check. I.e. just put the text into the www
    dir and then immediately go to the web site to see the result.
    Occasionally you'll have to reload a page (usualy shift-reload) in
    order to make your browser drop the already cached data to see the
    change, but most often just reloading it will suffice.

  * You may link to external sources if you like, but please don't.
    We *know* the stuff on the server works because we maintain it but
    when linking outside there's no guarantees. I think you agree that
    there's nothing as frustrating as being met by '404 Page not
    found' message when surfing...

  * You may insert as much HTML markup as necessary in order to
    produce a desired effect, but please spend as little time on this
    as you can. For those of you who haven't bothered learning HTML
    yet there's a small but quite sufficient list HTML tutorial at the
    end of this text.

  !!!! Do *NOT* add Javascript, CSS, Applets or anything like that to
       your pages without the explicit consent of the webmaster. Apart
       from most of the time being just vagely compatible with various
       types of servers it's also almost impossible to maintain over a
       longer period of time, and as you know by now Genesis is a very
       long-term project. I'm worried enough about the web server
       setup from that perspective without having you add more
       problems. :)

Short HTML tutorial:

  You'll need to know a small bit of HTML in order to link to other
  pages, add images to your text and so on. There's a ton of web sites
  on the net that will teach you beginner level HTML and you are
  welcome to use them as well. However, this text with a very minimum
  of HTML should suffice for writing Genesis pages.

  You can add any HTML you like to the text pages you write, so don't
  hesitate to make use of them if you feel them improve on the result.

  For the remainder of this text I'm assuming that your domain is
  'Genesis', just replace that by whatever domain you're a member of
  in your web code.

  Web site structure:
  
    Just a short note here about structure. Just as in the domain it
    makes little sense to keep everything in one directory. Instead
    organise your material as logically as possible and you'll find
    that it becomes a lot easier to maintain. Strictly speaking the
    only thing that absolutely needs to be on the web top level is the
    index file.

  Links:
 
    All links must be absolute relative to the web top of your domain.
    Assume you want to link to the document 'foobar.txt' you have put
    in the www dir:

        This is a <A HREF="/d/Genesis/foobar">foobar</A> link.

    The word 'foobar' will become clickable and lead to the foobar.txt
    page.

  Special links:

    The web server mechanism provides a special link developed only
    for our use. If you look at the bottomm of the page
    http://genesis.tekno.chalmers.se:81/d, you'll notice two very
    particular-looking links "Continue reading:" and "Show me how to".

    Assume you want to add a 'Next page: Barfoo' link to the page
    'barfoo.txt', you do that like this:

    {strip}
      {pagelink pre="Next page:" name="Barfoo" href="d/Genesis/barfoo.txt"}
    {/strip}

    NB! There is no leading '/' at the beginning of the href argument and
        all instructions are written in lowercase!

  Images:

    Images should naturally be small in order to make it possible for
    people on dial-up connections to view the pages without having to
    wait ages for the data to be downloaded.

    For resaons of structure I suggest you put all images in an
    'images' directory in the 'www' directory. You can show JPG, 
    PNG and GIF images in our pages.

    Add an image 'foo.jpg' to the page like this:

        This <IMG SRC="/d/Genesis/images/foo.jpg" ALT="Foo image"> is a
	nice foo image.

    The 'ALT="Foo image"' instruction tells the browser to display
    that text instead if the browser can't show image for some
    reason. Usually these reasons are treefold:

    1: You fucked up and forgot to upload the image to the www
       directory, or put it somewhere else from where you said it
       would be.

    2: The user has instructed the browser not to display images.

    3: The user is using a browser incapable of displaying them, like
       lynx or something.

    The 'ALT' instruction is strictly speaking not necessary, but very
    nice to have in there.

    If you have a very big picture you want to make available to
    people, the proper way of doing that is using a "thumbnail". A
    thumbnail is very small version of the original image linking to
    the big one. This makes the page easy to display for everyone and
    those who want to spend the time waiting for the big image can
    easily choose to do so.

    First start by producing a small version of the original using any
    image processing tool. There's any number of free programs out
    there for that purpose, so that shouldn't be a problem. Call that
    image 'foo_small.jpg'. Now wrap the big image in the small, using
    a link:

        This <A HREF="/d/Genesis/images/foo.jpg" BORDER="2"><IMG
	SRC="/d/Genesis/images/foo_small.jpg" ALT="Foo image"></A> is
	a nice foo image.

    The 'BORDER="2"' (NB! Quotes around the number!) tells the browser
    to put a 2-pixel wide border around the picture, making it easy
    for the viewer to see that it is a clickable link.

  Text enhancement:

        This is <B>bold</B> text.

        This is <I>italicised</I> text.

        This is <B><I>bold and italicised</I></B> text.

    And yes, as you'll discover soon after reading your first HTML
    tutorial, it *is* possible to make blinking text. Blinking web
    pages, however, should be outlawed by international treaty with
    the perpetrators sent off to face serious charges of chrimes
    against humanity in the Haag international court, so I won't teach
    you how here. *grin*

  Lists:

    There's three types of ordered, unordered and definition. You
    write the first two in much the same way:

    An unordered list is simply a list with a bullet in front of each
    entry

    <UL>
       <LI>First entry
       <LI>Second entry
    </UL>

    This will produce a list like:

       * First entry
       * Second entry

    In an ordered list the bullets are replaced by numbers, enumerating
    the entries. You create one by using <OL></OL> instead of <UL></UL>.

    This will produce a list like:

       1 First entry
       2 Second entry

    A definition list is a list where you get to define the 'index' part
    of the list yourself. Here is one:

    <DL>
      <DT> First entry
        <DD> Foo
      <DT> Second entry
        <DD> Bar
    </DL>

    This produces a list like:

        First entry
	    Foo
	Second entry
	    Bar

  Tables:

    Tables are strictly speaking rather complicated things as compared
    to the previous instructions. However, as I myself aren't too fond
    of the layout of the aforementioned definition lists with the
    index part on one line and the defined text on another, the only
    good way of organising text on the screen is using tables. Because
    of that I'd like to tell you about them here.

    For instance you may view the domain top page
    (http://genesis.tekno.chalmers.se:81/d) as an example of a page
    making use of tables to display text with sidelines.

    Tables are organised into table rows and table columns. You simply
    add as man rows as you need, one after the other, and on each row
    you add as many columns as you need. NB! You must define *all*
    columns on *all* rows even though they may be empty. I.e. if the
    widest row contains five columns but all the rest only contains
    one, you *still* have to type in empty columns for the rest.

    Write a table like this:

    <TABLE CELLPADDING="5">
      <TR>
         <TD>foo</TD>
         <TD></TD>
         <TD>Bar</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
         <TD></TD>
         <TD>Ack</TD>
         <TD>Poo</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
         <TD>Voo</TD>
         <TD>hoo</TD>
         <TD></TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>

    The resulting table will look like this:
    
    foo     Bar
        Ack Poo
    Voo hoo

    You may put anything within <TD></TD> pairs; images, text, even
    other tables. Putting a BORDER statement in the TABLE statement
    will produce a drawn border between the cells. You can also
    experiment with the CELLPADDING statement that puts in separation
    between the contents of the different cells.

    There's a lot more statements available in tables and cells too,
    for instance for aligning text, adding colour, defining width etc,
    but you'll have to look them up on the 'net if you feel you need
    them.


This should be sufficient information to get you going writing your
own web pages, so... get going!
