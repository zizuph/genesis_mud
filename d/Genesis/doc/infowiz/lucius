Lucius had lurked in Genesis for decades, having done many things here, there
and all about. He served as AoD for a time, helping to rework the domain
system to allow individuals to have Lordship over multiple domains with
his clever code. He is also known for rewriting Aridor's thief soul for
inclusion in the mudlib. He is among our finest minds, and so if you see
him, know he is worthy of your respect.
