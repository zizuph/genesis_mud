He has completed the work on /open/rfc0007 which is:
A series of commerce libraries that allow wizards to "commerce-enable"
a room or NPC. The room or NPC will then either buy or sell a
certain commodity to or from the player, who will get a reward
of cash and general experience. The reward will be greated depending
on the amount of strategy the player applies in their trades.

All domains are encouraged to implement code based on this library.
Talk to Raven about how.
