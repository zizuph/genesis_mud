Tricky is responsible for the Hobbits starting location. He is also known
as the poking wizard. Watch your ribs when you meet him!

Having become burdened by the outside world, Old Trickster has decided 
to lay down his great mantle as caretaker of mortal concerns until
such time as he again has time.

Watch out though, he can still get you!
