Administrative position: Archwizard of Gamedriver (AoG) and Archwizard
of Mudlib (AoM).

Cotillion is a REALLY old hand at this game. Aside from having been a
Keeper on DemonsGate MUD he has been AoB here in Genesis, and has been our
Gamedriver Guru for years, and now he is also the AoM. He tinkers with the 
very force of Gravity - donot defy him!!
