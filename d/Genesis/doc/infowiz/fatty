The fat one once more has returned, bloated, to his greasy lair. His one 
time bout of activity (as temporary Keeper) resulted in a new administration
which secured the flow of binary donuts he craves.

Fatty also used to run the game as Keeper along with Mrpr in the distant
past, and it's no doubt then he acquired his unsatiable appetite for
electronic pastry.

As the Lord of Relic he has attempted both to create an institute for
derelict mud-wrecks like himself as well as a domain where huge
numbers of milling mortals are necessary to solve the tricky problems
he spews forth. As of late though, the high-carbohydrate diet has taken
its toll and apart from the occational rumbling of his bloated tummy,
nothing much is heard from him.
