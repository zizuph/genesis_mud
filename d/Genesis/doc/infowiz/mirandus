Administrative position: Archwizard of Players (AoP)

Who thought a KENDER could become the AoP? Nobody! But it happened,
and Mirandus has done a fantastic job as AoP for many years now. Yes,
you read that right. He has managed to endure the player-complaint
onslaught for MANY YEARS. Crazy! Even for a kender.
