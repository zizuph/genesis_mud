Gwyneth began in Ansalon where she coded Kendermore and the Secret Society
of Uncle Trapspringer. After a brief time as Liege of Krynn, she went on
to Gondor, where she eventually became Liege. In Gondor, she coded a paint
shop, jewelry store, orders of chivalry and co-coded the Thornlin Militia
with Auberon. Gwyneth helped Stern establish events, and is a member of the
AoE and AoD teams. She loves to code, and is a certified bug exterminator.
If you give her a sparkly object or a sweet treat, she may be persuaded to
help you with difficult coding questions.
