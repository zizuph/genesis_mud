Morticia is the only wizard in Genesis to suffer from ther intrusive 'R'
syndrome.  She acquired this non-communicable condition through years
and years of contributing valuable code and idears to the Terel Domain.
Even though she serves in no offical capacity (so don't bug her if she's
busy!!), she may be available to assist you with any coding questions
you may have.  So long as you ask her nicely, that is. :-)
