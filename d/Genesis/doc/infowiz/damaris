Having served as our resident Dragon Nymph in charge of Domain issues for
quite a long time, Damaris has well earned her Mage Status. Hopefully we'll
see her again before long - rumor has it that there is some sort of Dark
Portal to that she is barely holding shut with her tail, that once opened
will spawn all manner of horrors upon the game.
