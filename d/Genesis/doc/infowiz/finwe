Following stints as a Steward, AoP, Mage and now as Liege, Finwe has 
settled down and enjoys his time doing what he loves best, tinkering 
with code and expanding areas. Often he can be found up to his elbows 
in many projects, but still finds time to visit with his mortal 
friends and assist where needed.
