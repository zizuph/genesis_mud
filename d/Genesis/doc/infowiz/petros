Petros has retired from his long toils on the Admin, and now enjoys well-
earned status as a Mage among the wizard community.

Most recently, he served as AoE for a time.

Also, he was AoB for more than six years, doing seminal work in the
development of game systems for the modern era of Genesis. His contributions
as an Archwizard have been invaluable, and he stands as one of the chief
architects of the state of the current Genesis.
