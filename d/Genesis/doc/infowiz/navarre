Navarre has slipped into the grips of RL, but is sometimes still able to
work his magic spells in the realms of Genesis. He has contributed mightily
to the lands of Krynn and Ansalon over the years, as well as a large effort
put into the recoding of the ScoP guild. He has done great work for the
Balance Team for many years, in addition to his work as Liege of Krynn,
from which he has now retired.
