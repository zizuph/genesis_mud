Aridor is the exalted former Lord of Krynn, and now holds the rank of
Mage in recognition of his devotion and effort spent in the game.

He has risen from the lowly ranks of a mortal to become the Lord of 
Krynn three times. At present he has become a rare sight indeed in
the realms of Geensis, probably due to RL, whatever that may be.
Make him feel welcome when he stops by. (And while you are at it, 
finger Percy and wonder how a wizard can serve a domain for this 
long)
