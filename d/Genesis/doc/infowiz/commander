Commander is one of the original coders of this particular brand of Genesis.
Traces of his work can be seen everywhere, no matter how much rewriting
gets done. His somewhat particular style of coding (some call it inspired,
some call it individual, but most characterize it as undisciplined) will
shine through somewhere anyway.

He's not a common site on these lattitudes any more, (un?)fortunately.
