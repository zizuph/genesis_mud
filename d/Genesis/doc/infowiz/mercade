Mercade was for many many MANY years the Archwizard of Mublib, but
most importantly he was the oracle of Genesis. Whenever a wizard
needed help with anything from newbie questions to really complex 
matters, Mercade always took the time to help out, and like all
oracles, he always knew the answer. This, now retired, friendly dour 
dwarf is a living legend among wizards.
