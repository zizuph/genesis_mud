Carnak was for many years the Steward of Krynn and a trusted member
the AoB team. Eventually he became a member of the admin as the
Archwizard of Balance and started an ambitious global rebalance
project. He retired from the admin and wizard life in November
2021, and is currently enjoying life far away from computers. Just 
kidding! He's a super-skilled programmer and has probably figured out
a way to upload his mind to a computer by now.
