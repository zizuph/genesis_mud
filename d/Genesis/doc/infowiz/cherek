Cherek is the current Keeper of Genesis, as well as the Arch of
Domains and Liege of Web. Before that he was AoP, AoW, and AoE. 
As a mortal he tried most guilds in the game, and it seems like
he is doing the same with admin positions. Gotta catch them all!

He's one of those "enthusiastic types" that everyone gets warned 
about at Ren Fairs. But! He knows how to sell the game and get
people interested in Genesis, so we are lucky to have him doing this
instead of selling card games or something.
