Marvin is cool, he made cool additions to both the gamedriver and the
mudlib (such as much of the LPC language and interpreter). He has a cool
attitude to wizards who complain about his cool code additions. And last
but not least, he's cool because he's got a liquid-nitrogen internal
cooling system.

Unfortunately it seems that as of late his coolness seem to be that
more commonly associated with rigor mortis. With luck he'll thaw up
enough to visit us again in some distant future.
