A business collegue of DEATH (you know, the extremly thin guy with a liking
for scythes and timeglasses?) roaming the world of Genesis. Evil tongues
have been heard to whisper phrases like "mostly harmless" when asked to
characterize this fellow, but they will surely regret their flippant words
on the day of judgement!
