Styles has contributed greatly to Genesis, including the suggestion of the
name 'Genesis' to Lars. According to a foreboding prophecy from Fatty his
domain Liwitch will open no earlier than the very day before Genesis is taken
offline and disappears from the world forever! Therefore, the administration
hid his domain in a place where it has not been found for well over a decade...

However... tremble at your knees if you will. Styles has now been seen roaming
back and forth over Genesis in search of his long-lost island. Perhaps he will
one day find and restore whatever cunning plan he has. Maybe this won't mean
the end of the world, as we know it, after all.
