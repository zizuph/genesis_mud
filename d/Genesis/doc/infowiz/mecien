Mecien has retired from the position of Keeper he held for quite a long
time. After a spell of absence due to RL (tm) obligations, he was seen
for awhile holding the position of Lord of Terel.  As it turns out,
he has once again fallen victim to his RL (tm).

Perhaps, if we are lucky, Mecien will one day succeed in losing his
RL...so that he may spend more time online here? :-)
