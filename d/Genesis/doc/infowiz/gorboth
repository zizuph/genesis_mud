Gorboth was the Keeper of Genesis between 2007 and 2020, and summing
up everything he did for Genesis would take up more space than Gorboth's
yearly State of the Donut posts (and they were LOOOONG). Gorboth was 
the Keeper that kept the game running during Genesis' darkest hour, 
when you sometimes would find yourself being the ONLY player awake.
Sad times, but Gorboth was the driving force for a much needed
modernization that eventually led to a rebirth for one of the oldest
online games that is still running. Without Gorboth, the text you
are reading now may not have existed. Set a trigger to *bow* next time
you see him, because he has promised to stick around, and will hopefully
continue to create awesome content for Genesis for years to come.

Surprise! He is back as AoE. I guess this means he is coding again and
doing things for the game. Let's hope so! Don't let him near the couch.
