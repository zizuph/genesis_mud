Elessar Telcontar is renowned for his interest in the world of Tolkien.
This interest led him to found the domain of Gondor, and become its
first Liege (Lord, in those ancient days). After passing on the mantle
of supervision to other worthies, Elessar is now a Mage, a title
given to him for his superlative efforts and contributions over the
years.
