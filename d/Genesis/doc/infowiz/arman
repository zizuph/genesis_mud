Administrative position: Archwizard of Balance (AoD)

An avid content creator for the Dragonlance domains of Krynn and Ansalon, 
Arman is responsible for the creation of the dwarven Neidar Clan, Dragonarmies,
the Elven Archers, the Bloodsea Minotaurs, the Throtyl Raiders, the Mariners, 
the School of High Magic, and the Wizards of High Sorcery... as well as
global fishing!

He was the Arch of Balance for many years, then served a while as Arch
of Domains, and now he's back as Arch of Balance. Guess he just loves
reviewing stuff!
