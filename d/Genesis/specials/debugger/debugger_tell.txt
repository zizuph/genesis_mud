                    Debugger Tell Object
                    ====================
                    
Introduction
------------
Since LPC doesn't have a true debugger, the best way to tell what's going
on in the code is by having the code send out messages to the person who
is looking into the code. This debugger tell object was written to allow
that process to be quick and easy.

Basic Concepts
--------------
The concept is simple. Within any code that you write, you can call a
function called "send_debug_message". You associate a "tag" to the message.
Anyone who has the debugger tell object and listens to that tag will
receive the debug messages being sent by the code. A person can now also
optionally listen to a particular file (both master object and instance)
and all send_debug_message calls from that file will get sent to the
debugger.

How to Use in Code
------------------
The header for the debugger tell is currently in:
    /d/Genesis/specials/debugger/debugger_tell.h

In order for your code to use it, all you need to do is include this file
in your own file. eg.
   #include "/d/Genesis/specials/debugger/debugger_tell.h"
       
Within your code, to use this to send debug messages, simply call:

    send_debug_message(tag, message, logfile)

For example, if I want to send a debug message with the "LIBRARY" tag,
I can do this by calling like this:

    send_debug_message("LIBRARY", "This is a test.")

Anyone with a debugger object listening to the "LIBRARY" tag will
receive this message.                    

How to Use the Debugger Object
------------------------------
Debugger Object can be cloned: /d/Genesis/specials/debugger/debugger_tell.c

The Debugger Object receives all messages that are sent out by code, but
will only display the ones that you want to listen to. To see what is
avaliable to you, you can do "list available". If you want to see
what files sent out a particular tag, you can do "showfiles <tag>".
Using this information, you should be able to add the list of tags
and files that you want. Below are the commands on the debugger object.
You can get this also by simply examining it.

list tags          - Shows the tags you're listening to
list files         - Shows the files you're listening to
list available     - Shows all the available tags you can listen to
addtag <tagname>   - Adds a new tag to listen to
remtag <tagname>   - Removes a tag from listening
addfile <filename> - Adds a new file to listen to
remfile <filename> - Removes a file from the listen list
showfiles <file>   - Show the list of files that a particular tag has.
