The Delivery Offices                                             Aridor, 05/95
====================

Motivation
----------
 The offices intention is to provide a way for newbies to earn money. At the
same time the newbie will travel the world and learn his way around.
The idea is to have offices spread over all of Genesis.

Introducing players to the offices
----------------------------------
 The questmaster in Solace is giving out a tour which is to find the delivery
office in Newports. The tour card will explain that this office is a means to
earn money.

How the offices work
--------------------
 Each (open) domain has one or more offices, which should be located as far
from each other as possible. Each office must be in a fairly easily accessable
place. Every office has a name which identifies the office completely.
'the Shop in Solace', 'Newports in Krynn'. If the city or area the office is
located in is widely known among players, it's not necessary to give the
domain name (like Solace, or even Sparkle).

Commands
--------
 There are three commands for the players in each office. 'Ask', 'Deliver' and
'Return'. 'Ask for a delivery tour' will give the player a packet and tell
what destination the packet must be taken to. 'Deliver' will deliver a packet
at its destination and the player receives payment for it. The 'return' command
is there to return packets which are not correctly delivered.

Destinations
------------
 Upon receiving a packet from an office, the destination is selected randomly.

Limitations
-----------
 Each player may only receive one packet at a time. Should someone find a
packet somewhere, he can of course deliver that packet, too. A packet may not
be 'returned' at the office it came from. Each office has only a limited number
of packets to give out each reset.

Payments
--------
 There are two zones of delivery, within a domain and between two domains. The
first zone will of course be faster to deliver, but give less money than the
second. The amount of money depends on the time taken to deliver a packet only
after a certain time has passed already.
Current payments are: 24(12)sc within domain, 72(36)sc across domains.
Numbers in () are if the delivery took too long.

Implementation
--------------
 There are some files in /d/Genesis/delivery/ which are the delivery master
who stores general things and also does the calculations necessary. The
office.c file is the base file which must be inherited into each office in
Genesis. This file provides the commands for the players. Check out the
example_office.c to see how easy it is to use. There is currently only a
standard packet to be delivered between offices. Should there ever be other
packets allowed for delivery, it must be insured that they are worth nothing
or at least have the NO_SELL property set.

/d/<domain>/open/delivery.c
---------------------------
Each domain which has delivery offices must have this file. Look at
/d/Krynn/open/delivery.c to see the syntax. This file tells the master
object which delivery offices there are. From this list of all offices in all
domains the master object picks one each time a new packet is given out.
IF an office is reported to the master this way, it must exist and function.
Otherwise players will arrive at the office with a packet and be unable to
deliver it!
The syntax for each office is:
-Name of the office                a string to uniquely identify this office
-giveout/recieve identifier        a number: 0 send and receive packets,
                                             1 send only,
                                             2 receive only.
-offices to send to                0 or an array of office names, this option
                                             should rarely be used!
-offices not to send to            0 or an array of office names, use this
                                             option if two offices are located
                                             fairly close to each other.
