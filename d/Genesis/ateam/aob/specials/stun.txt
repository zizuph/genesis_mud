Stun prevents the stun victim from attacking and invoking specials.
The standard special lib stun prevents attacks during some interval
and the victim cannot be re-stunned by the standard lib stun
objects while the standard stun effect is in cooldown.

Different effects can stack and the library code handles the
stacking.

Like evade the CAID is calculated via the amount of potential
damage prevented.

caid = 100 / (100 - stun percentage of cycle interval) * 100 - 100

For example:

A 25% CAID stun with a 60 second cycle time, should incapacitate
the victim 20% of the time (12 seconds) every 60 seconds.

A 65% CAID stun with a 60 second cycle time, should incapacitate
the victim 39% of the time (23 seconds) every 60 seconds.

If the stun attempt can miss, we would adjust the percentage to
account for the CAID difference.

While one-on-one, stun is roughly equivalent to evade at preventing
attacks, because stun is an active ability rather than passive
ability it is not as effective as evade at preventing attacks when
tanking multiple enemies. We usually have setup and cooldown
periods in the special. For example Monks plexus, we can
only actively administer up to 4 stuns overlapping stuns on 4
different enemies simultaneously. Whereas evade would apply to
all enemy attacks at all times no matter how many enemies and
does not incur a start up cost. However, unlike evade stun prevents
special damage including magic (for stunnable casters).
