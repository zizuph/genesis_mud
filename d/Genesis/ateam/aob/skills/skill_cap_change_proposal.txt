THE ISSUE WITH OCCUPATIONAL GUILD SKILL CAP
In reviewing the skill limitations of both the rogue classes,
(rangers and thieves) it has become patently clear that they are 
considerably disadvantaged due to the practical requirement of
needing alien skill types to be functional, resulting in 
thematic skill sacrifices which are ultimately undesirable from
guild uniqueness and diversity point of view.

The combat and magic system rely on 'Fighter' and 'Mage/Cleric'
skills respectively, making them functional skills in gaining
experience in Genesis.

For thieves, and to a great extent rangers, having all functional
skills classed as alien means that for them to be a reasonable
playing experience they need to necessarily pay a premium for 
a minimum of alien skill types, to the detriment of their class
skills... so you'll find occasions where thieves/rangers will 
have low or limited thief/ranger skills - in particular those 
skills with least utility but high thematic relevance such as
SS_ACROBAT, SS_FR_TRAPS, and thematic ranger skills such as
SS_HUNTING, SS_TRACKING, SS_LOCATION_SENSE, or SS_ANI_HANDL.

These sort of limitations do not provide Wizards with the scope
to provide fun, playable occupational options for the rogue
guild types - to the detriment of style diversity in Genesis.

So it is proposed the way skills are capped and taxed for guild
styles is changed slightly as described below.

INTRODUCING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SKILL TYPES
The type of skills a guild can train without penalty as an alien
skill are referred to here as as 'primary' skills, and is 
determined by guild class.

(Proposed change to allowable skills for guild styles highlighted 
with *.)

UNCHANGED:
The skill cap for occupational guilds remains 550.

For the guild styles on the polar end of the skill spectrum 
(fighter, mage, cleric), skills alien to the guild style will
still be offered only in a very limited way. Skills alien to 
the guild style count twice towards the sum of levels which 
the guild may offer *above* the limits in 'man skills' 
(you do not apply this penalty to the taxation of the skills 
which are alien). This principle for guild skills remains 
unchanged from how things work now.

CHANGED:
In the past, the 'ranger' style would have access to all skill 
types up to level 75, and then a 4x skill penalty for all skill 
levels over 75. 
That is no longer the case. While they have few primary skill
types, they have access to a large range of secondary skills,
and only suffer the standard 2x alien skill penalty (see
secondary skill list below).

The SS_MISSILE skill is no longer an alien skill for the ranger
style. The SS_KNIFE skill is no longer an alien skill for the
thief style (seems strange SS_BACKSTAB is a thief-specific skill
but knife is an alien skill!).

Awareness will now be a thief/ranger specific skill, no longer 
a general skill meaning fighter/mage/cleric classes will
need to factor this in as an alien skill to their skill cap.

While SS_BACKSTAB is a mudlib skill for the purposes of taxation 
it is considered in the same way as a 'special skill', with its 
combat aid taxed as outlined in the standardised backstab special 
/d/Genesis/specials/std/backstab.c. While skill points do
not count towards a guild's skill maximum, layman guilds should
not offer more than 60 levels in this skill and make sure backstab
is counted towards their combat aid cap.

Occupational Rogue classes (thief/ranger) have a bit more 
flexibility in the proposed new system in accessing alien skills 
due to the utility importance of combat and magic skills in Genesis. 
They can train 'secondary' skills up to a maximum without a penalty 
counting towards their total skill points:

Secondary Skill                 Style      Unpenalised skill max   
================================================================
SS_WEP_SWORD           (0)      Ranger             75     
SS_2H_COMBAT          (20)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_BLIND_COMBAT       (22)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_PARRY              (23)      Ranger/Thief       75
SS_DEFENCE            (24)      Ranger/Thief       75   
SS_SPELLCRAFT         (30)      Ranger             75
SS_ELEMENT_*          (xx)      Ranger             75
SS_FORM_*             (xx)      Ranger             75
SS_HERBALISM          (36)      Ranger/Thief       70
SS_ALCHEMY            (37)      Ranger/Thief       70


For rogue class skills (those that are a 'thief/ranger' or 'thief 
only' primary skill) only half of the skill levels count towards 
an occupational thief/ranger guild skill cap (so for 80 points of 
pick pockets, only 40 would count towards the 550 cap).

Further, to support the 'jack of all trade' philosophy of the
ranger class only half of the points from 'general' skills count
towards a ranger's skill maximum cap.
