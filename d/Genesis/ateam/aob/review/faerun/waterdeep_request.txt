Balance Review Request Submission
---------------------------------

Request Date: 6-10-2019
1. What are you requesting to be reviewed?

The Dock Ward neighborhood of Waterdeep, as well as a little bit of South Ward.

2. Please list all files for review, as well as the location of any
documentation describing the submission.

3. Describe the benefits that players receive by interacting with your
submission.

I'm hoping this will be some fun end game content for players. The NPCs are
large, hopefully large enough to get people out of GK once in a while. There
are some new quests, for those who like questing, as well as some new weapons
and armours. Eventually, I'll open other neighborhoods in Waterdeep and maybe,
just maybe, Waterdeep will finally come to Genesis.

4. Describe the thematic justification for the benefits that the player
will receive.

Waterdeep is a major part of Faerun. Dockward itself is the most famous
(infamous?) neighborhood in the City. Hopefully I've done it justice. It is a
gritty area, on the docks, in a major city. As you'd expect, things can get a
bit crude.

5. Describe the downsides that the player will experience that justify
the balance of the submission.
I'm hoping there won't be too many downsides.

6. How has the submission been tested to ensure that balance is maintained?
If no testing has been done, how can the AoB team help with this
testing?

Tomas and I have played around with our juniors. Things seem to be in order.
However, the numbers should be looked at. Are NPCs too big (or for that matter
too small) for end game content? Are items too powerful/weak? Are there too
many items? Too few? Are the quest rewards balanced for the effor the quests
take? (We did compare the rewards of these quests to ones in the Shire and
tried to keep things consistent.) I'm ammenable to making changes as needed.

7. Other Comments / Questions
A) Cotillion was kind enough to give some feedback
(/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/cotillion_notes.md). I have made a | where I have
fixed the issues he noticed.

B) You probably already know, but this is my first area (and the first code
I've written since 1998), so hopefully I didn't mess anything up too badly.

C) It's summer and I'll be on the road for a while. I'm not sure how much I'll
log in over the next month or two. I will respond as soon as I'm able to any
questions or concerns. I did, however, want to get this submitted before my
trip.
