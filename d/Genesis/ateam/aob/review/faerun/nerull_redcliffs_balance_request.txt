The long description doesn't really portray the epicness
of the battle this would be for the player. A 30,000 hitpoint
boss is incredible... the description should at least convey
the level of challenge.
 
line 85:  typo... 'site' should be 'sight'

line 107: set_attacked_unarmed for teeth have a hit and pen of 0;

Some issues with how you have set up the construct's attacks:

The massive steel construct cuts your body with its mind.

line 120: typo 'fasion' should be 'fashion'. Note that this golem doesn't 
have hands but claws?

lines 125-130: the cacts don't really reflect the sort of emotes you'd
expect from a mechanical construct. Consider revising.

line 134: set_exp_factor((100) * (1 + DAMON_MINIMUM_TEAMSIZE));
So an exp factor of 300%... Exp at kill: 82167 at 100%

lines 157-170: you have two functions that do the same thing... arm_me and
spawn_chest... doesn't look like you use the former so can you delete this
function?

lines 231-234: I don't understand the logic behind the construct self
healing when the team leader isn't in the room... can this be 
explained? 

What is the reasoning behind limiting the content to myths only?
The way the challenge looks from the code is that it is hard coded
so that only myths can do it, not because it is too difficult for
non-myths to do it?  I like the idea of team content... but i'd rather
it force teaming through the challenge rather than hard coding team
limits?

lines 318-321: Again, this messaging doesn't make me think 'golem' or
'construct'... cackling seems out of place. Can we change the messaging
so that it better reflects that this creature is an animaton?

line 337:  Carnak - is this hit_me ok?


>>> /d/Faerun/red_cliffs/obj/loot_chest.c
A lot of duplicated functions that you don't really need for the chest.
Seems to result in random bugs... like double description of the 
chest being closed:

An old batter chest made of wood.
The chest is closed.
It is closed.

set_pick(random(40))... for a chest holding epic or legendary items,
this chest is remarkably easy to pick. I think this chest needs to be
unpickable.

For gem spawns can we use the random functions defined in 
/d/Genesis/gems/gem.h e.g. RANDOM_GEM_BY_RARITY(GEM_EXTREMELY_RARE)


>>> /d/Faerun/red_cliffs/rooms/islands/isl04_01

Magic mapping needs to be added to all rooms.

The rooms around this island provide no indication that there is an
island a room away. Can that be tidied up? Haven't checked the rest of
the sea yet but it is something that needs to be included for all islands.

>>> /d/Faerun/red_cliffs/drop_loot_dir/e_3_2*
As default drops, these are ok rewards for the challenge noting that 
while they are magical they are two-handed with reasonable hit/pen with
a nice speed buff.  If they become too common we may need to think about
reducing the speed bonus... but otherwise I am fine with it.

For the epic weapons i'd like a bit of variability across hit, pen and
quickness... be creative, so for example with the two-handed sword 
something like a = random(6), hit = 50 + a; pen = 50 - a; 
quickness = 40 + (a * 2).

I note there is no knife or bow in the mix. Can we add those as possible
epic/legendary spawns? And if a bow spawns, maybe some top quality arrows 
in a quiver... they don't exist in the game currently. Good opportunity 
to include.

>>> /d/Faerun/red_cliffs/drop_loot_dir/l_3_*

The hit/pen values of these legendary weapons exceed the maximum allowable
for one-handed weapons. See 'man weapon'. Either reduce to 50/50 or 
make two-handed.

*** Carnak can you check these weapons  special attacks? How reasonable 
are they?

I am not keen on weapons that have the cap hit/pen that have a special
attack also be unbreakable / uncorrodeable. I think if it is a weapon
with a 'special' like quickness or damage it should dull.
