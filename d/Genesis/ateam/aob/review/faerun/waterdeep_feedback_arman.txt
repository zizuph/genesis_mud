============================================================

Too many references to Dragonlance themes throughout the code. 
Faerun is a domain based on the Forgotten Realms, so you should 
be avoiding references to things like kenders or Takhisis 
(Dragonlance) or hobbits and wraith-actors spouting 'Fail 
Melkor' (Tolkien). You have to stick with the domain theme, 
which is rich with its own lore... so that shouldn't be a 
problem.

Love that Selune's Smile is at the docks! A nice nod to the
Forgotten Realms comics. A personal favourite!

The majority of npcs are over-rewarding for their challenge with
high coin and gear reward. Based on a review using Cotillion's 
exp_formula tool, we are finding a lot of the npcs are over-
rewarding by a considerable xp factor, with the main ones being:

Easy and high rewarding in both experience and loot is a bad
combination - particularly for myth-sized npcs. There has to be
an appropriate challenge for such a reward, and it is generally
not being achieved with this area. In some cases 196 stat
average npcs carrying equipment worse than the mistform starter
weapons (like /d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/wep/r_axe_4.c with
a hit/pen of 5/12). Or a 262 stat average npc wielding a 20/20
belay pin. It just doesn't pass the pub test. The gearing and
stats of the majority of the npcs need a re-think.

Specific file comments:
============================================================
Dockwards magic map:

Pelargir is spelt incorrectly.

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/bakery.c

Pricelist has the pie listed as 1000cc, actual buy price is 500cc.
With /d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/obj/food/pie.c having an actual 
value of 1000cc, this opens up one avenue for a buy-sell abuse.

Typo in long description, couner should be counter.

add_item has a grammatical error:
"The counter is made of maple. It's been polished to a bright shine, 
and is covered display cases."

Should be covered 'in' or 'with' display cases.

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/dock_s3

Isn't linked to the magic map.

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/dock_s6

Isn't linked to the magic map.

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/obj/food/brownies.c
Typo in long description. Missing a full stop:

"...doesn't look like much It's a little jagged on the edges.."

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/dock_s2

Typo in sign add_item:
"This is a lare pole with a sign on it." lare should be large.

What you examine the sign it says:
"There is a sign attached to it." Doesn't really make sense
seeing you just examined it. Perhaps change it to
"There is a sign attached to it you can read."

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/arm/c_bracers_poor_magic.c

The speed penalty feels excessive for simply being rusty?
It drops you to "You are moving at a very relaxed pace."
-100?

If they are non-magical, they shouldn't have     
add_prop(OBJ_I_IS_MAGIC_ARMOUR, 1) set, or magic id info.
Considering how frequently these would be cloned, this could
be an easy way for warlocks to abuse to get their magic
item tally up.

The messaging when worn and removed should actually be clear
you have worn and removed them. Right now it just says a 
message like 'These bracers are stiff and hard to move in.'

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/wep/shortsword.c

Illegal hit value.

The hit value of 35 + random(5) means in most cases it will
exceed the maximum cap of 35 for a non-magical one handed 
weapon.

Refer to 'man weapon' (/doc/man/general/weapon) for rules
around weapon creation.

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/npcs/city_watchwoman.c

For an npc with relatively poor weapons and no specials, 
the stats (and therefore experience reward) is too high.

Awareness is quite low at 30. Considering they carry almost
7 gold each, it is a low risk high reward for even 
novice thieves. This level of awareness doesn't really align
with a "watch" guard either... so thematically seems
too low.

Blindfighting is really low (40). Combined with their poor 
weapons these enemies are easily countered by darkness
and night vision.

Also noting that most of these npcs tend to have a speed
penalty due to largely defaulting to having 
c_bracers_poor_magic.c, they really are too easy.

Based on Cotillion's exp_formula tool, this npc offers
58% too much experience for its challenge.

Creatures at around the myth level should be as much a
challenge as they are rewarding. This is too rewarding
for high level characters, and will only result in more
stat inflation. 

Suggested maximum stat average for these guards should be
150 (including the random factor). Considering the coinage
carried, suggest increase awareness by a random factor of
50 to add some risk to thievery (and more reason to use
abilities that check the awareness of a foe).

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/npcs/bar_sailor.c

Faerun is Forgotten Realms themed. It shouldn't be referencing
Dragonlance... kender aren't a thing. Thematically the sailors
shouldn't have tattoos of kender on their arm. Try and stick
to the theme of the domain. 

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/npcs/ruffian-warehouse.c

As with previous comments, you need to make sure the npc 
challenge matches the reward. Having an npc the size of a
myth with weapons as bad as newbie knives like the pitted
iron hatchet (hit/pen 5/12) really isn't appropriate.

Based on Cotillion's exp_formula tool, this npc offers
661% too much experience for its challenge.

------------------------------------------------------------
/d/Faerun/waterdeep/dockward/arm/b_glasses_*

With an ac of zero, using the weight formulas in:
add_prop(OBJ_I_WEIGHT, F_WEIGHT_DEFAULT_ARMOUR(ac, BOD_TYPE));
add_prop(OBJ_I_VOLUME, F_WEIGHT_DEFAULT_ARMOUR(ac, BOD_TYPE) / 5);

results in a weight and volume of zero. Don't use the formula.
Set a weight and volume factor for zero ac items.
