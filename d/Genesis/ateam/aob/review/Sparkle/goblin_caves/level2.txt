Hello,

I've checked through most of the area and it's looking good.
There are a few issues that need to be taken care of though.

Some are nice to have but the stuff under balance must be done
before opening.

General code quality:
	- Indentation (spaces not tabs)
	- Object references in commands:
	  command("drop " + ob->query_short()) -> command("drop " + OB_NAME(ob)
	  
	- String function names are obsolete
	  set_alarm(1.0,0.0,"reject_flower",ob); -> set_alarm(1.0, 0.0, &reject_flower(ob));
	  
	- this_player() after set alarm is not reliable, it may point at noone or sometimes at
	  someone else.
	
	  set_alarm(1.0,0.0,"accept_gem",ob);
	  
	  void
	  accept_gem(object ob) 
      {
        command("thank " + TP->query_name());
		
	  Should be:
	  
	  set_alarm(1.0, 0.0, &accept_gem(ob, from));
	  
	  void 
	  accept_gem(object ob, object player) { 
	    command("thank " + OB_NAME(player))
	
	- Command parsing
	  All command parsing needs to be improved to handle more variants.
	  Preferably using something like parse_command.
	  
	  At a miminum 'the' needs to be handled.
	

Balance

		set_am, see man armour for rules
	
	Dart Quest
		As this is only pure luck and stats this does not merit such a large reward.
		Something like:
		500 QXP for playing
		1000 QXP for the high score
		
		Declare the sectors variable static, so it's not saved in all save files.
		
	Love Quest
		5000 is borderline for this, but ok.
