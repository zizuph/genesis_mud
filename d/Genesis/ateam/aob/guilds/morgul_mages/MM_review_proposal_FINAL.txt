Morgul Mage review proposal, Arman Kharas (AoB) - December 2018
==========================================================================

CONTEXT:
========
The Morgul Mages are currently an evil spellcaster guild that occupies the
occupational and layman guild slot. Thematically based on the Nazgul of
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and conceptually positioned to be
powerful and feared undead spellcasters capable of vastly destructive 
capabilities.

They were the first guild to be transferred over to the standardised magic
system, and currently suffer from an immature structural set up that 
doesn't reflect the intent of changes made to the guild.

The primary issue is due to the importance element magic skills play in 
determining damage output of harm spells. The morgul mages are set up to
leverage an at-will fire spell to support them in their apprentice ranks
and for their higher level mages to use while regaining mana. Fire is not
their primary element, capping out at level 50 for full mages and level 20
for apprentices, resulting in a gross reduction in the damage output for
the combat aid applied to the at-will spell.

Another primary issue is damage output for mana cost. While on paper the
Morgul Mages have an incredibly powerful harm spell, its fast cast time
results in a good damage-per-second output but a really poor perceived
damage output for its static mana cost. Harm spells scale damage upwards
as cast time increases, so the most mana efficient harm spells are those
that have a long cast time. The Morgul Mages have no variability in harm
spell duration, and have a spell duration that is comparatively inefficient
to other magic guilds. This is compounded due to their skills (spellcraft,
a major contributor to mana regeneration, is capped at superior master)
and their undead detriment of being unable to consume herbs that could
regenerate mana.

A secondary issue is that a large proportion of caid sits with one offensive
spell, morthul. For those yet to achieve that spell, they are very limited
in what they are capable of doing. For apprentices, combined with their
poor skilling, they are less effective and self sufficient than a cadet.

So some proposed changes are outlined below to improve the player experience
of the Morgul Mages, with a particular focus on the playability at the lower
levels, and to bring the Morgul Mages in line with the more recently
coded magic guilds in Genesis.

SUMMARY CHANGES:
================

* Update skill levels to support spell effectiveness within the 
  standardised spell system
* Revise spell acquisition to better support apprentice mages
* Apprentice mages are converted to occupational only
* Full mages are occ + lay
* With death resistance stacking making MM spell countering overly simple,
  provide alternate harm spell options that apply different damage resists.
* Remove transmutation skills (no spells use it)
* Some illusion spells convert over to enchantment (gostangwedh, faugoroth)
* Remove spell gorothnatha.
* NEW SPELL Mortirio - standard see in dark spell (team support).
* NEW SPELL Thunaur Harm, 2.5 cast time, caid range from 140 - 240, damage 
  type fire.
* NEW SPELL Mordonaer Harm, 1.5 cast time, caid mirrors morthul, damage 
  type illusion.
* UPGRADE Ringurth from 50 caid to 80 caid, change from conjuration to 
abjuration.
* REVISE Dramalgos Harm, 0.75 cast time, caid range from 140 - 240.
* REVISE Naro spells to be split out into three separate spells and 
  standardised:
  - drego nin: based on the turn spell base
  - libo makil: based on disarm spell base (40 caid?)
  - maetho: keep as is.. not sure what caid to apply.
* Can't cast an alternative naro while another is in effect.
* REVISE Morthul to be castable with ringurth, with cast time changed from 
  1x to 1.5x
* Propose making the undead shadow a global shadow rather than guild
  specific. So would apply to all 'undead' player types and guilds.

Max caid is 325 for occ+lay.

Morthul has a max caid dependent on whether mortirio (20), naro (55), and 
faugoroth (50) are active.

Thunaur / dramalgos have a max caid dependent on whether ringurth (80)
and mortirio (20) is active or not.

Only one 'naro' type spell can be maintained at any one time.

Ringurth or turniawath can be maintained at any one time.

Sulambar is a restricted 'feature' spell, which is not included in the 
caid calculations.

HIGHEST COMBINED AID = 
morthul (245) + ringurth/turniawath (80)
thunaur/dramalgos (240) + naro (55) + faugoroth (50)


Morgul mages are undead, adding the 'undead' shadow to them with the 
benefits and disadvantages that come with it. This is viewed as a global 
feature in the same way race is and does not count towards caid caps.

=======================================================================
Undead benefits:
=======================================================================
* UNDEAD 
In addition to the normal spells and skills, the mages are also proper
undead, which means they suffer some drawbacks as well as positive benefits,
that largely cancel each other out. As such, no additional tax is payed for
the undead effect.
   Positive
   - Cannot drown (Avenir and Calia drown objects)
     Implemented by the MAGIC_I_BREATH_WATER property
   - Immunity to poisons (100% resistance to poison element)
   - Natural Darkvision
   - No fatigue
   - Healing from Death Spells (negative energy heals undeads)
   - Cannot be stunned (implemented in mudlib)
 
   Negative
   - Damage from Healing Spells (healing harms undeads)
   - Cannot eat or drink (or at least not gain the effects of
     either, herbs included)
   - Vulnerability to Life spells (effect amplification, 10-20%)

CAID
   - Cannot drown (0 caid)
   - Immunity to poisons (100 caid)
   - Perma darkvision (20 caid+)
   - Healing from death spells (0 caid)
   - Does not fatigue
   - Cannot be stunned (? caid?)

   - Vulnerability to life spells (-20 caid)
   - Damage from healing spells (0 caid)
   - Cannot eat (caid detriment as that they don't benefit from herbs)
   - Cannot drink (~-14 caid healing disadvantage)
