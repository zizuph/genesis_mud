>>> I am comfortable with the skill levels of branches until the racial skills
>>> get added on top.  Those additional levels just make the branches feel
>>> really unbalanced, in particular with the alien skills.
>>>
>>> The defence skills combined with the defensive spells make the guild very
>>> tanky for most branches, even before you take into account healing ability. 
>>> Skills up around 80-90 in defence/parry/weapon skill is too high when  
>>> combined with 350% combat aid. The drawbacks for the class just aren't there.
>>> 
>>> So looking at comparative guilds - Morgul mages have defence 60, sword 50,
>>> and knife 40; PoT have defence 64, parry 34, club 64; SoHM have defence
>>> 45 only; WoHS have defence 60 and knife 60.  All have some form of spell
>>> that boosts a skill/s to varying degrees of proficiencies to improve
>>> guild playability (i.e. narusse for MM, pHammer for PoT, enchant weapon
>>> for SoHM/WoHS), however that also costs them combat aid.  If you want
>>> skill levels up around what is outlined in the occ+lay+racial proposal,
>>> I suggest having a skill boost incorporated into skiamorfi or a new 
>>> standalone spell.
>>>
>>> As far as base skill levels, what i'd feel comfortable with is base melee
>>> and defence skill at a maximum of 70, parry at 40. Then +10 to +15 points
>>> to split across those three skills depending on branch speciality... such
>>> as Fire branch +15 club; Earth +15 defence; air +5 club, +10 parry; Water
>>> +5 parry, +10 defence; Spirit +5 club, +5 parry, +5 defence. Or something
>>> along those lines. Then incorporate into the skiomorfi spell (or a new spell
>>> a defence, parry, and melee skill bonus of something like +10... so 30 points..
>>> which is calculated by the other guild to be something like 15% combat
>>> aid. 

>>>>> After doing some testing with Genea i'd question whether you even needed
>>>>> a spell to enhance melee skills. Air and Earth are incredible tanks with 
>>>>> defensive skills set at 75/45 for air and 80/40 for earth (def/parry). 
>>>>> Fire branch is the one likely to struggle more than the others to tank,
>>>>> but are still capable soloers (if not optimal). But then they are the
>>>>> offensive branch, and more a 'glass cannon' playstyle. Anyway let's discuss.

>>>
>>> One other thing i'd like to flag with melee weapon skills such as club, they
>>> are wasted on spellcasters where their primary damage output is harm or
>>> at will harm spells. While preparing spells, white damage is removed from
>>> the caster... that removal of damage is incorporated into the harm damage
>>> formula. This means spellcasters using their spells rarely do white damage
>>> with their weapons. An EC chaining harm spells will do no white damage with
>>> their club (literally), so weapon skills will have questionable value to the
>>> guild.

ELEMENTAL CLERICS SPELLS DESCRIPTION AND BREAKDOWN
==================================================

Some of the spells below require ritual components to be made. 
These are created in the ritual chamber of the temple and require
two ingredients each to make them. The first ingredient is either
a herb or leftover. The second ingredient is a gem shard (these
can be created by crushing gems in the equipment room (this
generates 2 + random(2) shards from each gem crushed) or Earth
branch clerics can smash gems into shard using a spell (this
generates whatever the base spell generates for each gem
shattered - currently 2 +random(6) shards).

Once placed in the ritual chamber, the player will perform
the appropriate ritual for the spell (based on the spell name)
or the Diety name) and it will generate 2 + random(2) ritual 
components.

For tax calculations, I have used the mid point (due to the 
randomness of random) of the best case scenario (Earth cleric
shattering the gems for the highest yield possible per gem).
I will take the total cost of the first ingredient (herb or
leftover) and divide that by 3 (mid-point of that possible 
outcome). I will take the total cost of the second ingredient
(gem) and divide that by 5 (mid-point of that possible outcome).
I will then add both of those costs together and divide that
by 3 (mid-point of that possible outcome) to come up with an
average cost of the component per casting.

For spells that require components, I will list the ingredients
needed and the average cost per component in the list below.

>>> I am ok with the approach above, noting that it is a more
>>> thematic version of the potion, and the gem component is 
>>> essentially a buyable resource with there being a restocking
>>> lapidary in the guild halls.
>>>
>>> I believe the lapidary is publically accessible, however if it
>>> isn't it will need to be taxed.
>>>
>>> The herbal component is the key part of ensuring EC spells
>>> meet the component drawback requirement. Looking at it, each
>>> branch requires one type of herb to make their components,
>>> either : fireweed, chicory, sargassum, cladina, or drakeroot.
>>> Would we say they are of equal rarity/commonality?
>>>
>>> Also, does only having one component for each branch make it
>>> harder for them? I don't think fireweed is terribly common..
>>> not sure about sargassum or drakeroot. May be worth having
>>> two rituals - a ritual requiring a common herb that can be
>>> used for frequent use spells (harms / heals), and then the
>>> less common herb (like fireweed) for the spells that are
>>> maintained spells?

================================================================
                         =============
                         Master Spells
                         =============
================================================================

Upgraded Child spells will require no components and will be
taxed at the 1.5% rate accordingly with one exception, Aleipso.
Aleipso at the Master rank and higher will cost a component
for the Fire, Air and Earth branches - Water and Spirit will
remain component free.

Master spells will start to require components if the spell 
doesn't fit your 'branch' style (i.e. damage for fire, healing
for water, etc...). If the spell does fit your branch (i.e.
a damage spell for the fire branch), it will not require a 
component and will be taxed at the 1.5% rate accordingly. If
the spell does not fit your branch (i.e. a healing spell for
the fire branch), it will require components and will be 
taxed accordingly.

The exception to this is the at-will spells, these will be
component free (they are really the only 'combat special'
that every branch gets) and will be taxed at the 1.5% rate.

                      = 0.375%
Special Description : This turns the caster into elemental form. This gives a 
                      minor aid to the caster in that their inventory of 
                      items is hidden from view (thieves can still steal from 
                      them though). It gives them LIVE_I_SEE_DARK value of 5.
                      If they are a member of the optional Racial guild,
                      it also gives them the ability to see invisible 
                      creatures as well as change the "form" they take.

                      the same cooldown as duration).

Special Description : This spell pounds (damages) the target's armour with 
                      a possibility it breaks (if it gets damaged enough). 
                      It also does damage to the target. This spell is 
                      earth branch only. This checks the armour to see
                      if it has MAGIC_I_MAGIC_RES and if so, reduces
                      the amount of damage it does to the armour.

Special Description : This spell summons a shadow wall that blocks a single 
                      exit. Undeads cannot move through this wall, anyone 
                      else can. It blocks the exit for a maximum of 54 
                      seconds. The actual time is calculated by the 
                      casters SS_SPELLCRAFT, SS_ELEMENT_LIFE and 
                      SS_FORM_CONJURATION skills 
                      (MIN(54, SS_SPELLCRAFT + SS_ELEMENT_FIRE + 
                      SS_FORM_CONJURATION)).
		      The caster cannot cast this spell for 30 seconds once
		      it is cast and they cannot cast it if an existing 
		      wall is still in place. This spell is spirit branch 
		      only.

Special Description : This spell can have a blacklist of rooms that players 
                      can't teleport to (namely guild halls, places they 
                      shouldn't be, etc...). Right now it uses the base
                      teleport spell which takes a lot of that into 
                      consideration already. This spell is air branch only.

##
## I agree with the blacklist, which is why I put that in the comments. I would say
## that the blacklist should be put into the standard spell and be non-maskable so
## that it would apply to ALL teleport spells as I think they would all fall
## under that guideline as well.
##

                      cannot move through this wall. It blocks the exit for
                      10 seconds and then disappears. Each time someone 
                      tries to pass through the wall, the caster of the wall
                      gets an 'add_attack_delay(1,0)' added to them for 
                      having to concentrate to maintain the wall.

		      is still in place. This spell is fire branch only.

Upgraded Master spells will require components the same
components they had at the Master level (if the spell had
a component requirement).

The exception to this is the at-will spells, these will be
component free (they are really the only 'combat special'
that every branch gets) and will be taxed at the 1.5% rate.

component requirements and they will be listed below in the

Special Description : Each player gets 9 spells, the five of their 
                      element directly (e.g. fire/fire, fire/air,
                      fire/water, fire/earth, fire/spirit) plus the 
                      four from the opposing elements (e.g. air/fire, 
                      water/fire, earth/fire, spirit/fire). This really 
                      isn't a *spell*, it is a command that will be 
                      interpreted by the soul and determine which actual
                      *spell* (below) will be cast.

Special notes for Syndyasmos spells:
====================================
The code for casting these is in the lay_cleric_soul under the esyndyasmos routine. 
It checks to make sure that the caster has a partner set, that the partner is in the 
same room as the caster, that they are teamed with the partner, that both the caster 
and the partner have enough mana to cast the spell, that both the caster and the 
partner have enough Chymos (conduit energy) stored to cast the spell, that both the 
caster and the partner aren't already concentrating on something else (including 
spells being cast), that the caster hasn't already cast the spell and they aren't 
in Syndyasmos cooldown (30 seconds), and that the caster is already in combat. If 
all of those checks pass, it then removes the Chymos (conduit energy) from both the 
caster and the partner, it removes the mana from the partner, sets the flag that 
the caster has cast the spell (starts the cooldown) and then finally casts the
appropriate spell.

## Yes, I figured the duration would be too long but I thought I would

Special Description : This spell pounds (damages) all of one enemy's armour. 
                      It also does damage to the enemies. If armour is 
                      damaged enough, the armour can break. This checks the 
                      armour to see if it has MAGIC_I_MAGIC_RES and if so,
                      reduces the amount of damage it does to the armour.
                      NOTE: This uses the same cooldown prop as the Livra
                      prayer in order to prevent players from using both

>>> The branches I feel are now clearly distinguishable from each other

>>> Air defensive, Water healing, and Spirit more a balanced option

Fire Branch CAID:
=================

>>> Overall feel of the fire branch I think is quite good.
>>> From talking to the beta testers, it seems they are
>>> clearly the most powerful offensively but not strong
>>> defensively.  They are more a 'glass cannon' kind of
>>> option.
>>>
>>> Fire branch are doable solo but not optimal. Having said that
>>> players tend to still like to play high damage dealers so I 
>>> imagine this will be one of the more popular branches. And 
>>> they definitely shine in teams.
>>>
>>> Fire has good synergies with the other branches. Beta testers 
>>> Genea and Geneb played Fire and Earth options, and found they
>>> could easily hunt through all the big areas, rotating viloda
>>> and syndyasmos. I imagine that would be also the case with 
>>> Fire and Air.

>>> reduced to a level of what I outlined above.
>>>
>>> The schirmo air shield combined with apofevgo results in a very
>>> effect evade... this branch may be a better tank that Earth.
>>>>> Genea confirmed air is as good at tanking than Earth.
>>> They certainly didn't notice the defensive skill changes with
>>> their evades proccing constantly. Their dynami is the second
>>> most powerful, again supporting them as a good tanking option. 
>>>
>>> Offensively they are quite reasonable too, although noticeably
>>> slower than Fire branch. They seem a good solo option, probably
>>> ranking just below Spirit.

Water Branch CAID:
==================

>>> On balance I am not sure how popular this branch is going to be.
>>> Water will be a decent heal tank, and with unteristi and pano
>>> they will be the ultimate anti-magic tank.
>>> 
>>> In teams they'll be a great heal support, and their heal will  
>>> be a fantastic damage option against undead, so will smash through
>>> places like the Barrow Downs or Ghastly Keep.
>>>
>>> The downside is they don't have any real benefits over the other
>>> branches when it comes to melee defensive buffs, and their
>>> offensive spells are the weakest... so this branch will be the
>>> slowest grinding option in most circumstances. Was thinking
>>> maybe a 'blind' spell for water may be useful to balance things
>>> up, and lo! It had been added in the other version of the tax
>>> doc! ;) - Tyflos.  Only thing is the combat aid associated to
>>> it hasn't been included below... so you have some caid juggling
>>> to do ;).
>>>
>>> Blink caster behind target will be one appealing spell for the player
>>> who likes to play support.

Earth Branch CAID:
==================

>>> A powerful tanking option. Schirmo gu, impressive dynami,
>>> combined with aspida make Earth EC an impressive tank.
>>> Not as good as Neidar apparently, but Earth/Air EC would
>>> get a podium finish for tanking and also do a lot more
>>> damage to boot!
>>>
>>> Likely to be a popular option, although players will probably
>>> toss up the value of having either teleport spells with Air 
>>> or move target behind caster ability with Earth. So some 
>>> interesting choices for players!
>>>
>>> May want to consider re-balancing dynami with more a weighting
>>> towards con rather than strength. Strength isn't going to add
>>> anything of substance to their core function of tanking.
