> OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS OF THE AoB:
>
> There are a couple of principles for magic guilds that I feel aren't adequately
> addressed by the ECs... the main two being:
>
>*** PRINCIPLE 1:  The additional combat aid benefit that magic guilds have
>***               over other guilds needs to be balanced with appropriate
>***               drawbacks.
>
>*** PRINCIPLE 2:  At a minimum, occupational magic guilds drawbacks need to
>***               take into consideration mana usage, component requirements
>***               for their spells, and melee combat vulnerability.
>
> Lack of components for the majority of EC spells is a real issue in there being
> adequate drawbacks for a guild offering 3x the combat aid of a melee guild.
> Feedback from beta testers supports this.
>
> High melee skills (defence/parry/weapon skills) doesn't support Principle 2 for
> melee vulnerability. While in my mind melee vulnerability isn't a hard and fast
> rule, it feeds in to my next concern, which is distinction of the guild role.
>
> Five branches of EC with all having solid healing, harming, buffing, debuffing
> abilities, and good melee skills. There are no drawbacks of disadvantages for any 
> of the five branches. And the distinction between the five is also very minimal.
>
> I think these concerns outlined above can be overcome by being very clear about
> the themes of the five branches (e.g offensive, healing, debuff, buff etc) and 
> requiring standard component usage for spells outside of their speciality.
>
> Providing more of a combat aid range between the various five branches for heals
> vs harms could also provide more distinct roles while also make them feel less 
> like they can do everything well (i.e. having a lack of drawbacks).
>
>
> Another concern is poison spells. They were largely removed when the Morgul Mages
> were recoded as they were really hard to balance. I am finding that to be the same
> with the EC poison spells proposed. While some of the AoB team feel that we can
> come up with standardised formulas for poison spells, I just want to flag that it
> is unlikely this will be figured out quickly.

> Feedback from Arman:
>
> Just to be clear, max skill levels for awareness, club, parry and defence 
> are 60, 75, 45, and 65?  These skill levels are ok, although it does mean
> the EC's have minimal melee vulnerability... so to meet spellcasting guild
> drawback requirements that justify their extra combat aid, ECs need to 
> demonstrate they have appropriate drawbacks. 
>
> Also, I've allowed adventurers guilds to train SS_FORM_* skills to 
> level 20 to align with what is allowed for SS_ELEMENT_*, meaning you have 
> 100 skill level points freed up. I'd suggest spreading them across your

> Noting spellcasting success is 35% element skill, 35% form skill, it would

ELEMENTAL CLERICS SPELLS DESCRIPTION AND BREAKDOWN
==================================================

> Some general comments/requests:
>
> It would help me if we could also add under the Components section whether the
> spells have the following set, eg:
>        Peaceful: No; Stationary: Yes; Verbal: Yes; Visual: Yes.
>
> Also if we could add to this doc what standard spell base you used for the spell it would
> help me.
>
> Can I get some documentation on the ritual system that is essentially replacing ingredients?
> I note no spells use ingredients, however there are hooks in the spells relating to ritual
> components.  Having no spell components at all is a massive benefit. There is no downtime 
> for collection that other spellcasters need to do to cast their spells.
>
> Also, can you send me through any feedback you have from our beta testers? I'd like to read
> their impressions of how the guild works. I have already got a bit of feedback... one being
> all the different elemental types feel like they are all tanks. So branch distinction would
> be interesting to me.

> Going to have to review this spell more closely... it replicates a number

> standard spell objects though.
>
> Who can this target? Need to confirm it only targets the caster.
>  
>
> * Fire - grants a damage reflective shield
>      This one seems to only inherit the standard spell shadow object???
>      It doesn't look like this part of the spell is finished.
>
> * Water - grants regenerative healing shield (regeneration object)
> * Air - grants an evasive shield (evade object)
> * Earth - grants a damage absorbing shield (stoneskin object)
>      These three seem fine.
>
> * Spirit - grants regenerative mana shield (regeneration object, re-purposed for mana)
>
>      The justification for giving magic classes much higher combat aid than
>      other classes is that they can't sustain that level of output continuously.
>      At will spells were introduced to cover that gap with a max caid of 60 for occ
>      magic guilds.
>
>      Mana recovery spells were deliberately excluded as a spell option when Petros and
>      Nerull were creating spell templates. Any that we even consider we need to keep
>      the above principle in mind.
>
>      Having said all this, the SoHM have a mana regeneration spell which just about all
>      the members use. And the feedback i've got from a beta tester of this shield is that
>      this spell isn't as powerful as that one. 
>
>      So I am thinking we need to test this more thoroughly with our beta testers to work out
>      how much benefit it provides. And I think we need to make a base spell for mana regeneration
>      that other guilds (including the SoHM) use. It may need a bit of tweaking over time to make
>      sure that the Principles for magic guild mana drawbacks aren't bypassed.
>
>      So added to AoB TODO list is the creation of a magic regen base spell.

					  
Unteresti (Elemental Resistance)
================================
Effect              : Adds 25% combat aid worth of elemental resistance for
                      fire, earth, water, air, and death.
Element             : Primary Element (Earth, Fire, Air, Water, Spirit)
Form                : Abjuration
Acquire Level       : Child / 1 guild stat
Area of effect      : Caster
Spell Class Level   : Power 3 - Intermediate Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : 25% (Layman)
Tax                 : 0.75%

>
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC, 10);  // general
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE, 15);  // fire 
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_WATER, 15); // water
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_AIR, 15);   // air
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_EARTH, 15); // earth
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_DEATH, 15); // spirit - evil
>    add_resistance(MAGIC_I_RES_LIFE, 15); // spirit - good
>
>
>    I've had a think about this one and discussed it with the rest of the AoB team. 
>    I really don't like how caid is determined for resistance spells. One spell that 
>    provides MAGIC_I_RES_WATER 25 only pays the same combat aid as this one. 
>
>    I've decided that the determination of caid for resistance spells will be influenced
>    by how many form resistances are provided. So three MAGIC_I_RES_* forms, excluding MAGIC, 
>    would have a combat aid multiple of 1.0 for the purposes of working out total caid 
>    guild cap. Every additional form over is an extra x0.1 caid, while spells that have 
>    less forms get a caid reduction of 0.1, down to a x0.8 caid multiple...
>
>    MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC provides resistance to everything... so should have a x2 caid
>    multiple. 
>
>    So in using my new formula for determining resistance benefits, the caid for this spell
>    would be 15% x 1.3 for the 6 resistance types, plus 10% x 2.0 for RES_MAGIC... making
>    a total caid of 39.5%.
>
>    So have a think about how you want this spell to work and whether you want to limit the
>    resistance options or have a higher combat aid for this spell.

Aleipso (Lesser Heal)
=====================
Effect              : Restores lost HP or damage Undead
Element             : Water

Tax                 : None - Taxed based on full power below (see Aleipso 
                      (Major Heal) below)
Special Description : This spell is replaced by greater versions of itself as 
                      the player progresses in the guild.

>   An earlier reviewer noted the following:
>   set_spell_combat_aid(query_spell_combat_aid_modifier());
>
>   The preference is not to have a function within set_spell_combat aid.
>
>   Set the maximum combat aid for the spell with set_spell_combat_aid, and then modify it
>   through the query_spell_combat_aid_modifier() function. It is similar to what you are
>   doing so not a massive change.
>
>   An example is /d/Krynn/guilds/OotS/spells/oheal.c

Dynami (Stat Boosts)
====================
Effect              : Adds boost to Strength (10%/20%), Constitution (10%/20%), 
                      and Discipline (7.5%/15%).

Form                : Enchantment
Acquire Level       : Child / 1 guild stat
Area of effect      : Caster
Spell Class Level   : Power 3 - Intermediate Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : 30% or 60% (Layman)
Tax                 : 0.75%
Special Description : This spell has a 30% CAID (Strength 10%/Constitution 10%
                      /Discipline 7.5%) or 60% CAID (Strength 20%/Constitution
                      20%/Discipline 15%) - it scales depending on the
                      combination of the other buff spell (Evimero). If 
                      only this spell is active it is 60% CAID. If Evirmero 
                      spell is active they are each 30% CAID.

>   set_spell_target isn't set to spell_target_caster, as outlined in area of effect above.
>
>   The added stat bonus when at 30% caid as outlined in query_added_stat_boosts is
>   actually 10 / 10 / 10, not 10 / 10 / 7.5, as outlined above (likewise for the 60% caid
>   discipline is given a 20 bonus rather than a 15). Can we update this doc or the spell
>   to reflect the intended values?
>
>   Typos in the hook_no_ingredient_fail function.

CAID                : 30% or 60% (Layman)
Tax                 : 0.75%
Special Description : This spell has a 30% CAID (25% haste boost)
                      or 60% CAID (50% haste boost) - it scales 
                      depending on the combination of the other buff spell
                      (Dynami). If only this spell is active it is 60% CAID. 
                      If Dynami spell is active they are each 30% CAID.

>   set_spell_target isn't set to spell_target_caster, as outlined in area of effect above.
>
>   set_spell_combat_aid(query_spell_combat_aid_modifier());
>   As with apeipso, set the max combat aid within the spell config and then do all modifications
>   through query_spell_combat_aid_modifier() function.

                      /Kryo/Oxy/Ousia below)
Special Description : This spell is replaced by Enkav/Astrapi/Kryo/Oxy/Ousia 
                      below once player has reached Master Cleric rank and 
                      has selected a branch.

Special Description : NOTE: Cannot be cast in combat

>  According to sman set_spell_vocal, spells with vocal components can't be cast when
>  LIVE_M_MOUTH_BLOCKED property is true. (i actually want to test whether this is
>  the case... have we got any feedback from beta testers on this spell?)
>
>  This spell can therefore provide a stun that will affect spellcasters, which is  
>  combat aid, so shouldn't be classed as an emote.  If the purpose IS for it to be 
>  cosmetic, then I suggest that we change this spell so that the gag removes itself when 
>  the target enters combat, or we change it so that it initiates combat, and we allocate
>  combat aid to it.
>
>  10 + random(22) second dispel time is quite a long combat delay. A monk's plex
>  at 40% combat aid is around 8-10 seconds. As a once off cast (so combat initiator)
>  I think it is ok and would probably fit in around the 20% caid mark taking into account the
>  extended cast time? Still, I wonder if this is too powerful for a Child spell? 
>  (oh... and not suitable as a layman spell!)
>  
>  Can we add into check_valid_action that this can't be used against immortals.
>
>  I think we need to make a silence base spell based on the stun base spell. I'll add that
>  to the AoB TODO list.
>
>  Consider making this a more advanced spell for spirit branch only? It is very much an 
>  anti-caster spell... and would better suit one branch of the EC guild?

>  Learning someone's name is a pretty big deal. This spell doesn't have any 
>  checks for whether it is successfully resolved, no components means there is 
>  no cost for failure, and it is a ROUTINE spell making it really quite trivial
>  to learn someone's name whether they like it or not.
>
>  Can we add a resolve task check to this spell? I am thinking something bizarrely
>  reverse-logic... the smaller they are the less likely you will be able to determine
>  their true name?  Myths and legends are... mythical and legendary... meaning their
>  names should be pretty easy to divine. Also check against the ABJURATION skill...
>  players with high levels of abjuration understand how to protect themselves from 
>  magic so would be more difficult to divine.
>
>  Also consider changing from a ROUTINE spell to a HARD?
>

Skiamorfi (Elemental Form)
==========================
Effect              : Turn into elemental form
Element             : Depends (Earth, Fire, Air, Water or Spirit)
Form                : Transmutation
Acquire Level       : Master / 60 guild stat
Area of effect      : Self
Spell Class Level   : Power 2 - Minor Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : None (Optional 10 from Racial guild)
Tax                 : 0.875%
Special Description : This turns the caster into elemental form. This gives a 
                      minor aid to the caster in that their inventory of 
                      items is hidden from view (thieves can still steal from 
                      them though). It also has a chance to give them a small 
                      evade ability and possibly a small magical resistance
                      ability. If they are a member of the optional Racial 
                      guild, it also gives them the ability to see invisible 
                      creatures as well as change the "form" they take. Taxing
                      extra 0.500% for the evade/resistance although they 
                      aren't guaranteed when it is cast that they will get 
                      them.

>   Providing any combat aid in the form of evade or resistance needs to be accounted
>   for. Doesn't really matter if the benefit is only occasional. The caster can cast
>   the spell as often as they like until they get the optimal outcome?
>
>   The evade code being used is non-standardised, so hard for me to work out the combat
>   aid being applied. Beta testers are implying its actually quite significant? By looks 
>   25% evade in the way the army of Angmar shield special used to work? That is not a small
>   evade. I'd rather this spell inherits the standardised evade spell and so we can set a  
>   combat aid for it that will change with global changes to the base spell.
>
>   And this isn't going to fly for a bonus to MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC:
>
>        magic_resist = 15+random(spell_caster->query_stat(SS_OCCUP)/10);
>
>   This offers open ended magic resistance bonus, and no combat aid associated to it. 
>
>   LIVE_I_SEE_DARK also provides combat aid. It isn't well detailed on how to account
>   for it, however the SoHM pay 20% caid for 'truesight' (+5 SEE_DARK / +10 SEE_INVIS),
>   and the Priests of Takhisis pay 20% caid for 'peyes' (+5 SEE_DARK / +5 SEE_INVIS).
>
>   Is it just +1 bonus for the racial component? 
>   For +1 SEE_DARK / SEE_INVIS i'd probably think there is a baseline 10% caid we'd need
>   to apply... so what you've allocated is fine. although i'm not sure what the value is 
>   of only +1 see invisibility? You may want to boost that, or maybe test whether you can
>    see anything with only +1 see_invis?
>
>   As it stands, this is looking like a maintained spell that provides 25%(?) evade combat aid,
>   30%-70%+ resistance aid (based on how I calculate magic resistance it as outlined above), and 
>   10% for the optional SEE_DARK /  SEE_INVIS.  So 55-95% to 65-105% combat aid unaccounted for.
>
>   That level of combat aid would also class it as a Power 3 spell, not Power 2.

Special Description : Un-equips target current weapon(s), small delay for 
                      them to re-equip it/them. This spell is air branch 
                      only.

>   It looks like the targets can't re-wield another weapon, pick anything

Dilitirio (Poison)
==================
Effect              : Poison health

Tax                 : 0.750%
Special Description : This spell is water branch only. 

>    Non-standard spell based off blind spell template. 
>    Dispel time 600... so a 10 minute health burn.
>    Interval 20, strength 100, health damage 450.
>    So 30 ticks of health damage totalling 13,500 health damage at 1350 health/minute.
>
>    A mega-myth with con of 266 has a health pool of 5220.
>    193 con has a health pool of 3760.
>    92 (veteran) con has a health pool of 1740.
>
>    This is essentially an insta-win playerkilling spell unless you can cure poisons.
>    Reminds me a lot of the old Morgul Mage morthul poison spell that was removed.
>    
>    This spell has the same issues outlined under the Anavo spell.
>
>    I am thinking that poison spells using /std/poison_effect.c are going to be very hard to 
>    balance properly, and I am going to have to be very conservative in the values we agree
>    to allowing. So for 45% combat aid, 450 damage with a 20-30 second internal would be 
>    comparable to the Blademaster battack special damage output. But the poison duration has to 
>    be much shorter. If we went 900 health / minute at a max of 2-3 minutes it may be ok.
>
>    So maybe Interval 15, max poison damage 225 (value dependent on spell power, meaning it
>    will scale depending on stats and skills), dispel time also dependent on spell power up to 180. 
>    That is a damage output of 2700 over 12 ticks / 3 minutes. Poison strength should be the 
>    average of the casters conjuration and water skill.
>
>    Also the spell difficulty should probably be HARD rather than ROUTINE.


Livra (Pound armour/body)
=========================
Effect              : Pound armour (hurt/break it) or body (if no armour worn)
Element             : Earth
Form                : Conjuration
Acquire Level       : Master / 60 guild stat
Area of effect      : One present target

CAID                : 60% (Occupational)
Tax                 : 0.750%
Special Description : This spell pounds (damages) the target's armour with 
                      a possibility it breaks (if it gets damaged enough). 
                      It also does damage to the target. This spell is 
                      earth branch only. 

>   set_spell_combat_aid(query_spell_combat_aid_modifier());
>   As with apeipso, set the max combat aid within the spell config and then do all modifications
>   through query_spell_combat_aid_modifier() function.
>
>   At_will spell instead of harm? This will be rotateable with Oxy?  Be mindful that maximum
>   combat aid for sustainable spells (i.e. at-will spells) is 60% combat aid. Combined with Oxy it
>   would be much higher? 
>
>   It only damages body armour? Doesn't seem like it is an instant break of the armour... more towards
>   the end of a fight so the combat aid of 10% for the breaking component is probably right. Will need
>   some feedback from playertesters on it.
>
>   The damage to magic armours should take into account any resistances the armour may have, in particular
>   if magical resistance to earth or magic. 

Tihosskias (Shadow Wall)
========================
Effect              : Block an exit with a shadow wall.
Element             : Life

Acquire Level       : Master / 60 guild stat

Spell Class Level   : Power 3 - Intermediate Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : 45% (Occupational)
Tax                 : 0.75%
Special Description : This spell summons a shadow wall that blocks a single 
                      exit. Undeads cannot move through this wall, anyone 
                      else can. It blocks the exit for a maximum of 54 
                      seconds. The actual time is calculated by the 
                      casters SS_SPELLCRAFT, SS_ELEMENT_LIFE and 
                      SS_FORM_CONJURATION skills 
                      (MIN(54, SS_SPELLCRAFT + SS_ELEMENT_FIRE + 
                      SS_FORM_CONJURATION)).
					  The caster cannot cast this spell for 30 seconds once
					  it is cast and they cannot cast it if an existing 
					  wall is still in place. This spell is spirit branch 
					  only.

>   Non-standard spell using the light spell template.
>
>   So.... this is a bit of a change from the SCoP shadow wall. Exit blocking got removed from
>   the game a while back. I am trying to dig up the post from a previous AoB saying that such
>   blocking was banned (I think it was Damaris). Anyway, can we change it to maybe leverage the
>   'slow' base spell?  Means players can pass through the wall eventually, but it is substantially
>   more difficult?
>
>   What is the combat aid for? Blocking/slowing spells don't normally have CAID attributed to it?


Tromazo (Alarm)

Paradido (Teleport to player)
=============================
Effect              : Teleports caster to known player
Element             : Air

Acquire Level       : Master / 70 guild stat
Area of effect      : One known target anywhere that caster is allowed
Spell Class Level   : Power 2 - Minor Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : None
Tax                 : 0.375%
Special Description : This spell can have a blacklist of rooms that players 
                      can't teleport to (namely guild halls, places they 
                      shouldn't be, etc...). Right now it uses the base
                      teleport spell which takes a lot of that into 
                      consideration already. This spell is air branch only.

>   This sort of teleport spell should be viewed as at least a Power 3 spell.
>
>   At this spell power level it is going to have to be a teleport to by request. So
>   the caster should have the target's permission to teleport to them.
>
>   Also wizards shouldn't be teleportable to.
>
>   This spell really opens up potential abuse... there are lots of places players
>   shouldn't be (like the shapechange room?), or areas that have been coded with 
>   entry pre-checks in earlier rooms (like Vingaard Keep, Minas Tirith, Minas Morgul
>   Rivendell etc) or even quests like climbing the stairs outside Minas Morgul. So it is 
>   important that there is a 'blacklist' of rooms or room directories outside of those  
>   that have got preset no teleport props set to them.
>
>   I didn't see any query of a blacklist in the code of the spell? We'll need to add such
>   a query, and have a conversation with the domain lieges around possible areas that
>   aren't appropriate for such a teleport.

Kinisi (Deliver Item)
=====================

Components          : None
CAID                : None
Tax                 : 0.375%
Special Description : This spell delivers a previously summoned water
                      globe to a known player of the caster. The water
                      globe is summoned by a command that only the water
                      cleric has (eglobe) and they can only have one of
                      them. They can insert small items into the globe up
                      to the maximum volume of the globe (currently set
                      at 25000 grams). This spell is water branch only.

>   Seems fine.
    
Diakopi (Break Gem)
=========================
Effect              : Breaks a gem into six shards that are used for spell 
                      components
Element             : Earth
Form                : Conjuration
Acquire Level       : Master / 70 guild stat
Area of effect      : Self - One gem in the caster's inventory
Spell Class Level   : Power 2 - Minor Spell
Components          : None
CAID                : None
Tax                 : 0.375%
Special Description : This spell will smash gems that are used by the 
                      Elementalist guilds as components into gem shards. 
                      This spell is earth branch only.

>   This isn't a power 2 spell, its a power 0 spell.  Largely a cosmetic 
>   creation of components.  I'd drop the tax to zero for it.

Special Description : This spell summons a fire wall that blocks a single 
                      exit. Players cannot move through this wall. It 
                      blocks the exit for a maximum of 36 seconds. The 
                      actual time is calculated by the casters SS_SPELLCRAFT,
                      SS_ELEMENT_LIFE and SS_FORM_CONJURATION skills
					  (MIN(54, SS_SPELLCRAFT + SS_ELEMENT_FIRE + 
					  SS_FORM_CONJURATION)).
					  The caster cannot cast this spell for 30 seconds once
					  it is cast and they cannot cast it if an existing wall 
					  is still in place. This spell is fire branch only. 

>   Same issue as with Shadow Wall. These sort of spells were banned a long time ago.
>   May want to re-work to leverage off the 'slow' spell/spell object?

>   So... how are we calculating the combat aid of a mass stun vs a targeted
>   stun against one opponent?  The way it looks is that up to a 150 combat aid 
>   stun is being applied to all enemies in the same way you'd apply to a single
>   target.  Clearly we can't apply an 150 caid stun to all opponents... I would 
>   think you need to ratio it. So if you assume 3 targets minimum up to 50 caid?
>   Happy to discuss... but 150 caid per target is too high.
