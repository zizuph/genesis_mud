                              ============
Magic within the worlds of Genesis is difficult to control.  Mastery over
the forms and elements takes years of training and dedication, and is 
rewarded only after complete devotion to the study.

Magical guilds may be either occuational or layman guilds.  However, it
is the occupational ones which can truly reap the rewards of a life spent
in the pursuit of magic.  Layman guilds are by definition for those who
only dabble in the arts, and therefore have no hope of reaching the power
of those in the occupational guilds.  As such, the rules for occupational
and layman guilds have some striking differences.

There are two types of magic users within Genesis, although both use the 
same spell system.  The two types are Mage and Cleric.  The differences
between the two are purely thematic, although in Genesis theme is all.

Distinctions of power
=====================
An important question is naturally how to order personal magic in
"cost". Which magic should be available to whom and so on. A very
natural rule-of-thumb is that players who are members in magic-related
guilds have access to magic that others never will see. You must also
distinguish carefully between which magic is available to which guild. 

For obvious reasons a fighter guild should only have very minor access
to healing magic. It's simply not their business to heal people, they
use offensive magic, but again not very powerful magic. A fighter guild
fights with weapons, not magic. A priest guild might have access to
powerful healing spells, but not very powerful offensive spells. A
wizard guild has offensive & defensive magic, but no healing magic and
so on. Use common sense when setting up the spellists and you will
have no trouble. Ignore common sense and rules, and you'll find
yourself outside the game as soon as it is discovered.


*** PRINCIPLE 4:  When developing a magic guild the distinction of class
***               needs to be clear. In general, Mage classes are strong
***               offensive with no healing abilities, while clerical
***               classes have access to healing magicks

Occupational Magic Guilds
-------------------------
The occupational magic guilds represent the "true" magic guilds.  They are
those places of study or worship for people who have completely (or mostly)
dedicated their life to magic.

Occupational magic guilds have a major bonus - they are not limited to the
same combat aid restrictions as every other guild.  It is understood that
in a fantasy setting, magic users are expected to occasionally (and briefly)
be much more powerful than a fighter type.

This does not mean occupational magic guilds should be death machines.  It
means that more freedom is given to them, in exchange for the drawbacks 
that they must suffer.

*** PRINCIPLE 1:  The additional combat aid benefit that magic guilds have
***               over other guilds needs to be balanced with appropriate
***               drawbacks.

The drawbacks for occupational magic guilds are the requirements of mana
usage, ingredients, and general vulnerability in melee combat.  Additional
drawbacks are hopefully incorporated into the theme of every occupational
magic guild, and would include things like slow advancement, enforced
roleplay, regulated (such as by quests/time) spell aquiring, no layman
guild options, etc.

*** PRINCIPLE 2:  At a minimum, occupational magic guilds drawbacks need to
***               take into consideration mana usage, component requirements
***               for their spells, and melee combat vulnerability.

It is not possible to list every benefit and drawback an occupational
magic guild could/should include.  Instead, it is hoped that the designer
of a magic guild will take the time to craft a fully fleshed-out guild
that includes both great benefits and great drawbacks to justify the
power of the guild.

Along with this freedom comes greater scrutiny.  Any occupational magic
guild should make every effort to explain the justification for each
spell in documentation, and be prepared to make adjustments as 
necessary for the benefit of the game.  Working closely with the office
of the Arch of Balance will go a long way towards making this work!


Layman Magic Guilds
-------------------
The layman magic guilds represent the dabblers of magic, or those who
have learned a few tricks.  They are places where a beneficial spell or
two may be taught to supplement the occupation of the members.

Layman magic guilds do not receive the same freedom from combat aid
restrictions that the occupational magic guilds receive.  They are still
bound by the 50% max combat aid, along with every other layman guild.
It is understood that combat aid cannot be exactly determined for every
situation, but an effort must be made in the documentation for the
guild.

The reason for this is that powerful magic (especially combat) is reserved
for those who have made sacrifices on an occupational level to achieve
that power.  Layman guilds are only to provide support to an occupation,
and therefore cannot give the training required to even come close to
the magical power of an occupational guild.

*** PRINCIPLE 3:   Powerful magic is reserved for occupational magic guilds.
***                Layman guilds are dabbler classes, and are to provide 
***                support to an occupation.


Spell Class Tax
---------------
Each spell beging with a base tax, which may then be modified due to
other factors.  The base taxes are:

Guild      Magical                Non-magical
           Layman   Occupational  Layman   Occupational
Class 1      0.25%      0.1%        1%         0.5%
Class 2      0.5%       0.25%       2%         1%
Class 3      1%         0.5%        N/A        N/A
Class 4      N/A        1%          N/A        N/A


Magic OCC Guilds - Max consistent 60 combat aid
Magic LAY Guilds - Max consistent 30 combat aid

Magic guilds may burst (i.e. do damage greater than consistent combat aid).
Burst combat aid MUST NOT be sustainable, otherwise it will effectively be
consistent combat aid.

    Combat aid maximums are set for each power level.
    
        Power 0: No actual effects
        Power 1: up to 10% max.
        Power 2: up to 20% max.
        Power 3: up to 100% max.
        Power 4: up to 250% max.
