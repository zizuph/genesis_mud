/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/doc/tax_doc
================================================================================
Update to reflect the current specials and caid attributed to them. The docs
in there are all dated following a lot of changes.

       -- FIXED

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/backstab.c
================================================================================
* When teamed you can backstab and eviscerate at the same time. Backstab has to
be included in the primary cooldown checks.

       -- FIXED

Typos:

* A few typos in the watcher messaging below:
"Hollandjr rises from the shadows behind the alert black-bearded militiaman, a blackened-
steel dagger in hand and plunges it  fatally into the alert black-bearded militiaman's
back!Hollandjr body freezes from the shock as blood starts pouring from the wound!"

       -- FIXED

- double space after 'plunges it  '
- need to use QTPNAME or QCTPNAME for any " 's " inclusions.


- spacing after 'back!'

       -- FIXED

- I think the wrong person freezes from the shock... shouldn't be the assassin!

       -- FIXED

"You twirl your blackened-steel dagger in a reverse grip, and silently sneak up 
behind the alert black-bearded militiaman, catching him unaware and plunge your 
blackened-steel dagger fatally into hisback!His body tenses up as you pull your 
blackened-steel dagger back out and blood starts pouring from the open wound!" 

- spacing needed before the his 'into hisback!His'

       -- FIXED

You twirl your blackened-steel daggerin a reverse grip, sneaking up behind the 
wary black-bearded sentryaiming for his back, but he turns around just in time, 
leaping backwards and revealing your intent!

- spacing needed between the dagger and 'in', and separating 'sentryaiming'

================================================================================
-

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/stun.c
================================================================================
It doesn't seem to initiate combat when prepping, even though 
set_ability_attack_during_prep is set. Combat needs to be initiated when 
used.

On further tests it doesn't initiate combat at all... that needs to be changed.
I think you may need to set_ability_offensive(1); in config_ability()

       -- FIXED
       
       

/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/obj/stun_obj.c has
set_stun_combat_aid set at 90... should be 80 according to tax_doc

       -- FIXED - Tax Doc updated, it should actually be 90 and not 80.

* All the weapon oils need to have long descriptions added in
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/weaponoils/   

      -- FIXED                                                            --



* Dragonbane should also include draconian as a race it works on  

       -- FIXED                                     --

       
       
* As with other specials, need to use QTPNAME or QCTPNAME for any " 's " inclusions. 

       -- FIXED

* Weird messaging when coating - grabbing a vial of tiny green vial??

"You grab a tiny vial of tiny green vial from your inventory and coat the 
blackened-steel dagger with the content."                                                                --

       -- FIXED   

       
       
       


* When you coat a weapon with oil, it messes up the condition messaging of it:

"Over a foot long, this blackened-steel dagger is carved into the shape of a
sinister looking dragon, hence it is often referred to as the dagger of
Draco. The pommel of the dagger is wrapped in serpent skin, and its edges
are extremely sharp. It seems quite a deadly weapon.
It looks like it is in prime condition.
This weapon is coated with a thin film of sizzling viridescent substance.
It looks like it is in prime condition."

When you add oil on top of oil, it doubles the issue:

2x oils:
"Over a foot long, this blackened-steel dagger is carved into the shape of a
sinister looking dragon, hence it is often referred to as the dagger of
Draco. The pommel of the dagger is wrapped in serpent skin, and its edges
are extremely sharp. It seems quite a deadly weapon.
It looks like it is in prime condition.
It looks like it is in prime condition.
This weapon is coated with a thin film of sizzling viridescent substance.

3x oils:
Over a foot long, this blackened-steel dagger is carved into the shape of a
sinister looking dragon, hence it is often referred to as the dagger of
Draco. The pommel of the dagger is wrapped in serpent skin, and its edges
are extremely sharp. It seems quite a deadly weapon.

Rather than changing the long description in the remove_shadow function,
mask the long(string str, object for_obj) function... have a look at 
/d/Krynn/guilds/sohm/spells/obj/enchant_weapon_sh.c for how you may do it without
getting these errors.                                                                                       --

       -- FIXED  



* Typo in combat message (swipess):
"Hollandjr swipess the legs of the prepared noble militiaman with his sizzling 
viridescent blackened-steel dagger, causing copious damage." 

       -- FIXED                                                  --

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/garotte.c
================================================================================
* It is a pretty cool special! But when you fail to successfully garotte someone
it isn't clear you have lost your garotte. May want to update the messaging to
make it clear the thin wire has broken or something.

       -- FIXED
       
       

* The wire is classed as a 'strong' wire... but only one use? Is it worth
considering increasing the component requirement to make, but increase its potential
use to 5 or 6 garrotes?

       -- FIXED, working as intended. I want the special to consume a wire
          for each use, or give it a random change (1/6) of breaking instead.
          
          

* set_effect_combat_aid(90) in ~obj/garotte_obj.c should be 80.

       -- FIXED. Should be 90 and not 80. Tax document updated.




================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/blind.c
================================================================================
* hook_special_complete() needs a '.' at the end of its reset message:
'You feel ready to execute blind or any other primary ability again'

       -- FIXED. 

/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/specials/obj/blind_obj.c has
set_effect_combat_aid set at 90... should be 80 according to tax_doc

       -- FIXED. Should be 90 and not 80. Tax document updated.

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/shadows/fire_combat_msg.c
================================================================================
* If you are masking all the hit messages, your messaging need to take into account
factors of whether they have blood for the messaging incorporating blood (stone 
golems and ghosts don't for example), whether they breathe (you use heavy 
breathing in some messaging) and whether they've got a head to decapitate or 
a neck to break (breaking the neck of a willowisp or an undead hand for example 
doesn't make sense). 

       -- FIXED



Have a look at the Blademaster special code for the check_for_head function
as an example and the decap_no_corpse function. If you are using decapitating 
messaging you should incorporate a similar system (and ideally an option to
turn it off as a kill message/function).

       -- FIXED



Also consider querying props like LIVE_I_UNDEAD, LIVE_I_NO_BODY, LIVE_I_NO_CORPSE
and query_humanoid to determine whether certain messaging is appropriate. The
detail is important. Have a look at the backstab.c base code as an example of
how to incorporate it.   

       -- COMMENT: I did revise this, and the messages are more or less
          neutral. Maybe I will consider adding more flavour later.
          
          

The messaging also doesn't take into account whether the person is tanking or playing
support... so you get strange messaging that implies they are being targeted even
though they aren't:
"As the vigilant blue-eyed militiaman takes a swing at Hollandjr, the blow is parried by
Hollandjr's blackened-steel dagger! Hollandjr swiftly steps aside and stabs the vigilant
blue-eyed militiaman in the body with the blade!"                                                               --

       -- FIXED
       
       


* For some reason the default kill message kicks in when the target is still
feeling very well:
You decapitate the the alert scarred militiaman with your blackened-steel dagger!
The alert scarred militiaman lightly bruises your body with his shiny spiked mace.
The alert scarred militiaman lightly bruises your body with his shiny spiked mace.
You decapitate the the alert scarred militiaman with your blackened-steel dagger!
You strike at the alert scarred militiaman's right arm with your left fist, but he dodges your attack.
You feel ready to perform another backstab.
You feel ready to execute eviscerate or any other primary ability again.
h all
You are physically feeling very well and mentally in full vigour.
The alert scarred militiaman is feeling very well.

       -- FIXED




Typos:
* Throughout there is the use of QCTNAME(this_player()) + "'s" when you should
be using QCTPNAME(this_player) or QTPNAME(this_player) to add the "'s"   

       -- FIXED


                            --

* Double 'the' for attacker message when decapitate message kicks in: 
"You decapitate the the dragonarmy guard with your blackened-steel dagger!"     

       -- FIXED


* Grammatically broken sentence for watcher: 
"Hollandjr decapitate Guard to with his blackened-steel dagger!"    

       -- FIXED (decapitate switched to lacerates)   

      

* Spacing typo between into and his:
"You lunge at the vigilant blue-eyed militiaman and thrust your blackened-steel 
dagger into  his arm."           

       -- FIXED                                                                     --

*wrong tense... 'his collapses' should be 'he collapses'.. should be 'onto the
ground' instead of 'into the ground'.
"The blackened-steel dagger sinks deeply into the alert black-bearded 
militiaman's back, is twisted and pulled back out, shredding flesh and bone on 
its way out. The wound left behind is so grievous that his collapses into the 
ground, dying instantly."   

       -- FIXED                                                                                --

* typo 'int' should be 'in'
"Hollandjr opens a shallow wound int the head of the alert noble militiaman with a 
wide blade of his eagle-shaped dagger."     

       -- FIXED                                                            --

* typo with inclusion of 'to' in watcher message. Also should be lacerates rather
than lacerate
"Hollandjr lacerate Calof to with his blackened-steel dagger!"  

       -- FIXED                                        --


================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/shadows/fireknives_sh_occ.c
================================================================================

* The way incognito has been set up in show_subloc in the guild 
shadow results in all armours and weapons being completely hidden from both
the player and observer. I am not in favour of this. Cosmetic hiding of titles
is fine, but not hiding of equipment through TEMP_SUBLOC_SHOW_ONLY_THINGS.
Please change.

       -- FIXED. Commented out show_subloc from shadow as it was unecessary.

* Have you tested whether expel_me() works? Normally when you make a player
do a command you need to prefix the command with a "$" (see man command).

       -- FIXED. Tested and verified this many times that the command works
          as intended.



================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/souls/fireknives_guild_soul.c
================================================================================

* do_ficreatecomp and create_oil functions:
The create oil/component functions doesn't have any checks for the alchemy skill. 
The more exotic oils (like dragon, elemental, undead) should require the maximum 
alchemy skill to create (40).                                                                     --

Should also add a chance to fail to create oils/components as well based on skill.                --


       -- FIXED.  Formula : if (random(43) > alchemyskill. If fail, component
          is ruined and no oil is created. Even with max skill, there is a chance
          for a botched attempt.


* do_fihang(string str)
Needs to be placeable in rooms with ground only. Need to check rooms for the
ROOM_IN_AIR, ROOM_IN_WATER, ROOM_UNDER_WATER props before allowing to place
the corpse pole. 

      -- FIXED.                                                                                 --

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/fireknives_pole.c
================================================================================

* I'd like this to either decay after a certain period of time or can be removed
by players. 

      -- FIXED. The pole is on display for 10 hours before it's removed. Players
                can't remove it for now. One might also contemplate limitation on
                how many of these that can be on display at any given time.

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/bleed_to_death_obj.c
================================================================================
* What is this paralysis for? I see it is created from the execute_obj.c but
I don't see any commentary around its purpose. I am guessing it is a guild
punishment thing?

      -- COMMENT: This item paralyzes the target when bleeding to death. It's 
         more a thematic / prolonged cutscene where somebody doesn't instantly
         die, but dies over a short period of time. THere is no way to avoid
         the death when this happens. This happens during 2 different scenarios,
         guikdkick, or guild punishment of member.



* As with previous comments, don't use (this_object())->query_name()+"'s" for
the possessive. Use QPNAME or query_art_possessive_name()    

      -- FIXED                                    --

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/execute_obj.c

* Add set_no_show() in the create object... using OBJ_I_INVIS prop doesn't always
work as intended.

      -- FIXED

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/expel_obj.c
================================================================================
* Add set_no_show() in the create object... using OBJ_I_INVIS prop doesn't always
work as intended.

      -- FIXED

* The expelme_fireknife function will probably need seteuid(getuid()); called 
before the bleed object is cloned and moved to the player for it to work
properly.

      -- FIXED

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/dummy.c
================================================================================

* I am guessing this dummy is a wizard test object, not something available
in the guild or to mortals. In its current state it shouldn't be publicly
available.

      -- COMMENT: Correct. This dummy is not a part of the guild, but rather a 
         guild testing object. It will not be cloned anywhere in the guild upon
         guild opening.

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/fire_wristsheaths.c
================================================================================

* In the do_wristhelp function it says you wear and remove the wristsheath from
your back. Pretty sure it is your wrist! ;)

      -- FIXED

* I'd suggest restricting whether you can draw weapons with the wristdraw
commands to only work if the sheaths are worn. 

      -- FIXED

* The wristsheaths don't seem to save... you drop them when you log out.

      -- FIXED

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/fireknives_weapon.c
================================================================================

* The hit and/or pen exceed the maximum allowable for non-magical knives. See
'man weapon'... hit/pen can't be higher than 20/20.. (just an fyi, there are
quite a few knives in Faerun that break this requirement, like the drow
knives).

      -- FIXED

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/quest_ulaks.c
================================================================================

* In set_long it says <insert more description here>. This needs to be included.

* These are weapons, but are created as an object. Did you want to include a
wield command that provides a reason why you can't wield them?

      -- FIXED
      
================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/obj/silver_oil.c

      -- REMOVED, not part of the active guild.

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/rooms/climb*
================================================================================

* The climb checks should incorporate SS_CLIMB in some way... possibly reducing
the fatigue costs.   

      -- FIXED, 50 in climbing reduces fatigue with 50%.                                                                               --

* Room description says you can 'read the plaque', but you can only examine it.
May want to add a cmd option to read the plaque too.

================================================================================
/d/Faerun/guilds/fire_knives/rooms/join.c
================================================================================

* The permission prop for joining is commented out, which is fine... although

* the shop keeper here has in his description <check merchandize>, but it
seems the correct syntax is <check display table>.

      -- FIXED

* the price when <check display table> for each item is 10 cc, but they all
sell for 100 cc. Which is a problem, as some are worth more than 100 cc which
opens up the possibility of buy/sell abuse (gloves and boots worth 288 cc).

      -- FIXED, items now sell for a considerable more price than it's possible
                to sell.

* Typo when buying items for the buy and watcher.. it always returns the
alchemy kit:

      -- FIXED, prices are not set in between 3000-8000 copper range,
         and the items are by default 1000 copper less valuable than 
         the black market price.

Also the watcher message is missing a space:
