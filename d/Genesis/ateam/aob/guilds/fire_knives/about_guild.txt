           INFORMATION FOR THE FIRE KNIVES IN FAERUN (Occupational)
*****************************************************************************

The Fire Knives are a brotherhood of assassins that operate from the lands 
of Faerun, under the approval of the founding council. The group is led 
by one known as 'The Elder', also referred to as the Grandfather of 
Assassins, who doesn't much rule but rather oversees the activities of the 
guild and nudges it in the right direction from time to time, acting via 
his or her trusted agents. 

While other 'chapters' of the outfit operates from Westgate under the 
castle Castle Cormaeril, other agents of the guild operate within all 
the major world cities and in the wilderness. One of their bases of 
operations is situated atop the Sword mountains of Faerun in an earlier 
abandoned keep, where trainees are brought in young and raised by the 
Brotherhood, and this is where the Genesis 'chapter' is currently 
located. 

They are particularly dangerous because of their ability to blend in with 
high society along with their eagerness to accept almost any job, at a 
price, if only to hone their skills.

They apply a variety of poisons and alchemical ingredients for their iconic
fiery knives. The Genesis chapter applies a whole array of various craftable
weapon oils that when applied to a knife, a certain chemical burn or effect
will hurt or damage a certain race (or subrace). Other ingredients such
as blinding powder and garotte wire are also items that must be 
crafted.

Their training also includes the Art of Assassination, which is an array of 
various specials or tools of the trade that will augument them in combat. 
Most of the abilities do not overlap, but they can mix and adjust their 
tactics on the go for versatility and potential tactical advantage on the go.

The guild is very strictly ruled with an iron fist. The Elder has all the 
say and power, with the Fist and the Inquisitor as guild  lieutenants. Every 
rank in the guild is promotional only, and specials related to the Art of 
Assassinations are unlocked and strictly controlle by this feature.

The guild sport apprentice ranks, in which the brotherhood test and hone new 
candidates for the life as a full member assassin, ready to carry out 
whatever orders the Elders demand. Rank growth is expected to be a demanding 
but meaningful progression with the possibility of failure. In short, a 
proper method of selection.

Contracting is a central theme of the guild. Anyone may approach the guild 
and make a deal about contract payment for a certain individual. When a 
contract is set, the contract system will handle the logistics and the 
coins, in which members of the outfit can 'complete' with the permission of 
the elders. Players can only contract online players, and pay the 
minimum (hardcoded) price + any additional fees agreed upon. Minimal fee 
is based on the avg of the target, and caps at 10k platinum + fees. Players 
with under 100 avg can't be contracted. Assassins releasing a contract will 
get the coins, plus his or her 'assassin gauge' increases, which unlocks 
new titles. This is integrated PvP ranking which noone controls and is 
only visible on the internal memberlist.

Herbing is a necessary part of the guild since many ingredients and weapon 
oils require them, along with alchemy sets. Wires for garotte and powder 
for blinding must also be crafted from raw materials.

Activity (meter) will be measured by Elders being forced to leave the guild 
hall and actively track down and kill npc targets that may be placed at 
certain areas (random) anywhere in the game. Elders that fail being 
sufficiently being active will be demoted to regular member status.

Players who wish to join the guild must conduct 'the climb', a relatively 
and potential lethal journey, for then to submit an application on a board 
only readable by the Elders and the full members.

The guild is inherently evil. In practical sense, it means that if alignment 
surpasses neutral, special penalties will apply, playing on the consciouness 
of the character since the deeds are unfair, brutal and dishonest.
