============================================================================
                        Magic System Proposal
============================================================================

I.      Spell Power

    The "Power" ranges from 0 (cantrips) to 4 (advanced). Spell power is 
    the primary factor for how much tax a spell will cost.

    Power 0 [Cantrips]
    ==================
    Generally spells that only have cosmetic effects within the game.  
    *Very* limited informational spells might be placed in this category as
    well.

> Cosmetic effects, meaning a glorified emote? Or are we talking things
> like changing the description of an item or person? Maybe give an
> example of what such a spell might be.
    
    Power 1 [Very Minor Spells]
    ===========================
    Typically spells that harms no one, only gives limited information
    and help. Examples of this kind of magic is temporary light and limited 
    information detection spells.

> Should we be more prescriptive here? Perhaps something like "Information
> spells of this class cannot reveal more than 25% success of
> MAGIC_AM_ID_INFO" would be useful? Or, are these just meant to be
> broad definitions and we get more specific info somewhere further
> down? I guess I'll find out. :-)
    
    Power 2 [Minor Spells]
    ======================
    Very minor healing/damage, easy detection spells, minor defensive,
    dispelling spells.

> Again, do we need to spell out ranges for power? 
    
    Power 3 [Intermediate Spells]
    =============================
    Ordinary healing/damage, detection, defense, dispelling etc.

> "Ordinary" doesn't mean anything to my mind. Perhaps "mid-range" ?
    
    Power 4 [Advanced Spells]
    =========================
    Advanced detection spells (see stuff in other rooms, know other
    people's inventories etc). Powerful attack/healing spells. Advanced
    dispelling, maybe even stat-affecting spells. Limited conjuring power
    for very advanced players.

II.     Spell Type

    Spell Type is a categorization for spells based on how it will be used.

> How it will be used, or how often it can be used?

    At Will Spells
    ==============
    These are abilities that can be used constantly without running out
    of mana in normal circumstances. They will result in effects similar
    to what a fighter's combat special is and will allow a caster to
    grind. Obviously, these spells will be less powerful than melee fighter
    specials (~60% combat aid max)

> Very specific and clearly spelled-out. Nice!

    Standard Spells
    ===============
    These are most like the spells that exist in the game today. Used
    enough, they will drain the caster completely, but they can use it
    fairly regularly. These type of spells allow the caster to have
    the type of "burst" activity that defines one of their main
    advantages over melee fighters.

> If this document is meant to serve as a guide for future generations,
> then the first sentence will not stand the test of time. What would
> be a way to say this in a manner that will?

    Encounter Spells
    ================
    These are spells that have a cooldown equivalent to the caster's regen
    cycle. They are not meant to be cast very often, and usually at most
    once within an encounter. These types of spells will typically drain 
    1/3 to 1/2 of their mana. An example for this might be teleportation
    or some stronger duration spells.  
    
    Daily Spells
    ============
    These are truly awesome spells which tend have extremely long cooldowns.
    They require tremendous preparation and would need to cost almost
    all of a caster's mana. Examples of this would be stat cloud, or
    even resurrection.
        
III.    Components

    Components make for an essential part of the spell casting experience.
    It differentiates the spellcaster from the melee fighter, who does
    not need to prepare to be effective. Components can be either
    verbal, somatic, or material. Their use or non-use will affect both
    casting time as well as tax.

> Give examples of the three categories? If I don't know what somatic
> means, I'm sure there will be others just as ignorant. ;-)

    The practical use of components is to advance theme, while also
    forcing upon casters a "time cost" to the spells to help justify
    the greater power for the spell. The time cost should be adjusted
    accordingly so that the overall xp gain possible using spells
    should roughly equal a melee character who doesn't have spells nor
    component needs.

IV.     Casting Time and Cooldown

    Casting Times are dependent on the type of spell being cast as well
    as the components that the spell involves. Thematically, the reason
    for this is that it takes much longer to unlock the power of a spell
    if you don't have aids like components to focus the unlocking effort.
    
    Spells such as Encounter and Daily have cooldowns because they are
    so powerful they are not meant to be cast very often.
    
                Standard Casting/Cooldown Times
                -------------------------------
                Casting Time    Cooldown Time   Total Time
    At Will         4 sec          11 sec        15 sec
    Normal         10 sec           0 sec        10 sec
    Encounter      20 sec           5 min      5 min 20 sec
    Daily          30 sec           1 day      1 day 30 sec   
    Group Ritual    1 min (min)     0 sec         1 min
    
    For all spells, the minimum cast time will be 4 seconds. Using
    various adjustments, one can reduce the cast times. Group Rituals
    always have a minimum of 1 minute.
    
    Verbal Spell.................... minus  2 seconds
    Somatic Spell................... minus  2 seconds
    Component cost <  1 gp.......... minus  2 seconds
    Component cost >= 1 gp.......... minus  4 seconds
    Component cost >= 1 pp.......... minus 10 seconds
    Component cost >= 12 pp......... minus 15 seconds    
    Component cost >= 144 pp........ minus 20 seconds    
  
> gp? pp? I think we need help knowing that those mean.

    Note: You can use a maximum of two material components to reduce
          the casting time.
    
> Is this model saying that components are optional, but reduce the
> casting time if used by the player? Or are we instead saying that
> the coder may require components to reduce the casting time of the
> spell once and for all?

V.      Casting Success

    Spell casting success is determined by the query_casting_success()
    method inside of /d/Genesis/specials/spell.c. It uses resolve_task 
    along with a difficulty setting. A positive number from the function 
    means that the cast was a success. The actual contributors to the
    resolve_task are as follows:
    
        35% Element Skill
        35% Form Skill
        10% Intelligence
        10% Wisdom
        10% Discipline
    
    Because it uses resolve_task, casting is never a guaranteed success.

    Difficulty Level that the spell is set to must adhere to the
    following difficulties depending on its power level:
    
        Power 0: Difficulty (Automatic)
        Power 1: Difficulty (Easy)
        Power 2: Difficulty (Routine)
        Power 3: Difficulty (Hard)
        Power 4: Difficulty (Difficult)

VI.     Tax Calculations

    Tax for magic spells is calculated in a different manner than melee
    specials. Because a caster often has many spells in his or her
    arsenal, it's not possible to charge melee combat aid tax for
    each individual spell. It would quickly exceed the maximum for any
    guild. Instead, spells are charged a tax depending on a few factors,
    including spell power, components used, and whether it's used in
    a layman or occupational guild.
    
    Chart for Base Tax Costs
    ------------------------
                Magical                Non-magical
                Layman   Occupational  Layman   Occupational

    Power 1      0.25%      0.1%        1%         0.5%
    Power 2      0.5%       0.25%       2%         1%
    Power 3      1%         0.5%        N/A        N/A
    Power 4      N/A        1%          N/A        N/A  
    
> So Power 0 spells are untaxed? I guess that must mean they are literally
> nothing more than showy fluff for flavor?

> Interesting. This means that the same spell would cost more in a 
> layman guild compared to an occ?

    There are also a few rules for taxing skills.
    
    Rule 1: Maximum Effect
            Spells of various degrees are taxed only once - at maximum
            effect. For example, if you have a small fire attack spell,
            and a big fireball, only the fireball will get taxed.

> I assume, therefore, that you cannot then cast the big and small
> version in such a way that you cancel out the cooldown times and
> increase aid beyond tax?

    Rule 2: Differing Varieties/Flexibility
            Taxed is based on benefit to the guild as well as the 
            variety and flexibility one has in effects. Two differing
            effects will be taxed separately, even if they do the same
            thing. For example, a lightning bolt and fireball, even if
            they deal the same damage, will be taxed separately.

> If so, then perhaps the converse of the above question is true here?
> You could cast a lightning bolt, and then while the cooldown is in
> effect for that, you could cast the fireball.

    Rule 3: Combat aid will affect tax in that the guild is charged
            1% of tax for every 25% of total combat aid for all spells,
            up to a maximum of 250% combat aid (10% tax)

    Components (or lack of them) will alter the base tax cost. Each
    spell should have a material, somatic, and a verbal component. If
    missing any of these, it decreases the counters to spell casters,
    therefore it should be charged extra tax. Power 0 spells are not
    required to have any components, but they should be used if thematic.
    The changes in cost will be determined by the following table.
    
        Missing 1: 150% normal cost.
        Missing 2: 200% normal cost.
        Missing 3: 250% normal cost.

> Perhaps be more explicit here. Does this mean you can satisfy the
> 3 component requirement with 3 different materials? Or, does this
> mean you need three separate types of components?
                 
    Standard material components are valueless, other than for
    spellcasting, and are available from the guild for a "small" fee.
    These components disappear when the player leaves the game.  More
    complex procedures to obtain components and more expensive components
    may reduce the cost of a spell.  To gain a bonus, components must always
    be consumed.

        Quest required to get component : -25%*quest level
        Component guarded by creature   : -avg_stat_of_creature
        Component cost is < 1 gp        : 0%
        Component cost is >=1 gp        : -25%
        Component cost is >=1 pp        : -50%
        Component cost is >=12 pp       : -75%
        Component cost is >=144 pp      : -90%

> Still don't know what pp and gp mean. Also, I am not sure I understand
> this whole concept. What is being accomplished with the chart above?
> Does this mean using components that are more difficult to acquire,
> you lower the tax of the spell by the % listed? Perhaps outline
> how to read the chart.

    Other special circumstances may be devised which could result in bonuses
    (or penalties!) to your tax rate.  The exact details will have to be
    decided by an archwizard as they are needed. 

VII.    Mana Calculations

    Standard Mana Regeneration
    --------------------------
    Mana regeneration will become significantly faster, while at the same 
    time reducing the overall pool of mana that players have. This change 
    should provide the backdrop for the magic system changes proposed in 
    this document. 
               
> Again, this paragraph will not stand the test of time. Is it just
> a temporary clause that will be omitted when final draft is achieved?

    Mana Regen Formula:
    (1 + ((wis) * (100 - (pintox) / 2) * ((sc) > 30 ? (sc) : 30)) / 50000)     
    
    Total Mana Formula:
    (int * 10) / 3
    
    The chart below will give the mana expectations for someone who has
    100 spellcasting skill (sc) and is not intoxicated.
   
             Total Mana      Regen/Minute        Time to Full     
    Avg Stat     
    100          333               63                5.28 min
    150          500               99                5.05 min
    200          666              126                5.28 min
    
    * Minor differences in time are due to integer calculations

    At Will:    Casters should get 4 at-will spells cast (15 second
                specials) every minute. The mana cost will determine
                the power of the special, and it will be set at a
                percentage based on max regen rate. So for example,
                the stat 100 person would cost 15 mana per cast, and
                the 150 average person would get charged 24 mana.

> Perhaps "should get" in the first sentence should read "should
> get a maximum of"? I would further make this paragraph easier to
> understand by adding: "So, for example, the stat 100 person would
> cost 15 mana per cast, and have a spell power of 15, while a
> 150 average person would get charged 24 mana, but have a spell power
> of 24."

    Standard:   Standard spells should deplete a caster's mana
                if used continuously. They will have a fixed cost, 
                rather than the dynamic one that At Will powers have.
                Each standard spell will come with a base mana
                cost of 30 mana. At 4 second casts, a stat 100 person
                would thus deplete there mana in 40 seconds, using
                up 10 standard spells.
    
    Encounter:  In general, encounter spells should be very awesome.
                They should only be cast once or twice in a regen
                cycle, with the regen cycle time essentially 
                being the cooldown for the cast. The base cost for
                an encounter spell will be 200 mana. At this cost,
                someone at 100 stat should be able to cast it once,
                someone at 150 stat can cast it twice, and someone
                at 200 stat can cast it three times.

> Do we need to reitorate that Encounter spells should be awesome
> here? It seems unecessary and redundant given that this is a
> section devoted to casting times, and we have already discussed
> the nature of the class above.
    
    Daily:      These types of spells should take about 300 mana and come
                with a real daily cooldown. No more than one can be cast
                in any 24 hour period. Also, there is a minimum of a
                6 hour cooldown.

> Perhaps explain this more? A reader might not understand what a
> "real daily cooldown" means. Perhaps: "A real daily cooldown means
> that once the spell is cast, it cannot be cast again on the same
> RL date. To avoid players waiting until right before midnight to
> achieve a quick double-cast, a minimum 6 hour cooldown is also
> required."

VIII.   Spell Strength

    The power rating of a spell determines the range of effects that it
    can have. Each caster will exhibit different spectrum of the range
    in the spells that they cast. Less skilled and smaller casters will
    naturally fall at the lower end of that range, while more skilled
    and bigger casters will fall at the upper end of the range.
    
    All spell effects which can have a range must base the range on
    three factors: skills, stats, and a form of guild strength. Guild
    strength is a guild-specific factor that can be based on any
    number of things, such as guild stat, activity, tenure in guild,
    position within the guild, etc.
    
> "can have a range must base the range" reads oddly in the first
> sentence. 

    At Will spells will be special in that their strength will
    factor in the amount of mana that the caster uses, rather than
    skills and stats.

> So do we here have an example of a myth joining a spellcasting guild
> and instantly having more power with At Will spells than the
> rising hero who has actively participated in the guild for 5 years?
> The reason I ask is that this has been discussed as the reason that
> guildstat is factored into combat specials in a sandardized fashion.
> If At Will spells are meant to be the "combat specials" of the caster
> world, do we want to have similar goals for them in this way?
    
IX.     Duration Spells

    Duration spells will represent a constant drain on a caster's mana,
    rather than a one-time cost. If a caster runs out of mana, then all
    maintained spell effects end immediately. Duration spells will pay
    the cost depending on the usage type. Each spell will then have a
    cost of 5 mana points per minute. This means that a caster at 100
    stat can maintain at 10 duration spells without losing mana.
  
> How do we deal with items in the game that feed mana to the player
> at the same rate as the drain?

X.      Guild Spell Composition

    Still to be completed.
    - Mage vs Cleric
    - No limit on types of spells except that it has to be thematic.
      The 1/3 limit on attack and defence was just another rule people
      would try to work through at the expense of theme.
    - total combat aid for entire guild at any time capped at 250%
      for both defence and offence.
    - Aid granted to others count towards the maximum that can be
      in effect. Concurrent aid is something to think about.

XI.     Exceptions

    Exceptions to the above rules are made on a case by case basis.
    Obviously, the limit of spell types and effects we can have is
    only limited by the imagination of the wizard. Decisions are
    made on the basis of theme and playability.
    
    One thing that from the outset will be considered an exception
    will be tells. They are very cheap spells that are used very often.
    Based on the classification given in this document, they are a
    Power 1, Standard Spell. Despite their standard spell designation,
    the cost to mana for these spells will be minimal, allowing them
    to be cast more often in communication with others.
        
> Perhaps distinguish that by this we mean tells between a caster
> and a single target, as all-tell type spells are probably not
> an exception, right?
