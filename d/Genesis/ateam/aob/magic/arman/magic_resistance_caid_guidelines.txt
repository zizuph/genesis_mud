Determining combat aid for guild resistance specials
====================================================

Spells that provide resistance protection are quite common, specials less
so. Regardless, any guild ability that offers resistance protection will 
have a combat aid cost applied to their guild's total combat aid cap 
equating to 1% of combat aid per point of resistance offered.

Only one magical damage type can be applied from a magical attack, so the 
benefit of multiple resistance types technically do not stack when 
determining the aid of specials or spells that provide multiple resistances.

However this is not a balanced way of looking at resistances, and runs the
risk of spells and specials providing blanket immunity across all forms
at the same combat aid cost as targeted/tailored resistance options that 
make players actually think about the damage types they are likely to face.

So the following guidelines should be followed when incorporating resistance
abilities to a guild and determining the combat aid benefit to be applied 
towards the guild's combat aid cap:

* For a guild special that isn't a spell, each point of form resistance costs 
  1% combat aid.

* Resistance spells must use the /d/Genesis/specials/std/spells/resistance.c
  base spell as the spell template.

* Up to three MAGIC_I_RES_* form resistances may be included in such a 
  resistance spell for a combat aid cost of 1% per resistance point of the
  highest MAGIC_I_RES_* form resistance offered by the spell.

  So a resistance spell offering MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE of 15, MAGIC_I_RES_COLD of
  14, and MAGIC_I_RES_POISON of 13 would have a combat aid benefit of 15%.

* If the spell offers more than three MAGIC_I_RES_* resistances, an additional
  combat aid multiple of x1.1 (i.e 10% extra) is applied for each of the 
  additional spell form resistances over the original three.

  So a resistance spell offering MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE, MAGIC_I_RES_COLD,
  MAGIC_I_RES_POISON, MAGIC_I_RES_AIR, and MAGIC_I_RES_EARTH of 15 would have a 
  combat aid benefit of 15% multipled by a factor of x1.2 (two additional
  resistances over the base three), providing a combat aid benefit of 18%.

* If the spell offers less than three MAGIC_I_RES_* form resistances, that
  spell's combat aid is calculated at a multiple reduction of 1.1 (10%) per 
  resistance less than the base three.

  So a resistance spell offering only MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE at 15 will have an
  effective combat aid benefit reduced by 20% (2 less resistances than the 
  base three) for a combat aid of 12%, while a resistance spell that offers
  both MAGIC_I_RES_FIRE and MAGIC_I_RES_AIR at 15 will have an effective
  combat aid reduced by 10% (1 less resistance than the base three) for 
  a combat aid of 13.5%.

* As MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC resistance provides resistance against all the forms
  of which there are 14 (12 if you exclude *_MAGIC and *_IDENTIFY), this
  resistance type is treated differently from individual forms when 
  determining combat aid benefit. Every point of MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC is counted
  as 2% combat aid. This aid is cumulative with other form resistances 
  offered.

  So a resistance spell offering MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC at 15 would have a combat
  aid benefit of 30%.  A spell offering MAGIC_I_RES_MAGIC at 15 and 
  MAGIC_I_RES_AIR at 15 would have a combat aid benefit of 42% (30% for the
  *_RES_MAGIC component and 12% for the *_RES_AIR component).

* Resistance spells shouldn't mix meta and physical resistances (i.e. 
  physical being acid/cold/fire and meta being life/death etc), however this
  guideline can be bent for appropriate thematic reasons. Any such spells
  need to be approved by both the domain Liege and AoB.
