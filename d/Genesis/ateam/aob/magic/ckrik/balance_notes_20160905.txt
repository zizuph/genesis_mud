Rough notes from Skype with Petros on Guild Blance - 9/5/2016

Fighter OCC Guilds - Max consistent 100 combat aid
Figher LAY Guilds - Max consistent 50 combat aid???

********************************************************************************

Magic OCC Guilds - Max consistent 60 combat aid
Magic LAY Guilds - Max consistent 30 combat aid???

Magic guilds may burst (i.e. do damage greater than consistent combat aid).
Burst combat aid MUST NOT be sustainable, otherwise it will effectively be
consistent combat aid.

For example Morgul Mages have 1 60 combat aid damage spell that
consumes mana at the rate of the caster's mana regeneration. It is roughly
equivalent to Mercenaries' mattack. However, Morgul Mages can burst up to
250 combat aid limited by the number of potions (i.e. prepared charges)
and amount of mana they have available. Additionally, uber-spells like
stat-cloud are only usable once every 3 hours or so.

One note: The spirit of the rule governing burst combat aid is that the
player benefiting from the burst must spend in-game time to prepare.
The Nazguls are currently tasking their apprentices with preparing the
potions thereby breaking the spirit of the rule. This is something Petros
thinks we should examine again.

Example frameworks Petros suggested are:

Wizards spending time memorizing spells up to some maximum number of
slots limited by stats (e.g. like WoHS in Dragon Lance books).

Minstrels must play a gig at an in-game tavern/pub to earn a charge.

Framework to determine combat aid of specials and effects:

(Need second conversation with Petros)

Effect stacking might need to be examined again.

Ckrik was wondering how defensive and offensive combat aid should be
combined to arrive at an aggregate combat aid number for Monks. For example
if plexus grants 40 combat aid and strike grants another 40 combat aid
Petros thought it should 40 + 40 = 80 combat aid. Ckrik thought because one
is offensive and one is defensive it should be
(1.4 * 1.4 - 1.0) * 100 = 96 combat aid. Petros thought Ckrik may have a
point and needed to think about it. Stacking magical effects would be
accounted for in a similar way.

********************************************************************************

Non-combat aid spells are examined on a case-by-case basis and relies
heavily on precedent. They are also taxed based on precedent.

********************************************************************************

There is still a list of standard spell templates that need to be
implemented. An out of date list is in:

/d/Genesis/ateam/aob/magic/petros/magic_proposal.txt

Ckrik will compile an updated list.
