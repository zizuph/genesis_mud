
Compensation for component collection time
==========================================

In practice, mage guilds can take 20-30% of their time collecting herbs for their spellcasting.
In order to account for this lost combat time, we provide bonus CAID to various spells
depending on their relative work for herbing.

There are three tiers set up, and are applied spell by spell, based on the time needed to
collect herbs or other components.  The combat aid is a multiplier applied post white-hit
boost.  These are based on a core assumption of about 15 seconds per herb collection time,
which active spellcasters should be able to do consistently.

Maintained spells (those that last 15, 30 minutes etc) typically do not receive the 
modifier, as the herbing time is minimal compared to the effect time.

set_spell_component_factor(COMPONENT_AID_LOW);  1.1x multiplier

This is intended for spells that have a potion that lasts many casts.  A rough guideline
is 3 minutes of spellcasting for one herb can merit this bonus.

set_spell_component_factor(COMPONENT_AID_MEDIUM);  1.2x multiplier

This is intended for cases that may fall between the other two, perhaps only a half dozen
charges per potion, for example.

set_spell_component_factor(COMPONENT_AID_HIGH);  1.3x multiplier

This is intended for damage spells that have a one herb per cast cost.  Due to the
large boost, and potential PVP advantage, this doesn't compensate the caster in full,
based on a 15 second collection time.
