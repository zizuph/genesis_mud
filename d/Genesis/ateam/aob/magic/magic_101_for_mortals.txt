Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 1 (Introduction)

The anthropology of magic in Genesis is shrouded in mystery. What we
can confirm is that the toroid of Genesis is a world created through 
the force of magic - a single realm paradoxically of many, due to the
nature of magic being able to manipulate the very fabric of creation 
and the laws of nature itself. 

Under the Doctrine of Lars, Magic is considered one of the three most
powerful forces in Genesis - more influential than Death, and second
only to the power of Narrative.

While many view a force of such extraordinary magnitude as too potent 
a power to be wielded by mere mortal hands, it is mortals to whom magic 
is ultimately bound and accessed through two primary ways. 

The first type of access to magic is that which has been 'gifted' 
through ritual or prayer to occult beings of great divine, malevolent, or 
elemental power. Mortals accessing magic through these means are broadly
categorised in the class of 'clerics'. And while a broad generalisation,
their magical powers are highly dependent on their relationship with
their patron and their wisdom attribute.

The second type of access to magic is largely acquired through the
study of the arcane and tapping in to the innate magic that permeates 
the world of Genesis. Mortals who access magic in this way fall broadly
into the class referred to as 'magi', and whose magical powers are
largely dependent on their studies and their intelligence attribute.

While there may be distinction between clerics and magi in the process 
of casting spells or calling for divine intervention, there is
similitude in what influences the success or effectiveness of spells
and prayers. 

This is covered in some detail in 'Treatise on the workings of magic in 
Genesis - Volume 2 (Spellcasting)'.

===========================================================================
Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 2 (Spellcasting)

The performance of magic is commonly referred to as 'spellcasting' - 
irrespective of whether it is divine intervention in response to prayer or
the act of tapping in to the arcane through ritual. The specific outcome
sought through spellcasting is referred to as the 'spell'.

Simply having access to a spell doesn't mean one can cast it. All spells
fall in to one of six 'schools' of magic that allows for the creation
of the form of the spell. And all spells call upon one of six primal 
'elements' that power the spell. A certain level of mastery is required 
in both form and element skills before an aspiring spellcaster has any 
chance of casting such a spell successfully.

The six schools of magic that dictate spell form are:
* Abjuration - spells that protect, ward, and banish.
* Illusion - spells of tricks, falsehoods, and deception.
* Transmutation - spells that modify the world around them.
* Conjuration - spells that create and summon, and destructive magics.
* Enchantment - mind altering spells - charming, beguiling and dominating.
* Divination - spells seeing the future and the hidden.

The six elements that can power spell forms are Air, Water, Earth, Fire
Life and Death.

The act of casting a spell can be influenced by a number of factors. In
most cases spells involve the incantation of symbolic words - a verbal
component. In many cases the caster needs to be able to see the target of
their spell, or be stationary, or not be in combat.

If any of these factors are not met for a spell requiring these factors,
the spell cannot be cast. But there are also other more variable factors
that can influence the success of spellcasting. This is covered in some
detail in 'Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 3 
(Spell success)'.
===========================================================================
Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 3 (Spell success)

Magic is not easily tamed. The more challenging the attempt to manipulate 
the fabric of reality, the more likely the spellcaster will lose control
and the spell will fail.

The mental discipline attribute plays a key role in spell success.

If a brilliant and wise spellcaster is not disciplined enough they will 
struggle to control their own magical power, and will find it common
that their spells fail.

Mental discipline also plays a key role when defending against hostile 
spells. If a target has greater mental fortitude than the caster, the
caster will find it noticeably more challenging to successfully cast
offensive spells against them.

Two other factors plays a role in the successful casting of hostile 
spells - the target's knowledge of spellcraft and skill in abjuration.
 
Skill in spellcraft provides a fundamental understanding of how magic
works, and provides benefits in how to avoid it. Abjuration is the school 
of magic that focuses on protection, warding, banishing, and dispelling.
Knowledge of these skills provides benefits that work against the success 
of spells of a hostile nature. They are the dodge and parry skill of the 
magic world.

Attempting spellcasting while wearing a shield increases the chance of
spell failure. While holding a buckler may not result in a noticeable
increase in spell failure, the bigger tower shield will. And attempting
to cast spells with two shields is almost impossible.

Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 4 (Spell damage)

Of all the aspects of magic, spell damage is the most difficult to provide
generalisations on. Spells across sects, schools and guilds vary wildly 
in power. However if we look at a specific spell in isolation - in this
case a spell of harming - we can identify factors that influence damage.

Spellcasters have a natural spell power, that provides the base strength 
of a spell's damage or heal. This natural spell power is based off the
caster's spell elemental skill and the caster's primary spellcasting 
attribute. 

As a broad generalisation the mental attribute is typically wisdom for 
clerics and intelligence for magi, but in some cases it can be other 
attributes. The Minstrels of Terel are an example where the spellcasting 
attributes influencing the power of their songs is their dexterity and 
their discipline. 

In most cases spellcasters will not want to rely on their natural spell
power, but leverage the spell power of magical items such as magical 
staves, grimoires, wands, orbs, rings of power, or holy relics. These
items can provide the caster enhanced spell power and a more powerful
base damage for their harm spell. Note, only the single most powerful
item held, worn, or wielded will provide enhanced spell power.
Enhancement does not stack with either natural spell power or other
items of power, as the caster is channelling their spell through the
most powerful of their magical objects for greatest effect.

Those skilled in spellcraft can determine whether an object provides
an enhancement in spell power through appraising the object.

The damage of a spell can be impacted by a target's magic resistances 
or vulnerabilities. So know your enemies! Casting a fireball at a fire
elemental will do little more than annoy it, but will scare away a
tribe of forest trolls!

===========================================================================
Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 5 (Mana)

The casting and maintaining of spells is fatiguing, drawing from a mental 
pool referred to as 'mana'.

All spells have a casting cost to mana. Spells that are maintained have an
ongoing mana cost as well, that will end if the mana pool runs dry. 

The size of a caster's mana pool is determined by their intelligence
attribute. How quickly a caster's mana pool replenishes depends on their
wisdom attribute and spellcraft skill... and intoxication. Being drunk is 
very detrimental to caster recovery!

===========================================================================
Treatise on the workings of magic in Genesis - Volume 6 (Addendum)

In compiling this treatise on magic, please be aware that by its nature
magic will bend our understanding and break our conceived rules in
a fashion that would have some personify it as fickle and capricious.

An example would be a type of harm spell that breaks almost all the 
preceding 'rules' of magic - known as the 'quick harm' or 'at-will' 
spell.

These spells obey their own rules of mana regeneration, their own rules
in relation to spell damage, care not for natural or enhanced spell power 
of the caster, and are less effective against element-vulnerable targets.

Ah! Such is magic!
