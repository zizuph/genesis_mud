Petros,

I've not yet read Navarre's review of your work, so forgive me if what I
am about to say is redundant with anything he has already mentioned.

First off - great job! This looks like some exciting stuff to get into the
game. I am particularly excited to see the effects of these wounds that cause
damage over time.

I have only one observation for something that might want a second look. I
am a bit confused as to why the dragon attacks (breath, swoop, dragonfear)
are based at all on the stats of the player (strength, dex, intelligence.)
Are we assuming that a dragon is only as powerful as its master? My thought
here is that it might be more realistic to assume that dragons are always
powerful independant of the player. I'm no Krynn expert, of course, but
this was the one thing that gave me pause.

[Petros] The reason for using the stats of the player is that if we
         used the stats of the dragon, it would make the combat aid
         really wacky. This way, the growth in combat aid is
         measurable. It would be strange, for example, to have a
         veteran General who had an ancient dragon and could kill
         a champion with really crazy breath attacks.

That being said ... woo-hoo! Thanks for all the hard work, as always!
G.
