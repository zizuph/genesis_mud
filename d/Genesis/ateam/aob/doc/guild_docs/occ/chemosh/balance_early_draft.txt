Hi Petros,

I thought I'd turn in something of a rough draft balance document a ways
before it is time to officially submit the guild for review. I want to get
the main concepts nailed down correctly before getting too much farther down
the road, so I wanted to check with you on these things now rather than
later. Most of what is described below is actual in the code, with the
exception of all special attacks, defensive specials, tactics, and summoning
costs. What has been set up are all the stats, skills, race types, hit/pen
and AC values.

I'd like to know if you think there are any major red flags that I need to
address in my design for the sake of balance.

Thanks so much!
G.

                              Balance Document
                            The Cult of Chemosh
                    Occupational + Layman Necromancer Guild

                     Submitted by Gorboth, November 2012

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic concepts:

  - At max guild level, a Necromancer earns 21 research points to spend.
  - The points may be spent in five separate research areas.
  - Each research area has 10 tiers, each increasing power in that area.
  - A Necromancer may specialize in one research area.
  - Without specialization, maximum research in a given area is tier 5.
  - The 5th tier in any area is intended to provide "standard" power.
  - The 10th tier in any area is intended to be a game-changer.
  - To reach the 10th tier in any area, harsh sacrifices must occur elsewhere,
    denying the ability to reach "standard" power in some or all other areas.

This results in countless build options, anticipated to fall most frequently
into a number of regular categories. For balance purposes, it is probably most
important to consider these main four:
      (naturally, players will experiment and find many other build setups)

  - Severe Specialist    : 10, 5, 5, 1, 0 (full spec'd power, harsh drawbacks)
  - Balanced Specialist  : 10, 5, 3, 3, 0 (full spec'd power, even drawbacks)
  - Specalized Generalist:  8, 5, 5, 3, 0 (good spec'd power, fewer drawbacks)
  - True Generalist      :  5, 5, 5, 5, 1 (basic capabilities, no drawbacks)

Research Areas, and their tiers:

  Minion Offense (base is 20 in unarmed/weapon skills, 50% base str/dex)
      1.  40 in unarmed/weapon skills
      2.  60% base str and dex granted, hit/pen increased by 5
      3.  weak special attack granted, based on weapon/unarmed hit/pen, skill
      4.  60 in unarmed/weapon skills
      5.  75% base str and dex granted, hit/pen increased by 10
    -----[specialization cutoff]-----
      6.  medium special attack granted, based on weapon/unarmed hit/pen, skill
      7.  80 in unarmed/weapon skills
      8.  100% base str and dex granted, hit/pen increased by 15
      9.  100 in unarmed/weapon skills
     10.  high-powered special granted, based on same as above.

  Minion Defense (base defence skill is 20, 50% base con)
      1.  40 in defence and parry skills
      2.  base ac boosted by 10, 60% base con granted
      3.  60 in defence and parry skills
      4.  base ac boosted by 15, 75% base con granted
      5.  75 in defence and parry skills
    -----[specialization cutoff]-----
      6.  low-level stun special granted
      7.  90 in parry and defence skills, base ac boosted by 20
      8.  10% incoming hits deflected, 100% base con granted
      9.  100 in parry and defence skills
     10.  25% incoming hits deflected

  Minion Tactics (base tactic - minions will assist only if master *attacks*)
      1.  minions will now also assist if master *is* attacked
      2.  minions will now also assist if other minions are attacked
      3.  minions can be commanded to initiate combat with a target
      4.  minions able to carry things
      5.  master may move-behind minions -> Undead taunt

      6.  minions able to "burrow" to conceal themselves until recalled
      7.  minions able to "flush" target out a given exit
      8.  minions able to block exits
      9.  tanking minions will move behind healthiest minion if too hurt
     10.  minions able to wear/wield equipment

  Summoning Science (base minion count = 1, cost = 10 darksouls per minion)
      1.  2 minions may be summoned
      2.  minions cost 7 darksouls each
      3.  3 minions may be summoned
      4.  minions cost 5 darksouls each
      5.  4 minions may be summoned
    -----[specialization cutoff]-----
      6.  minions cost 3 darksouls each
      7.  5 minions may be summoned
      8.  minions cost only 2 darksouls each
      9.  6 minions may be summoned
     10.  minions cost only 1 darksoul each, 7 minions may be summoned

  Soul Science (natural soul/darksoul convserion = 7/1)
      1.  6/1 soul/darksoul conversion
      2.  10% of souls automatically convert to darksouls upon harvest
      3.  5/1 soul/darksoul conversion
      4.  20% of souls automatically convert to darksouls upon harvest
      5.  4/1 soul/darksoul conversion
    -----[specialization cutoff]-----
      6.  33% of souls automatically convert to darksouls upon harvest
      7.  3/1 soul/darksoul conversion
      8.  50% of souls automatically convert to darksouls upon harvest
      9.  2/1 soul/darksoul conversion
     10.  All souls automatically convert to darksouls upon harvest

To get a sense of the power players will be wielding, we should now list the
maximum numbers that minions might possess, both at standard and specialized
power. The highest-level minions can be raised with a 160 stat average. The
specific stats are all very much dependant on the following factors:

    - The Minion's base level and powers (determined by race, learned
                                          progressively by advancement
                                          through guild levels.)

                   public int    *Minion_Averages = ({
                      10, /* Wretch     */  (e.g. Frog, Mouse, Spider)

    - The Minion's class (based on the "thematic" ideas of a given race)

                  Minion Classes by Race:

                  Standard: (e.g. Human, Dog, Horse)
                    No alterations to base stats / powers

                  Savage: (e.g. Goblin, Boar, Lion) 
                    Armour Class:  50% of base
                    Hit/Pen     : 150% of base
                    Str         : 125% of base
                    Dex         :  75% of base
                    Con         :  75% of base
                    Mentals     :  75% of base

                  Nimble: (e.g. Hobbit, Deer, Mouse)
                    Armour Class:  75% of base
                    Hit/Pen     : 100% of base
                    Str:        :  75% of base
                    Dex         : 125% of base
                    Con         : 100% of base
                    Mentals     : 100% of base
    
                  Hardy: (e.g. Dwarf, Turtle, Mule)
                    Armour Class: 150% of base
                    Hit/Pen     :  75% of base
                    Str         : 125% of base
                    Dex         :  50% of base
                    Con         : 150% of base
                    Mentals     :  50% of base

                  Acute: (e.g. Elf, Owl, Cat)
                    Armour Class:  50% of base
                    Hit/Pen     :  50% of base
                    Phyiscals   :  50% of base
                    Mentals     : 200% of base

  - And, finally, the tiers the Necromancer has spent points on in their
    areas of research will result in the final  stats, combat numbers,
    and skill levels for the minion.

It is reasonable to conclude that for optimized combat, the player
is likely to select either a savage-class minion if they are going
for a dps win, or a hardy-class minion if they are going for an
endurance win. The numbers on both of these class types will be
heavily influenced by the build that the player selects for their own
research layout. So, lets outline some possibilities below, and
discuss the pros and cons that factor into each.

    Build Concept: THE OFFENSIVE SPECIALIST
    Savage Class (Balanced Specalist, Off[10] Def[3] Tac[3] Sum[5] Sls[0])
    ========================================================================
    Stat:     str    dex    con    int    wis    dis
    Value:    200    120     72     60      1     60
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unarmed/Weapon skill    : 100
    Defence/Parry skill     : 40
    Offensive Special       : High-Powered
    Defensive Special       : None
    Tactical Special        : None
    Damage Reduction (AC)   : 29.29% (25 unarmoured natural AC)
    Hit/Pen                 : 55     (unarmed - superior weapon equivalent)
    Offensive tohit:        : 162
    Offensive pen:          : 401
    Hit Deflection:         : 0%
    Number of minions       : 4
    Cost per minion         : 5 darksouls
    Darksoul conversion rate: 7/1
    Cost to establish setup : 140 souls
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Discussion: With low hp and defensive capabilities, the player is
                trying to win by hitting hard and fast. All primary focus
                goes to 10 tier points in Offense, which boosts all stats
                to full potential, gives the boost to natural hit/pen
                up to 55 (thanks to savage class), and all minions have a
                high-powered special attack. The next big factor is the
                5th tier of Summoning which allows for 4 minions, creating
                huge power returns with the added party member. Remaining
                points are split evenly between Tactics, which allows the
                caster to have his minions initiate their own attacks, and
                Defence, which gives them a little bit of protection. The
                issue here is that the individual minions are fragile,
                (the savage class has a big reduction to armour class) and
                (much worse vs. intelligent enemies) cannot protect the
                Necromancer via move-behind. Even so, for pure grinding or
                surprise pvp, the build produces the dps of a 4-member
                team of rising-hero to hero-sized players, all of whom are
                wielding awesome weapons and have strong specials.
    ========================================================================

    Build Concept: THE DEFENSIVE SPECIALIST
    Standard Class (Balanced Specalist, Off[3] Def[10] Tac[5] Sum[3] Sls[0])
    ========================================================================
    Stat:     str    dex    con    int    wis    dis
    Value:     96     96    160     80      1     80
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unarmed/Weapon skill    : 40
    Defence/Parry skill     : 100
    Offensive Special       : Weak
    Defensive Special       : Stun
    Tactical Special        : None
    Damage Reduction (AC)   : 50.00% (50 unarmoured natural AC)
    Hit/Pen                 : 32     (unarmed - average weapon equivalent)
    Offensive tohit:        : 104
    Offensive pen:          : 141
    Hit Deflection:         : 25%
    Number of minions       : 3
    Cost per minion         : 7 darksouls
    Darksoul conversion rate: 7/1
    Cost to establish setup : 147 souls
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Discussion: This build relies upon throwing up enough defense to be
                able to hold out long enough for a modest amount of damage
                to take effect against the enemy. Because the ability to
                deal some damage is important here, we select a standard
                class of npc rather than hardy. Additionally, the 3rd tier
                of offense provides weak specials. The key here is in the
                specials brought on by the 10 tiers of the Defence area of
                research. The stun specials performed by three different
                minions will stack somewhat, extending the delay of the stun
                longer than if there were just one. When the opponent is not
                stunned, 1/4th of all hits will be deflected. As such, there
                is likely to be a great deal less damage coming toward the
                team than what the team is going to be dishing out, even with
                its modest 3rd tier of Offense. The 5 tiers in tactics are
                essential to allow the Necromancer to hide behind his
                shields. The 3 tiers in Summoning produce 3 minions to keep
                the defense going. This build works best against a single
                opponent which can be effectively daunted by the stun and
                deflection combo. Decent for pvp, as well. The problem will
                be vs. teams, especially of players, who will be able to
                quickly overwhelm the defense and throw down the minions.
    ========================================================================

    Build Concept: THE TACTICAL SPECIALIST
    Hardy Class (Severe Specalist, Off[1] Def[5] Tac[10] Sum[5] Sls[0])
    ========================================================================
    Stat:     str    dex    con    int    wis    dis
    Value:    100     40    180     40      1     40

    Defensive Special       : None
    Tactical Special        : Move-behind rotation
    Damage Reduction (AC)   : 86.90% (60 natural AC + best gear in game)
    Hit/Pen                 : 60 (gear dependant)
    Offensive tohit:        : 42
    Offensive pen:          : 161
    Hit Deflection:         : 0%
    Number of minions       : 4
    Cost per minion         : 5 darksouls
    Darksoul conversion rate: 7/1
    Cost to establish setup : 140 souls, excellent gear
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Discussion: This setup has some similarities to the Def. Build, but
                relies on tactics rather than defensive skills or specials.
                Here, all bets are placed on the benefits of full tactical
                research. Most importantly, the zombies now can make use of
                weapons and armour, like any other player. This opens a wide
                pandora's box, in which the balance of the gear itself 
                becomes as much a factor as that of the guild and its powers.
                Because we bank on gear, the offense tier is mostly ignored,
                sacrificing any offensive special for the power of a wielded
                superior weapon. Because weapon power is substandard when
                compared with the power of guild specials, we must tilt our
                build even further toward lasting longer in the fight. For
                this reason, we select a hardy-class zombie, giving an
                important boost to both constitution and natural armour class.
                Here, again, gear comes into play, stacking the best stuff
                the game offers onto the already excellent AC provided by
                the zombie itself. With full tactics in play, tier 9 of that
                area allows for the zombies to do a move-behind rotation
                based on how hurt they are, much like the emyn arnen trolls.
                For this reason, we spend 5 points in the summoning tier to
                give us 4 minions for that rotation. This results in the 
                stand-off dynamic, in which the player is safely hidden 
                behind tactical minions who do low damage very slowly, but
                can hopefully last long enough to prevail. Without good gear,
                this build is hopeless.

    Discussion: This is the classic zombie horde concept. All thought for
                defence is sacrificed for standard damage brought forth
                by as many minions as fast and as cheaply as possible. Much
                like in zombie movies, the opponent is faced with attackers
                who are fragile, and go down quickly, but there are ... just
                ... so ... many of them! No defence results in only 15 AC,
                supported by a measly 20 defence skill and a dreadful 60
                constitution. The combat skills of the minions are only very
                average, at 60 in unarmed. The trouble comes in the fact
                that their hit/pen are at 50, so this feels like being
                attacked by a horde of adventurer-level players who are all
                wearing no armour, and poorly skilled, but who happen to
                be wielding sardonyx katanas, every one. What is more, each
                has a weak layman-level special attack. Because the whole
                purpose of the build is to keep the army big, one point is
                actually spent here in the Souls area, bringing down the
                conversion cost to create darksouls by 1. Because zombies
                are only one darksoul apiece to summon, the cost to create
                and maintain the build is manageable even when losses are
                to be expected fairly regularly. Tier 5 in tactics lets the
                Necromancer hide behind the mob and command from the back in
                safety.

    Discussion: Here we have the generalist at work, jack of all trades and
                master of none. Standard power in all minion-based research
                ensures decent attack power, equal to a good weapon with
                fair skill to back it up. Defence is decent, equalling good
                armour being worn and very good skills. Weak layman-style
                special attacks supplement the modest damage potential, and
                the 4 minions do a fair job working together. Tactics allow
                the caster to hide behind the minions to keep himself safe,
                and the single leftover point in Soul Science keeps the cost
                of the army lower than any specialist other than Summon Bld.

Important to remember: The zombie minions do *all* damage in combat. The
                       Necromancer himself has newbie stats and skills and
                       cannot help with the situation without greatly
                       risking his own death. There are no damage or nuke
                       spells - rather, these minions and their abilities
                       described above are the entirety of the combat aid
                       that the guild provides.
