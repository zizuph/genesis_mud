    Combat Aid
    ----------
    Using the Genesis Specials system, we simply set the combat aid
    and all other calculations are set. Slam has been set to a combat
    aid of 45%.
        
    Frequency
    ---------
    Gore has a frequency of an average of 25 seconds.
        
    Hit chance
    ----------
    Tohit is set to be 85. This is calculated to be 78% hit chance
    according to 'man cb_tohit'.
    
    Penetration
    -----------
    Penetration is calculated using the person's strength, and
    guild stat stats portion, and the Gore skill for the
    skill portion of it. Of course, penetration also depends on the
    weapon's pen. 

    Everything else is calculated by the Genesis Specials system.
