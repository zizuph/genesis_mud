Holding file for formulas relating to how the property live_i_quickness
applies to combat and combat aid:

/*
 * Old Haste formula:
 *
 * Haste spell formula adding quickness:
 *
 * aid = (aid * 85 / 100)
 * haste = (500 * aid) / (100 + aid)

2018-11-19: The formula has now been changed to the following:

This formula does not use dimnishing return like the old formula, 
meaning a caid value should equal what it is. The calculation is based
on the assumption that the maximum caid a player can have is 250 (100
white hits, 100 occ, 50 lay). This will differ for casters due to the
penalties they suffer, like component and mana drain. We do not take
this into account as faster casting equates to an equally increased
penalty.

The formula is: (caid * 250 / (250 - caid))

Due to the current haste cap of 120% we have decided to set a cap on
this haste formula, the cap is 150caid which would equal 100% increase
in attack rate.

Here is an example of how the formula is applied on actual numbers:
Haste: 50caid * 250 / (250 - 50caid) = 62,5haste
%Increase: 62,5 * 100 / 250 = 25% on all caid
Total caid: 250 - 50 = 200 + 25% = 250 caid

As haste doesnt follow a linear distribution, a formula is used to
increase the haste value to match the percentage of the caid. In the
above example, the 50caid would not have returned 62,5 haste, but an
even 100 haste, which in turn would have applied in a non-linear
fashion, resulting in a 25% increase in speed.

Formula is:
haste * ftoi(1.0 + (F_SPEED_MOD(haste) - 0.5) *
            (1.9 * (F_SPEED_MOD(haste))))


As demonstrated in the above formula, the player has 250 caid minus a
50caid ability which is used for haste. The 50 caid ability equals a
25% increase on all of his or her other abilities and white hits. This
means he or she has a total of 200 caid to be affected by the haste.
The effect of 25% on the remaining 200caid equates to 50caid, which was
originally invested in the haste ability.

At this point in time, no racial guild may utilize their 25 caid for
combative purpose, if there comes a time when racial guilds utilize
their caid, then we can easily alter the formula to take into account
that caid, should this be seen as a desirable change.
Example: (caid * 275 / (275 - caid))
