In testing the recode of the Monks of the Dragon Order, wearing 
2 shields seems to be equivalent to something around 50 combat 
aid (i.e. ~33% damage reduction).

A 40 AC standard shield reduces damage by 22-25%.

So by the standard calculation, each shield should be 20-25 CAID
benchmarked by the 40 AC shield.
