Holding file for formulas relating to how intoxication applies to 
combat and combat aid:

Mercade over-estimated the benefit of the Rockfriend's 30% faster healing
through increased intox to equate to 6% combat aid.

Carnak has estimated the Union loose roughly 70% potential increase in
their natural health regen (assuming restricted to completely sober)... 
so using the same formula the Union have a 14 caid healing disadvantage.
