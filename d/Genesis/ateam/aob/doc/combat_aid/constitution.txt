Holding file for formulas relating to how constitution applies to combat
and combat aid:

========================
OGRE STAT MODIFICATIONS:
========================
All stats are flatlined to human levels, and then special ogre
modifications are applied. Those that benefit the ogre are listed
below with combat aid/tax calculations applied:

Con:      100 increases to 130. Hitpoints increase from 1900 to 2500
          (32% increase). Thus, a player taking 100 hitpoints of damage
          loses 1/25 (4%) rather than 1/19 (5.3%) of their hitpoints.

          According to Cotillion, the fight becomes 32% longer, which
          we translate into combat aid.
          Combat aid : 32%


BERSERK (Uses skills SS_BERSERK)
    Berserk is a special that enhances the Strength, Constitution, and
    Discipline of the Gladiator. Each is boosted so that the F_STR_FACTOR
    adjustment will equal an increase of 6% for a short
    time. The berserk lasts approximately 50 seconds, with a 5 second
    preparation time, and a 10 second cooldown. That means that the
    boost only lasts for 50/65 of the time. So the actual boost over
    time is should be reduced by the 50/65 percentage..
    
    With all three stats boosted, the charge special as well as normal
    attacks are boosted. Using the F_STR_FACTOR formula, we can
    see that boosted stats are granting a 4.6% combat aid.
    (6% aid * 50 / 65)

    Additionally, boosting con gives approx 15% temporary increase in
    hit points. This translates to approximately a 13% combat aid.
    (100 / ((100 - 15% increase) * 50 / 65))
    
    Therefore, Berserk grants the gladiator an approximate 17.6%
    combat aid.
