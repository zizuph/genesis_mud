Holding file for formulas relating to how wisdom applies to combat
and combat aid:

At-will harm spells check WIS in determining query_spell_weapon_class
which is used in determining F_PENMOD spell strength.  

Mana regeneration formula checks WIS.            

A caster's WIS is used in F_STR_FACTOR calculations for spell pen 
(we allow spells to scale 10% up/down depending on wisdom).   

Stats play a minor role in determining casting success, with equal 
weighting of INT, WIS, and DIS.
