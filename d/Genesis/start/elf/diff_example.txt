/d/Dville/caution/elf/room/vill_park_2
You are standing in the park, surrounded by huge oaks, under which
soft, green grass gently billows. Here and there are flowering bushes,
and towards the center of the park you can glimpse the House of
Meditations.
  Here a small path winds its way beneath the oaks. To the southwest it
leads to the center of the park, while it leads out of the park to the
northeast.
There are two obvious exits: southwest, northeast.
> exa house
The House of Meditations is a circular building of white marble. The
red granite roof streches out to an outer circle of marble pillars
surrounding the walls. Arched doorways leads to the interior hall, and
high, narrow window openings gives it air and light.
> exa bush
The bushes blooms with rich and colourful exotic flowers. The gardeners
have selected each one from a faraway location according to what
beneficial influence its precense has on the resting mind.
