      IMPORTANT: Guidelines for the use of the <ntell> command
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Genesis doesn't allow chatlines. The <ntell> line, therefore, should *NOT*
be used for:

      * idle conversations               * greeting friends
      * forming teams                    * guiding people around  
      * full quest solutions             * asking about items
        (general hints are okay          * role-playing 
        as long as they are not           (role-playing is encouraged in all
        too obvious)                       other parts of Genesis, but this 
                                           is an out of character help line)

Rather, this is the intended useage:

   For newbies:  - asking questions about things you don't understand,
                   specifically related to how to play the game, what
                   commands do, how to get started, where to find more
                   information, quest hints, etc.
                 - thanking people for their answers

   For helpers:  - answering questions that are asked, so long as they
                   are about learning how to play the game.
                 - greeting newbies (not friends) you see and letting
                   them know you are listening should they have any
                   questions.
                 - politely correcting people who use the line improperly.
                 - Also note that the line is for helping newbies only, 
                   newbie helpers are NOT allowed to ask other helpers 
                   questions.
