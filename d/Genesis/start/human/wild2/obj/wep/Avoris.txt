Avoris
------

   A long time ago, an aged adventurer decided to retire, building himself
   a mansion on the hills overlooking Sparkle. His years of adventuring
   had left him with a great deal of wealth, but also with a sore and
   rapdily failing body. Having been a reknowned swordsman in his youth,
   during his adventuring days he had also managed to learn a little of
   the magical arts from a secretive collective known only as the 'Mystics'.

   Taking his beloved blade 'Avoris', the adventurer attempted to lay an
   enchantment upon it which would make his broken body strong once again should
   he have need to take up a sword. The spell created a huge spark of light
   and left the bright steel darkened and black. Not being a master of magical
   arts, his magic was able to make him as strong as he was at his peak
   in his youth, but unbeknownst to the adventurer, the magic would 
   begin to fade for people who were already that strong and would eventually
   become useless for anyone who was already much stronger.

   Long after the adventurer had died nameless and alone, bandits ransacked
   the ruins of his home and one of the bandits, Origan by name, discovered
   the blade hidden in the rubble. Origan found himself suddenly much stronger
   and was able to beat his fellow bandits into submission becoming their
   leader by force of arms. Origan has no knowledge of his favoured possession,
   not even knowing its name, but it has served him well in his quest to
   become a threat to the poor townsfolks and merchants who visit Sparkle.

   - Sword functionality -

   The sword is a single-handed slashing sword, wieldable only in the right
   hand. The sword has a hit/pen of 33/33 and a strength bonus designed for
   newbies. For players with a stat average of 50 and under, there will be a
   +20 strength bonus. This bonus will steadily decline until the player
   reaches a stat average of 70, after this point, the sword will provide
   no strength bonus at all. This is designed to keep the sword in the hands
   of newbies, making it undesirable for larger players.
