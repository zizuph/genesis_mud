1. Is there a formal nautical term for the round wooden steering wheel
   of old-time ships? The kind of wheel that has little wooden handles
   along the rim of the wheel in which a captain can use to turn the 
   wheel. 

> Helm
> Btw. the person operating the helm is a helmsman

2. Can you tell me what a sextant is? What it looks like, how big it is,
   what it does. (I know generally what it is and does but I need a 
   more detailed description so it actually appears that I know what I 
   am talking about when I put it to code. :)

>  Sextant helps you navigate via geometry and objects in far
   distance. I can tell you more about this later.
