Subject: listing guilds and meditating.
Date   : Dec  5 1999

If you want to separate the listing guilds from meditating, you must inherit
the file /lib/guild_support.c but not call init_guild_support() from your
init() function.

Instead, in the room where you want to have the meditation, define the
following init() function:

void
init()
{
    ::init();
    add_action(gs_meditate, "meditate");
}

And in the room where you want to have the listing of guilds, define the
following init() function:

void
init()
{
    ::init();
    add_action(gs_list, "list");
}
