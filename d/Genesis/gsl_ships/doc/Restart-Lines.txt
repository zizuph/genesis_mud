        Basic Operations for Genesis ShipLines
        ======================================
        
Obtaining a Ship Controller
---------------------------       
To start with, clone yourself a ship controller so that you
can easily control the shiplines from wherever you are. The
two most important commands are <ship> and <pier>. By using
these two commands, you can get a view of all the running
ships in the realm and have the ability to start, stop,
goto, and inspect each line.

   <clone /d/Genesis/gsl_ships/control/controller>

To start, you should list the ships by typing <ship list>.
This should give you the list of ships that are in the system.
Note the status next to each of the ships. If a ship is properly
running, it will say ENROUTE or BOARDING. If it says STUCK, then
you should restart it.

Restarting a Ship
-----------------
If a mortal reports a broken ship, or you simply need to restart
it, just obtain the ID of the ship. Let's assume that the ID of
the ship is 5. Here is what you would type to get it started
again.

> ship disable 5
> ship enable 5
> ship start 5

Viewing ShipLine Timetable
--------------------------
If you want to see what the timetable is for a particular port,
you can use the command: <ship timetable portname>. For example
if I wanted to see all the lines timetable at Sparkle, I would
type this in.

> ship timetable Sparkle
