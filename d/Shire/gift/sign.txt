    
    Welcome to the Gift Wrapping Service of Frogmorton.
    Gifts are the most most important part of any party,
    next to good food and drink, and can be the difference
    between a good party and a great party. Ask any
    hobbit and they will agree.
    
    To help out anyone who has lots of gifts to wrap, we
    can wrap all your gifts for you quickly and
    professionaly for the small fee of 4 gold coins. We will
    even attach a tag to the gift for you free of charge.
    
    Here is what you must tell us so we can wrap your gift:
    
       wrap <item> with <paper #> and <ribbon #> for <recipient>
    
    That's all there is to it.
    
    <read poster> to see wrapping paper and ribbon colors.
    
    Please be patient. We wrap lots of presents in a day and
    may get yours mixed up with others. If this happens, 
    please tell Fuschia Mugwort. She's in charge of this
    little operation.

    Please Note: Hobbits get excited when they start wrapping 
    gifts. To prevent problems, if you have more than one of the 
    same item on you, put the extras in a safe place like a bag 
    or place it on the floor otherwise they may wrap all the 
    same items at once.
