Name:       Fix the Broken Pot Still

Programmed: Raymundo, Winter 2020

Problem:    Imbert, the bartender in the upstairs bar at the
            Foaming Mug, has a broken pot still. It seems the 
            pieces have been taken and used around the Shire.
            He needs the player to find the missing pieces.

Solution:   Collect an ogee, a lyne arm, a joint, a nozzle and
            a cone. Give them to Imbert and ask for your reward.

Skills:     None

Risks:      None

XP-Scale:   5,000

Remarks:    Items are hidden around the Shire. Moreover, they 
            are hidden Shire-wide, not just in Waymeet.
