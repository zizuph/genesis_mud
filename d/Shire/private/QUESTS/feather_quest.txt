Group:      3

Bit:        7

Name:       Find the Dead Shirriffe's Feather

Programmed: Dunstable, 11/5/94

Problem:    The feather quest is based on the premise that the 
            Shirriffe Pott has become waylaid by the orcs living 
            northwest of Greenfields. Evidence must be found that 
            he's either alive or dead. 

Solution:   Get quest from shirriffe in Greenfields. Go to orc 
            camp and find evidence of missing Shirriffe in orc 
            tent. Evidence is a sack and a feather, the badge 
            of Shire Shirriffes.

Skills:     Awareness >=20 + random(15)
            Location Sense >= 20 + random(15)

Risks:      Avoiding orcs and possibly death

XP-Scale:   7,500

Remarks:    This is Part II of quest from Greenfields' Shirriffe
