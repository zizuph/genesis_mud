Solution:   Go to mayor in Michel Delving and ask for quest. He

            Delving. Give plate to Cook, who lists the items she needs:

            Honey - From mayor, go w,s,enter burrow. The honey 
            is in a room south of the bedroom. Search pillows in

            burrow. No searching necessary.

            burrow. It's in a pantry. No searching necessary.

            Spoon - Located in abandoned hobbit hole in northern 
            Michel Delving. If players search walls, the building 
            will fall and them unless propped up with beam

            Bowl - Located in burrow north of Greenholm. Search 
            table in dining room. Bowl is on table in pile of dishes.

            Go to bedroom and search the dresser. If cloth is found,

            For evil players
            ----------------
            When going through the inn, the player might notice 
            a bitter dwarf. This dwarf holds a grudge against 
            the mayor and doesn't look too upstanding. If the 
            player asks him (or buy him a beer) the dwarf will 
            explain about this.  
            
            Giving him the freshly cooked pie, he will poison 
            it and give it back to the player. If the player 
            then gives this pie to the mayor, the mayor will 
            die within 15 seconds. If you follow the dwarf's 
            instructions he will have asked for a roster of 
            who is serving where in the Shire.  
            
            Once the mayor has rewarded the player and passed 
            on, his desk may be searched.  The aware player 
            will then discover a piece of paper. If he has good 
            language he will be able to read it. Return the 
            roster to the dark dwarf and the player will become 
            a bit more evil.

Skills:     Some language and awareness skills

Risks:      Possible death when searching for the spoon. The spoon 
            is hidden in an old abandoned and very dangerous hole.  
            If one is too clumsy when searching there, they will 
            cause the hole to collapse with a 75% likelihood.  The 
            75% of falling is broken up like this:

                25% instantaneous falling, 
                25% 3 second delay, 
                25% 10 second delay. 
            
            If the hole falls in on the searcher, the searcher 
            dies. If the hole is fallen in, no one less than 
            wizlevel may enter it. Those already in the hole risk 
            a 50% chance of further collapse when trying to leave.  

XP-Scale:   19,000

Remarks:    There is a safeguard here--the pie doesn't have the 
            poison itself.  The only place the poison is cloned 
            is by the mayor when he gets the poisoned pie. This 
            is to prevent mortals running around with insta-
            death poison.
