Name:       Shire Fishing Quest

Programmed: Dunstable, 7/29/95

Problem:    Bodulas, the fisherman under the bridge needs help 
            getting some items. Find the items and return to 
            him for reward.

Solution:   Go to Bodulas and ask him for quest. He will say he 
            needs a bite of chicken, some whiskey, a hook, a 
            worm, some string and a stick, all to fish with. 
            Get items and return them to him

XP-Scale:   2,000

Remarks:    Items are scattered about west Shire, between 
            Mithlond and the 'twist' in the road, Except for 
            the fishing pole. This is found north in the fields 
            west of the sigh at Bree.

            All obj locations are approximate as the objects as 
            the objects may not always spawn in the same room 
            always. And the worm moves about, too.

            Gamwich whiskey and chicken must be purchased 
            at the Stone Bows Inn at the bridge.

            Whiskey and chicken are standard cloned foods.

            Only stick near Bree works for quest; no fishing 
            poles.
