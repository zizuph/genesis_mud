Heralds of the Valar taxation doc.
Arman Kharas, May 2018

(Modified caid values 6 August 2019 - Arman)

BACKGROUND:
===========
The Heralds of the Valar are a layman clerical guild, descended from the
Hin Warrior guild created by Tricky in the early 90s, with the feel and 
history of the guild changed to fit into the more Tolkienesque
Shire of the present. 

It has further evolved since then to take on additional thematic changes 
based on concepts from Middle-Earth Roleplay source material, namely:
* MERP 2000 Rulebook 2nd Edition, and 
* the Valar and Maiar 'the Immortal Powers' guidebook,
...to now have a background, focus and mission based on:

"With the Change of the World, the Valar became further removed
from life in Endor. Travel between Middle-Earth and Aman all but
halted, except for the Elves who longed for the lands undying.
Nevertheless, the Valar and their Maia servants remained protectors
of the Balance of Things. With the rise of Sauron in the Third Age,
Darkness once again threatened to enslave all of Middle-Earth.

Manwe chose indirect means to combat the threat posed by the Evil 
One. Selecting trusted Maiar from the Order of the Wise - the 
Istari - the Vala King hoped to send emissaries to Endor who might
unite the Free Peoples and spur them to overthrow the Lord of the
Rings. 

So in T.A 1000, five Istari entered Middle Earth. Their first act
was to plant a maple seed east of Grey Havens, which was to grow to 
become the meeting place of those they would enlighten to be 
Servants of the Secret Flame - the Heralds of the Valar."

Joining eligibility
====================
Joinroom at /d/Shire/guild/heralds/room/join.c
Must have an alignment > 500 to join, and be of an acceptable race
(human, elf, half-elf, hobbit, halfling, gnome).

Gnomes and halflings have been added as being racially acceptable. The 
latter is the name hobbits are referred to by Men, originally given
to them by the tall Dunedain, so are thematically suitable.

The term Gnomes or Noldoli was briefly used in J.R.R. Tolkien's early 
work The Book of Lost Tales to describe the race of Elves that would 
become the Noldor. So while not elves or Noldor in a Genesis setting,
they would not be considered as unsuitable for membership.

Expelled if alignment drops below -100.

SPELLS TAX
==========
See summary of individual spells below.

Full spell tax descriptions, influencing factors, and conditions in 
/d/Shire/guilds/herald/doc/spell_doc.txt

COMBAT AID
==========
1% of tax will be charged for every 25% combat aid.

Max combat aid at any one time for a layman caster is 80 Caid.

Total max potential combat aid: 80
Total max potential combat aid tax: 3.2% 

While all spells are granted upon joining, combat aid of spells is 
heavily influenced by guild rank.

Combat aid for maintained spells ranges from 6 - 15 depending on
guild rank, with a maximum of three spells that offer combat aid being 
maintained or cast at any one time.

A herald may choose to 'hfocus' on one or two maintained spells, and
forgo access to the rest of their spells, for a caid boost up to
15 - 35 and 9 - 22 respectively (singular focus / dual focus).

** Note singular focus exceeds the allowable cap for layman maintained
** spells of 30 caid. This has been allowed by the AoB considering the
** limitations.

Corruption has a negative influence on a Herald's spell combat aid.
See /d/Shire/guilds/herald/doc/spell_doc.txt for specifics on how
corruption works.
