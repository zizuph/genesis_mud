Proposed recode of the Heralds of the Valar. With the rollout of the new
magic system, the Heralds guild needed to be converted over or closed.

This document is a proposal to convert the Heralds over to the new magic
system, with some additional thematical changes to the guild based on 
concepts from the Middle-Earth Roleplay source material, namely:

* MERP 2000 Rulebook 2nd Edition, and 
* the Valar and Maiar 'the Immortal Powers' guidebook.

Arman Kharas - Arch of Balance, April 2018


CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY:

The Heralds of the Valar are a layman guild, descended from the
Hin Warrior guild created by Tricky in the early 90s.

This guild has many of the same original spells, but the feel and 
history of the guild was changed to fit into the more Tolkienesque
Shire of the present, namely:

"The Heralds of the Valar serve the True Keepers of Middle-Earth.  
The Valar are the 14 most powerful holy beings chosen by Eru 
Illuvatar to ensure that his creation song, the Ainulindale, be 
brought to fruition in Arda.  The Heralds of the Valar call upon 
the Valar for aid in times of need but do not worship them, for 
the only one worthy of that is The One, Eru Illuvatar."

So a guild that takes on a quasi-role of a Maiar without being
Maiar.

Current spells do not comply with the new magic system, and are
generally considered underwhelming:

Engwagalad - Cure's poison
Haetir - Scrying
Khil - Check player's alignment
Lammen - Speak in guild language
Lissinen - Healing spell
Mel - Creates a flower
Ondo - Strengthens Herald
Palandir - Guild list
Ramar - Calls for messenger
Silme - Light spell
Vanahwesta - Peace spell

PROPOSED RECODE SUMMARY:

THEME
======
The THEME of the guild remains as is, with the following inclusion:

* The Heralds Mission:
"With the Change of the World, the Valar became further removed
from life in Endor. Travel between Middle-Earth and Aman all but
halted, except for the Elves who longed for the lands undying.
Nevertheless, the Valar and their Maia servants remained protectors
of the Balance of Things. With the rise of Sauron in the Third Age,
Darkness once again threatened to enslave all of Middle-Earth.

Manwe chose indirect means to combat the threat posed by the Evil 
One. Selecting trusted Maiar from the Order of the Wise - the 
Istari - the Vala King hoped to send emissaries to Endor who might
unite the Free Peoples and spur them to overthrow the Lord of the
Rings. 

So in T.A 1000, five Istari entered Middle Earth. Their first act
was to plant a maple seed east of Grey Havens, which was to grow to 
become the meeting place of those they would enlighten to be 
Servants of the Secret Flame - the Heralds of the Valar."

* TITLES, emotes, and guildhall all remain as is. All available 
spells will also be granted upon joining as currently is the case.

* Tolkien's work include many evocative themes, such as the 
corrupting influences of power and illegitimate magic.
Concepts like the Balance of Things are key to the concept of
the Heralds.

There are two principal dangers that help to restrain the use of
magic in the Third Age to be incorporated into the recode. 

One is the corrupting influence of the use of significant magic for 
non-pure goals. Unless a spell is cast for the purpose of combating 
Darkness or maintaining the "Balance", there is a chance the caster 
will be corrupted, "drawn towards darkness."  This is what happened 
to Sarauman - he used too many powerful spells, too often.

The other is the Shadow of Sauron of Mordor - drawing attention of 
the Lidless Eye has led to the downfall of many a spell caster.
Those who live under his eye are particularly careful not to cause
attention to be brought upon themselves. This feeling may contribute
to the restraint found in those who possess the ability to wield 
spells.

SPELLS
======
Majority of SPELLS will be converted over to the new system with a
few new additional spells included. Spells will continue to have
a link to the Vala.

Spells that won't be converted over:
Vanahwesta - peace spell - deemed an illegal spell in the new system, 
Lammen - Speak in guild language, 
Mel - create flower spell.

Restrictions on being able to cast spells on evil characters will
be removed.

Spell combat aid will be dependent on a few factors, namely being 
strongly influenced by the players guild level and a NEW concept for 
inclusion - corruption.

Corruption is a point system between 0-100 that decays over time.
It starts at zero, however can increase when a Herald uses their
power in aid of Darkness (i.e. healing an evil character or killing
a good aligned creature), or whenever a spell failure occurs there 
is a chance that the spell caster will be partially corrupted and 
"drawn towards the darkness".

Corruption reduces spell combat aid. If their effective combat aid
reaches zero they are unable to cast the spell.

If corruption levels are greater than 75, the caster becomes a 
'Fallen Herald' and will lose access to their spells. The will need
to wait until their corruption level returns to 50 before they
regain their spells and lose their Fallen title. 

COSMETIC ADDITIONS
==================
When casting spells close to areas of evil (Misty Mountains / 
Mordor / Isengard) there is a greater chance of drawing the
attention of the Dark Lord. The Herald and those with them notice
either a flight of crebain or the shrieks of black riders seeking them
out. 
* At this point it is incorporated as a cosmetic touch however may
  be fleshed out and have more of an influence to the guild. *

PROPOSED NEW SPELL LIST
=======================
New spells are marked with a *
Renamed spells are marked with a #

engwagalad      A prayer to Lorien to tend poisons and inflictions
haetir          Call upon the farsight of Manwe
*hortale        Channel the swiftness of the Mearas
khil            Call Vaire to divine the touch of Shadow
lissinen        Ask Este to heal your wounds
*namotir        Protection from Shadow magic
*noleme         Channel the wisdom of Ulmo
#nornore        Detect other Heralds in the realms
ondo            Channel the hardness of the earth
*rada           Call upon Vana to find nearby herbs
ramar           Call upon Manwe to summon a winged messenger
*riel           Create a herb garden by channelling the Earth-mother
silme           Appeal to Elbereth to light your way

SPELL TEMPLATES UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM AND SKILL REQUIREMENTS:
Instant spells:
Lissinen - heal (water/conjuration)
Engwagalad - cleanse (water/conjuration)
Khil - alignment (earth/divination)
Haetir - scry (air/divination)
Nornore - shadow (earth/divination)
Riel - plant (earth/conjuration)
Rada - locate (earth/divination)

MAINTAINED SPELLS:
Silme - light (air/conjuration)
Ramar - summon (air/conjuration)
Noleme - statboost (water/conjuration)
Hortale - haste (air/conjuration)
Ondo - stoneskin (earth/abjuration)
Namotir - Protection from death magics (earth/abjuration)

Maintained spells that require combat aid (of which there are 4)
are capped at 25 caid, and only three may be maintained at any time.

Also the heal spell is less effective if too many maintained spells are
being channelled.

A Herald may choose to 'channel' two maintained powers or one maintained
 power, forgoing access to the rest of their spells. This allows them to 
have two maintained spells active of up to 35 caid each, or one maintained 
spell active of up to 60 caid. This is managed through the hfocus 
command <singular> / <dual> / <none>.

As layman magic guilds may have up to 80 caid max, focusing on a singular
or dual option does result in less optimisation (60 and 70 max caid
respectively).

Combat aid modifiers for spells will generally follow the following
formula (modifier out of 100):

   40 + (level * 3) - corruption

So a new member of the guild using a 25 caid maintained spell with no
corruption would in effect start with only a 10 caid ability that will
grow as they progress through the ranks.

A new member focusing singularly on a maintained spell (60 caid) would
effectively have a 25 caid ability initially.

PROPOSED SKILLS AND TAX
=======================
Skills to remain largely the same, although remove LIFE spell 
element and replace with WATER and AIR. This is to better align
with the elements favoured by the greater powers... with fire
noteably absent (Melkor's focus).

Also an increase in spellcraft and herbalism by 10 each.
