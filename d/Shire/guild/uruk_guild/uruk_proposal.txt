***Uruk-hai of Middle Earth (two branches)***
*********************************************

        ***Uruks of the Red Eye***

The uruks in the service of Barad-dûr, the folk 
of Mordor, used the symbol of the Red Eye of Sauron.
The Red Eye was also painted on their shields. The
uruks of Mordor commonly referred to Sauron as the
"Great Eye". 

The guild location for these uruks will be in Lugburz,
or rather, Minas Morgul. Some of their emotes that
will be unique from the other branche of the guild may
have direct references to the nazgul and the Morgul
mages, mostly in cowering fear and respectful
deference. There will probably be a few in there
for complaining about daylight and what not.


      ***Uruks of the White Hand***

The uruks of Isengard, servants of Saruman, used an
elf-rune for the letter 'S' wrought in white metal 
on the front of their iron helms. They commonly had 
the symbol of a white hand painted in the center of
a black field on their shields.

The guild for the uruks of the White Hand will be
located in or near Isengard. They are bent to the will
of Saruman, obeying his word to the letter. Their
unique emotes will mostly be comments about serving
the will of Saruman, joys of pillaging and scoffing
at the sun.



               ***General***
Most likely both branches will have the same trainable
skills. 

They will have a few general emotes that will be the
same, but each will have emotes unique to their locale
and allegiance. 

All uruks can speak in the black tongue, which is also
understood and spoken by members of the orc guild located
in the Shire domain. (and I am toying with the idea of
letting the Mage guild understand this speech as well).

I am still brainstorming for some of the special role
play enhancing items/abilities similar to what I gave
the orcs.
