Greetings,

The Smiths of Bree are now a Craft style guild.

You still have your guild experience, quantity of items forged, title etc.
Because the Smiths are now a Craft guild, your weapons skills earned
through the layman Smiths guild will start to decay.

You are now free to pursue a layman guild if you wish.


Smiths Improvements:

 - Smiths may now forge shields
 - Improved appraise object skill
 - Lowered guild tax

We have some exciting ideas for the Smiths we hope to implement in the
near future and hope you enjoy your time in Bree.

If you have any problems, leave a bug report in the forges or mail
the guild master, Palmer.

If you are already in a Craft guild and wish to re-join Smiths you'll
have to quit the other Craft guild first. For a limited time you can
visit Bores after quitting the Craft guild and 'transfer' with no
penalty.

Your necklace may look a little dull. The next time you awake it should
be back to normal.
