Long  ago, in  Durin's  days,  a  great  many  runes  were
placed  on  dwarven   dwellings  like  the Lonely Mountain, 
Erebor, and in Moria, Khazad-dum.

The Craft of Rune-making is simple, so long as you remember 
where the Power of Runes come from. The most common form of 
Rune Power  is  Moonbeams, but some Mirrors will suffice in 
Royal Hands.

Another  restriction placed on Runes is that they only work
for a limited Time, depending on the Power of the Runemaker.

The Power of Mirrors  is such that anything made with Runes
through  their Medium is not allowed to be brought near the
Mirror itself, lest its Power unmake the Runed Object.

Runes of Opening are made by similar Processes, though they
are  much more difficult than ordinary Runes, for they must
also have Runes of Closing in order to work.

Finally, on the Topic of Runes of Power I have this to say.
The  Runes  of  Power possessed  by Dwarves  are  the  most 
powerful  in all this World, and strong enough to keep  any 
Dwarven Enemy astray, unless whereto the Dwarves want  them
to go. We will be safe as long as the  Craft of Rune Making
does not pass out of our Knowledge.

                 Bombir the Tall, Rune Maker of Khazad-dum.
