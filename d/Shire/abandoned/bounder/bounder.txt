              members basic skills and abilities with little
              restrictions. Members are essentially scout
              militia, mainly hobbits although the hobbits are
              known to accept other races (no goblins of course)
              which may be their downfall (scouring of the shire).
Restrictions: No goblins, no alignment below zero, each member
              must bring in a quota of orc scalps or wolf hides.
Council:      No council, members may be expelled by a majority
              vote within 4 days, the expulsion must have 3
              secondings from members of 50 guildstat or higher.
              Same applies for application to the guild, it must
              be submitted by a member of 50+ gStat, and seconded
              by 3 of the same.

Guild Specials:
              Sweep - sweep is a polearm specific combat special,
              giving the bounder the ability to trip-up or knock
              down an opponent where are are disadvantaged in
              defending themselves.
              Sweep will add a negative skill adjustment to the
              victim's defence skill for a short period, until
              able to get to his/her feet.

              Ambush - ambush is a non-combat special, allowing
              Bounders to set themselves up in hiding, waiting
              for an intruder into Shire boundaries. This ability
              has come from instruction by odd grey-cloaked men
              who are sometimes seen assisting the Watch and
              their Bounders in ridding the lands of pestillence.
              Ambush special raises the effectiveness of the
              Bounder's hide as if they were of level 70 profic-
              iency, 20 levels above their trained level.
              The hide doesnt activate until 30 seconds after
              issuing the command, and is removed if the player
              moves or is revealed or attacked.
