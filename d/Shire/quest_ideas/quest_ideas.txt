Ranger in Prancing Pony:
For many years the Dunedain lived in the fair lands of Cardolan. It was a division of Arnor and founded in the TA 861. However, the witch-king Angmar waged war against us. We bravely fought him, but were overwhelmed and retreated south to the Barrow Downs, the sacred burial grounds of the first men of Middle earth. While he sought us out and destroyed us, his corrupting hand tainted those who rested in peace, but sadly, they never were able to. He raised the souls and imprisoned them to do his bidding.  During while of our last battles, the last prince of Cardolan was killed by the witch-king. In malevolent mockery, he raised the corpse. Curses to the witch-king! Curses to him! The poor soul needs to be put to rest. Please put him out of his misery, for he wanders somewhere in the barrows. Some say they have seen him surrounded by other souls, so it may be dangerous. Do not put yourself in danger for you may fall under their spell, but be do be careful. When you have put his soul to rest, bring back proof and I shall be forever grateful for your kind deed.

Cleanse the Downs
Go kill each of the Kings in the Downs and bring back proof you have killed them to the ranger in the PP.
Worth abt 40k exp

So, you want to help me? Can I trust you? <check alignment> Hmm...I'm not sure, but I'll give you a small asignment. If you prove yourself, I may give you a more dangerous task. Here is what you must do. I'm expecting some 'friends' from the south. Go to the gate and keep an eye out for them. when they enter Bree, come back and tell me. I may have more work for you later.

I guess I Can trust you with a more dangerous task. Go to the gatekeeper and spy on him. He seems to be robbing me blind. He's suppose to give me some of the fees he's collecting, but hasn't. Find out why.

I have a news that must go to Sharkey. I dare not trust my spies here and I must keep an eye on Bree. Take this report to him, and return with any other instructions from him.
