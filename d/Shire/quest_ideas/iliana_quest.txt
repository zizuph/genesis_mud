Ok this is kind of rough, so please don't laugh to hard. :)

This has a part of those of evil align and those of good align. The part for
evil will be in ().


Go to Rivendell (Annuminas) where you locate Bilbo (Goblin) who ponders about
old battles and such. 

Bilbo (Goblin) wonders what happened to his wonderful "Sting" (that cursed
blade sting).

You go get sting. (already avaiable in that cave with trolls south of Moria)

Return to Rivendell (Annuminas) and present "Sting" to Bilbo (Goblin). Upon
wielding it Bilbo (Goblin) notices it needs to be sharpened and asks for a
rock. (available all over Shire)

Give stone to Bilbo (Goblin) who then ponders as wielding blade and sword
fighting shadows, What happened to the Mithril-Mail. Now be my figuring, it
should be in Ciroth Ungol at this point after the orcs fight over it and Frodo
gets away. So you have to go there to find it.

Got get Mithril-Mail, not sure it exists yet. This might have to be added.

Return to Bilbo (Goblin) and as he begins to celebrate, a bright light appears
and Gandalf steps out and takes the amours and "Sting" away. Sting returns to
that troll cave, and Gandalf is supposed to retrieve the Mithril-Mail for
Frodo anyway. 

Player gets xp.
