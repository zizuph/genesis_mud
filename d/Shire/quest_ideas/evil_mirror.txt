Ugly Witch/Sorceress
----------------------
If you have come to ask me to break the spell on that woman, never!!! She stole my lover from me, and now I have done the same to her. I could change my mind, if I had my youth and beauty back.

I am so old, I am so ugly, I could never let her see me like this. She still thinks I'm handsome and love me still. Foolish woman. The only thing left to remind me of how I looked before is this mirror. It shows me what I use to look like, but alas, even that is a lie.

Oh my, she was right! I am handsome!! What was I thinking? This cursed mirror is evil and should be destroyed! Here, take this terrible, terrible mirror and destroy it! No one else should fall under its spell.

Give mirror to Ugly Witch/Sorceress
