make a road to archet, and also some houses there.
Make some hobbits in some real live houses there.

The place must have a quest before opening!

Archet16.c	- Archet. Outside a small cottage. Here a timberman will live.
				He has trouble with cutting some wood for his fire and need 
				some help. Go to Archet11n and enter the forest there.
				You will come to a tree, which suits you, cut it down and 
				carry it with you to him. He will then tell you that he 
				cant light the fireplace with a whole tree. Maybe an idea
				to go find a saw, and cut the tree in nice, suitable pieces.
				EXP - Something around 2000xp I guess. Rather easy. Might
				be hard to find the right place to enter. Might be hard to
				know that you need to cut the tree. Need awareness > 40.
