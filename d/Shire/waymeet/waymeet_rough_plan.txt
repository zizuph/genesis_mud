	 IDEAS
	 ======
	 6-10 smials 
		--Ray
	------------------	
	A shop that sells physical parchments or scrolls. 
	Notes that you can hand deliver instead of sending
	as mail or pigeons. 
	
	The plan I have is to make players write the scroll
	in the shop. They cannot just buy a bunch of blanks
	and walk around.
	
	I'm considering placing the shop in a hidden entrance
	beneath a hobbit smial (in the basement).
	
	Rough draft of the scroll is in :
		/d/Shire/waymeet/obj/scroll_2.c
	
	issues:
		There is no side border on the scroll (is that a problem? 
		It might look funny if players don't format correctly).
		
		The scroll currently resets when it saves. It should not
		reset (or else maybe it shouldn't save?).

	-----------------------
	
	I see Farmer Maggot had 3 dogs that would scare off bad elements
	or whatnot (didn't work on nazguls though). Maybe we can have
	dogs or maybe the sherif(sp?) and dogs show up randomly when
	people attack hobbits and the dogs and sherrif can hunt the 
	players. It'd add a little spice to killing hobbits.

	---------------------------
	
	Also, if we're having dogs, we could get really out there and
	code an uruk somewhere who's missing a hand. The story is
	he tried to raid the waymeet and the dogs bit his hand off.
	he wants his hand back!
	
	kill the dogs
	cut them open
	cut open the intestines or stomache
	find the hand (random drop)
	maybe the hand even has a diamon or a gold ring
		but before you can sell the ring, you'd need to
		wash it in the river (smells bad, having been inside the
		dog).
		
	issues
	------
	is this too far out there for a shire quest? Don't wanna upset
	the apple cart.
