Thanks, I've started going through the two quests. Initial feedback for the
wolf quest:
/d/Shire/waymeet/rooms/path_3
add_item needed for farm
***
fixed
***
/d/Shire/waymeet/npcs/boso
Two 'my's in the sentence... typo, should be 'wolves in my fields':
The grumpy hairy-footed male hobbit shouts: Not just any wolf, mind you, but
the
wolves my my fields. I WANT THEM DEAD!
***
FIXED
***
Can we change references of '10' to 'ten'?
***
FIXED
***
Can we add an add_ask about fields... it isn't clear which fields are his.
I would have assumed only the field next to his farm is his field. But the
only place I found wolves was in Reginard's field??  Maybe change his message
above to kill wolves that roam between his and Reginard's fields?
***
Changed the quest to say fields near waymeet
***
Do enough wolves clone for this quest?
Exploring both fields only resulted in me finding two wolves.
What's sort of cloning do we get in this area?
***
Upped the clone rate of wolves just to be sure there'd be
enough. Should be plenty now.

Really? Going through the code there is at least three required parts for the
quest to work that have been commented out.
It does not work in its current state.
Can you walk me through how you stress tested this quest?
A.K
***
The areas that are commented out (and the two new versions of rooms
waiting for release) are because the areas are currently live, in game. 
Finwe and I discussed it and agreed that making changes to the live area 
before Waymeet was approved would be confusing to players who found items
that had no where to go.

Too long message. More automatically invoked!

Hi Finwe and Varian,
Some feedback on the still quest:
In general:
XP feels a bit low... it is a tough one to figure out if you don't have
a walkthrough... a lot of searching across the Shire. Some general skills
required, and likely minor combat against the road ruffians. I'd bump
it up to 5,000xp.

/d/Shire/eastroad/western/foam_mug_2020
in the block_people function it doesn't allow people to go up.
That needs to be fixed (there is a check for completing the quest missing..
it defaults to block).
******
	if(TP->query_prop(JUNIPER)| CHECK_QUEST(TP, "fix_still"))
	{
		write("The bartender winks at you and you know you are allowed to "
			+ "go upstairs.\n");
		say("The bartender winks at " + QCTNAME(TP) + ", letting " 
			+ HIM_HER(TP) + " know it's OK to go upstairs.\n");
		return 0;
	}
It returns 0 (allowing you to go up) if you've done the quest or gathered the juniper berries.
******

As this is a room that requires exploration by the player to work
out parts of the quest, we need to be very detailed with our
descriptions. So we need add_items for:
* 'window' / 'closed (or open) window' / 'large closed (or open) window'
***
added
***

[from examining the chandelier]
* 'metal cone' / 'cone' / 'copper cone'
* 'chain' / 'long chain'
* 'ball' / 'metal ball'
-- More -- 30/120 -- (<cr> t b r n a <num> q x !<cmd> h ?) -- 
* 'poles' / 'metal poles'
***
Fixed
***

There is no hint in the long description that directs you to look
at the ceiling (finding the chandelier). At least include some
commentary in the long description about the ceiling so that there
is a prompt for people to examine it.
***
added a chandelier line
***

To get the cone, you need to be intoxicated. This will restrict
Union members potentially, and undead who can't drink (Morgul Mages).
You should think how you wish to address this. We want to avoid
making quests these days that are exclusive to certain guilds.
***
added an awareness possibility. It's high (at 75) but there are 
items and herbs that can raise awareness enough.
***

When you remove the bolts:
"You reach up, pull the bolts off, and remove the copper cone.
It was a bit tricky getting everything through the hole, but you
managed OK."  Can we change OK to okay.
***
changed
***


/d/Shire/eastroad/village/whit/whithouse2
Can we fix the formatting of the new code please?
Uncomment exa closet code.
Uncomment the add_prop to allow the closet to be searched.
***
The code is commented because it's a live room and not released yet.
It will be uncommented concurrently with opening Waymeet.
***

/d/Shire/bree/rooms/road/attic1
This room needs to be magic mapped.
Can we fix the formatting of this room please.

Arg. Again with the tab box. Why does the notepad++ update
uncheck the tab to spaces box? Annoying. Anyway, that's fixed.
Junk added.

For the climb_lattice function can we change the fail message to
let them know they hurt themselves from falling, seeing we are
taking health from the player?
***
added OUCH! That hurt!
***

/d/Shire/bree/rooms/road/broad06
Need to add some clues here about the secret path around the side of
the AG.
****
broad06_new has those hints. I didn't want to change a live room until
the area was approved to be opened. It will be ranamed as broad06 when 
everything opens
****

/d/Shire/longbottom/rooms/smials/5_cellar
Before I can allow for the opening of the quest I need to review
-- More -- 90/120 -- (<cr> t b r n a <num> q x !<cmd> h ?) -- 
[Finwe link-died]
Longbottom, as one of the quest items is there.
***
agreed. The areas will (hopefully) open together.
***

/d/Shire/frogmorton/smial01a
The quest doc says the nozzle is in this room.
I can't find where in the code the nozzle is to be found?
****
smail01a_2020 is the placeholder file. Sorry.
When the area is approved, i'll rename it to smial01a 
which is why the doc is written that way.
****



/d/Shire/eastroad/npc/imbert
Can we include an add_ask for 'pieces' that gives the player
an idea of how many pieces are left for them to find.
***
fixed

LONGBOTTOM INITIAL REVIEW
Missing a "." at the end of one of the room tells.
A gentle breeze blows across the land
/d/Shire/ns_road/rooms/road12
The ruffians should only block from one direction. Considering
it is right next to a newbie hunting zone it becomes a death
trap for them.
Check "_live_o_last_room" prop the room the player entered, and
have the exits block depending on the direction they came from.
(actually an easier prop to check is "_live_s_last_move",
so check for their last movement string.
