Hi Raymundo and Finwe,
I've had a preliminary review of Waymeet and have a few comments. Primarily
there is a lot of incorrect indentation throughout all the code... some
makes me think the code was created in the game editor?
I have a feeling the hobbitmaker.c for Waymeet isn't working as intended.
A lot of the hobbit npcs are spawning as the default with no equipment,
regardless of what type of hobbit they are set as. You should look into
that.
The other thing that was missing was quest documentation. That definitely
needs to be provided before we can open this area.
Anyway, the following is some more specific feedback:
/d/Shire/waymeet/arms/
diaper.c
Some weird format indentation throughout. Needs to be tightened up to align
with
'man code_standards'
****
DONE
****

h_anklet.c
-- More -- 30/123 -- (<cr> t b r n a <num> q x !<cmd> h ?) -- 
Indentation for add_name needs fixing.
****
DONE
****

h_bracelet.c
Descriptor header says it is a diaper, not a bracelet.
Rather than use TP->query_gender() == 0 in the wear function, can we please
inherit <const.h> and replace the above with TP->query_gender() == G_MALE
Again, some weird format indentation. Needs to be fixed up.
****
DONE
****
wolf_pelt.c
Indentation for set_af needs fixing.
****
DONE
****

/d/Shire/waymeet/food/apple_pie.c
Indentation for add_adj needs fixing.
****
DONE
****

/d/Shire/waymeet/lib/
In general fine, although throughout the lib files the indentation needs
to be fixed to align with 'man code_standards'
***
The issue with indenting appears to be that i didn't check the box
that said use spaces (or whatever exactly it is) in preferences in 
the tab settings in Notepad++. It's fixed, and a search/replace
seems to have fixed the issue. DONE
***

base_field.c
pick_vegetable function is missing a full stop when you complete the
command:
"You reach out and pick a large carrot from the field"
***
DONE
***
waymeet_hobbitmaker.c
Curious what the reason is for the customised hobbitmaker? Is that
for the dog summoning code?
****
Yes, exactly. I copied and adjusted the hobbitmaker so that I 
could add dogs to waymeet and not the whole shire. 
****

/d/Shire/waymeet/npcs/
boso.c
Can we make sure we provide some detail in the code header that
this is a quest npc, direct to where the quest documentation is
kept? (probably /d/Shire/private/QUESTS/)
1000 quest xp seems reasonable
****
DONE
****

dippity.c
Typo in the long description ("which seem slike")
****
DONE
****


/d/Shire/waymeet/obj/
chandelier_cone.c
References a quest, but I can't find any documentation on the Foaming Mug
Inn quest? Or quest bits?
****
/d/Shire/private/QUESTS/fix_still.txt
documentation updated.

Also, the foam_mug_quest.txt will be removed as soon as the quest goes live. It was a reference file for me so I didn't forget where everything was stashed as we worked through the quest.
***

scroll_2.c
Typo in the do_destroy function. "You destory"
****
DONE
****

novel_wheel.c
Extra space in long description "see a slot  on the"
****
DONE
****

token.c
Needs a "\n" at the end of set_long
****
DONE
****


/d/Shire/waymeet/rooms/
In a number of the smials and rooms, the hobbits spawn without equipment. Is
that deliberate? I have the feeling they aren't spawning properly..
they all seem to default with a stat average of 50 regardless of their
type setting.
*****
FIXED the hobbitmaker
*****
-- More -- 90/123 -- (<cr> t b r n a <num> q x !<cmd> h ?) -- 
path_1.c
Has an invisible exit for the southwest. Is there a reason it is
non-obvious?
****
This exit is part of a joint quest between Waymeet and Cairn Andross (did I spell that right?) and the non-obvious exit seems to add just a little more challenge to the quest. Did you have long description on? did you read the add_items?

The majority of the quest is handled in C.A. Here, the player brings a letter and leaves with a crate of tobacco. Everything else is in C.A.
****

h_1_8.c
Has an extreme level of darkness set for this room... -100? That is
excessive for magical darkness, let alone normal darkness.
Please reduce. I would suggest inheriting /sys/const.h and have
it set to DARKNESS_PASSIVE
****
Set darkness to -1.
DONE
****


foam_mug_2020.c
fix_still quest doesn't seem to be showing on
"Call /d/Shire/sys/global/quest_master list bits"
As mentioned above, quests need to be documented. It isn't clear the
reward for this quest (or even if it works?)
For Finwe to action:
/d/Shire/open/QUEST needs to be updated. Currently doesn't direct
to where quest documentation is stored.
/d/Shire/private/QUESTS/ needs the LIST file updated, as well as
documentation added for all live quests, including the Waymeet wolves
quest and Fix Still quest.
Can you stress test the quests please and provide confirmation they
work as intended?
