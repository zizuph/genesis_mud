All entrances, except for p23 have tent entrances

Inside
The tent is dark and dirty. Some light comes in through the tent flap 
and filters in from the teant seams. Crudely constructed furniture is 
spread around the tent and piles of debris are scattered about.

Outside
You stand between some tents of this orc outpost. Various paths that lead 
between the tents are well worn from all the orc activity. A feeling of 
nervous wait seems to pervade the outpost.
