            The White Towers are locked, locked alas!
               Lost is the key, lost in the grass
              Open the door, and inside you beware
           For things not seen can certainly be there
             Fire dies hard, dies harder when cast
             Lots of cool water are surely a must
          Atop sits the snake, the snake shall not be
            Away with its life, its present you flee
           Inside once again, you will find body part
           Alchemists transform, to help you to start
          Being victorious, cause the guardian inside
         Will try keep you down, with all of its might
        At the top you will feel, feel proud deep within
            Task almost finished, it is easy to win
        Lock the doors when you go, for it is a good habit
     Store the keys somewhere safe, perhaps close to a rabbit?
