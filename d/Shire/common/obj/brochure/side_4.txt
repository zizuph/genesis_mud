Side 4                       Pitbulls
                             --------

Pitbulls are really aggressive animals that are hard to handle. It is
not advisable for beginners to buy a Pitbulls and walk around with
them without a restraining leash and mouthpiece.

Pitbulls burn a lot of energy, but since they are small they still
eat food at intervals that lie slightly above the avarage.

If not fed enough a Pitbull can become very stubborn and unwilling to
aid his master. Some Pitbulls are known to even have attacked their
masters. People who find themselves on the wrong side of a Pitbull
had better put on some heavy armour, because the avarage jaw-pressure
of a Pitbull can measure up to 50 kilos. Such a bite hurts, believe me.
