Side 10               What to expect from a dog
                      -------------------------

All dogs we sell have had some form of training before. Some dograces
lend themselves better for aggressive actions than oher races. The
disadvantage to those races is that they are harder to control. The
more authority the owner has, the better the dog will respond to his
commands.

   Depending on the size of the dog is his appetite. Beagles, being
small animals do not eat very much, but big dog like Doberman Pinchers
consume a lot.

   In all cases will the dog assist the owner when he is attacked.
The dogs cannot stand aside when their master is in combat. There is
of course the exception when the dog is underfed, in which case his
condition prevents him to attack the opponent of his boss.
