Side 11                   What the dog expects from you
                          -----------------------------

As his owner, the dog expects from you that you provide him with
food. The thing dogs like best are the doggy-meals that are sold in
our petshops. A doggy-meal contains lots of vitamins, calcium, iron
and other minerals that keep your dog healthy for a long time.

   Dogs can also survive by eating corpses, but, being as well
trained as they are, they will wait for you to give them the command
to do so, which is saying "Gnu, eat corpse", if your dog were called
Gnu.

   Since we have come to the commands, the dogs expect you to give
them simple commands, like "Gnu, growl", or "Pet, get sword". You can
whisper the commands to your dog, or you can simply say them to him.
