Beagles are faithful companions of man. These adorable dogs have a
beautiful white, black and brown-patched fur, and have the cutest
eyes. A Beagle is not so much known for its assertivity, but more
for its faith. Unless severely neglected, a Beagle will seldomly
walk out on his keeper. From old, Beagles were used in the foxhunt.

   Beagles are very easy dogs to mend, and follow the orders of
their owners without questioning their authority. People who have
little experience with animals can easily become owner of a beagle.

   Hunger is not known among Beagles. Although they look a bit heavy,
they really do not eat much.
