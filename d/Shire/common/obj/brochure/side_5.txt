Side 5                  Dobermann Pinchers
                        ------------------

Dobermann Pinchers have always been used as guarddogs. These are
trained killermachines, bold and ruthless. A single command will
unleash these fighting machines on their opponents. It is logical
that such a dangerous dog can only be managed by a skilled owner.
The dog should have some respect for its owner, or else it will
not stay very long.

   Almost as big as the dog itself is its appetite. The dog eats
a lot and to keep it fit, you should engage in a lot of combat.

   Dobermann Pinchers are excellent partners for clerics like true
Hin Warriors. Their masters being skilled at magic and they skilled
as fighters make great teams.
