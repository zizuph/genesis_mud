If you say "kind", you say "Labrador". Labradors are real family dogs
and are always willing to help out when the owner is in trouble. If
fed enough, your Labrador will assist you in perilous times.

   Talking about the appetite of man's best friend, the Labrador is
a moderate eater, and digests his doggy-meals regularly. Doggy-meals
can be bought in our petshops.

   Being the owner of a Labrador takes some prior experience with
animals, but they are easy dogs to manage. Labradors are well-trained
and follow orders of their owners promptly.
