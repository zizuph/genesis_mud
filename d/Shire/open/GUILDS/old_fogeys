The Old Fogeys are a club, strictly for fun.
They are found in /d/Shire/common/obj/club/* and there are backups to all relevant
files. The guild offers a few emotes and a startloc at tree.c in the
above room, for guildmembers only.


The guild is restricted to males of the dwarven,
hobbitish and human races. I couldn't imagine an
Old Fogey of a different background.
