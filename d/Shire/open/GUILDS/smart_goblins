The Smart Goblins of Annuminas are the remnants of Angmar's Army
(no relation to the Rho guild, btw) who became disillusioned
after the fall of the Witchking in TA 1975. They hid out in the ruins of
Annuminas and, finding a decaying Dunedain library, began the arduous
effort towards understanding lore and whatnot. They still haven't
mastered this, over 1000 years hence, and most of their lore comes
out garbled. :) They still have a healthy disrespect for Angmar who
let them down and are opportunistic little guys. :)
The guild is restricted to goblins only.
