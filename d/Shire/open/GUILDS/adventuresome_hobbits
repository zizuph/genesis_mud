N.B. Working backups of most of the above files have been
made should an error occur and then only this would be
necessary: mv (offending file).c (offending file).buggy
mv (offending file).bak (offending file).c
This should fix problems with the shadow, soul and pipe instantly.

N.B. You must complete the entrance quest given by /d/Shire/
hobbit/doorhobbit in order to be able to join the guild.
This quest is open to all players of Genesis.
For more info on the quest, please see:

What the guild offers
---------------------
The guild offers the chance to join a hobbit family, and get a family
name: e.g. Dunstable Took.  It is a hobbit racial guild based on the
Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien and is meant to add a
roleplaying flavor to life in the Shire. The hobbits were the last
racial guild to be added in Genesis, but here's hoping it was worth
the wait! :)
The guild offers many emotes which can be found by cloning the pipe
and typing: help hobbit emotions.  The pipe will probably self-destruct
on you, so type quickly. :)
Of course you may just change your race to hobbit and join the guild normally.
The guild trains skills as listed below, has a common board, a guild board,
it's own library for the members to use, a post office, a start room, and an
inn which gives members discounts.

The guild also offers an inn where food and drink are 1/2 price,
as well the inn offers members pipe-weed which is smoked by their pipes,
which according to man guilds cost 1% tax.

Therefore the tax calculation comes to 2.67% tax.
Assigned tax will be 3%.
