Information on the Trickster layman guild.

This guild has its roots in the old Shire guild originally
coded by Tricky but basically abandonded in 1994 and 1995.
I took the guild's emotes and put them here, and split the
spells and other things with the Heralds of the Valar (q.v.)
and the Adventuresome Hobbits race guild (q.v.).
The guild embodies the happy go lucky mentality of the Hins,
while keeping them out of the realm of clerical magic.
These are to be magicians, who earn their living by hook or
by crook or even by an honest day's work if they must. :)
They practice legerdemain (to be implemented), not 'magic' aswe know it.
They have an alignment restriction of +/- 600.
This is in keeping with their 'fun is the ultimate goal' theme.
They have no time for those who serve others than themselves.
Basically, anything goes as long as you don't get caught up in some
kind of idealogical war. :)

Key files and places of interest:
/d/Shire/trickster/join.c -> This is the joining, leaving, and expelling
room (via shadow).
/d/Shire/trickster/shadow.c -> this mainly gives a title and keeps up
with who has joined a crusade and who hasn't.
/d/Shire/trickster/trick_soul.c -> The command soul.
/d/Shire/trickster/start -> Their starting location.

The guild has few special advantages as it is set under the village of
Bree.
