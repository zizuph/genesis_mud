The Noldor of Imladris
-----------------------
The Noldor are a racial elven guild located in Imladris. The guildhouse is in the northeast part of the valley next to the stone seat.

The Noldor are one of the great families of elves Arda. Yet in the Third Age, they were less numerous than in the past. Yet some remained in ME, especially in Imladris. It was in the valley they dwelt with Elrond, protecting the area and keeping watch for Sauron.

Because of their limited numbers, the guild is limited to the number of players that may join. Those who don't log in for an extended of time will be automtically removed when the game reboots.

Before joining, players must be able to cross the ford of rivendell. Afterwards, players must remain at least neutral, or 0, to remain in the guild. Failure to remain neutral or better will result in expulsion from the guild.

As a racial guild, Noldor may improve the following skills:

Abilities
-----------
There are no special abilities. As Noldor, they may see more details in the murals and paintings in Rivendell, simply because these items will reflect their history. 

It must be noted that Noldor can see the forest exits even if they haven't done Elrond's quest. This isn't a special ability because anyone will see the forest exits after doing Elrond's quest, whether regardless of their race.
