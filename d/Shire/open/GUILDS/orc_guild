O=======================================================================O

                  Created: May 2005, Altrus the crackpot
                       /d/Shire/guild/orc_guild/

This guild offers players the chance to become an orc, a previously
unavailable playable race. Through 'dark sorcery' an elf body can be
changed into the twisted orcish form, provided that elf is evil enough.
Although theme-wise it would make sense to have this guild allied with 
the dark tower, these orcs are more like a lawless pack of lowlifes from 
all corners of Middle Earth, holding no allegiance other than whatever 
the individual member claims.

Features:
One of the neat features is that, while all the possible titles for the
guild have the same format, the player is given the choice on what it is.
During the joining process, they are given a list of adjectives, titles,
and locations to choose from. To join, they 'claim <adj>, <title>, <loc>'.
For example: 'Altrus the Tenacious Marauder of Lugburz'
This method was chosen to give the player a greater sense of control, as
well as allowing these players who want to be orcs the chance to roleplay
an orc from a number of differnt regions of Middle Earth, instead of 
locking them into one specific role.
One other special feature is that orcs (and their uruk-hai brothers) can
speak in the black tongue. Only the orcs and uruk-hai of Middle Earth
can understand this foul language (and wizards too of course).
