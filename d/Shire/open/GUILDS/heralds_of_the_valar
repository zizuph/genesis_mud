The Heralds of the Valar are a layman guild, descended from the Hin Warrior guild run by Tricky.
This guild has many of the same spells, but the feel and history of the guild has totally changed to fit into the more Tolkienesque Shire of the present.

The fun/no frills aspect of the Hin Guild was put into the Tricksters, while this guild retained the clerical spellcasting aspects, and got emotions reflecting their status.

Important filenames:
--------------------
/d/Shire/herald/herald_soul         -> command soul for the guild.

/d/Shire/herald/herb                -> Herbalist room in the tree.
                                       Herbalist is identical to Tobold, but
                                       no training is allowed.
/d/Shire/herald/robe                -> object that adds the command soul

In case of emergency, the /d/Shire/herald/old/ dir holds backup working (hopefully!) files.
