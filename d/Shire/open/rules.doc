Shire is a special place, filled with names that examplify virtues such as honor, honesty, loyalty and courage. As a result, to live up to these high standards, Shire wizards adhere to the following rules of performance and behavior.
CHEATING: Shire wizards never cheat.
	1. Giving anything of value to mortals is strictly prohibited. This, of course, includes a wizards second character.
	2. Helping a mortal advance in any way is prohibited.
	3. Logging on two characters at one time is prohibited. (The exception to this is a test character named "wizardname jr." who never plays the game.
	4. Giving any wizinfo to mortals is prohibited. This not only includes information about quests, or other game information but also any information about other mortals. Example:email address, last time on...etc.
PLAYING SECONDS:
	1. Wizards seconds may not do any quests located in the Shire Domain.
	2. Seconds should avoid telling mortals that they are wizards.
	3. Seconds may not join any Shire guilds.
	4. Seconds are held to the same high standards concerning cheating as their firsts.
WIZARD/MORTAL INTERACTION:
	Although not prohibited, Wizard/Mortal interaction should always be with great caution.
	1. No harrassment of mortals of any kind will be tolerated.
	2. Wizards should hold themselves aloof from mortal controversies, not getting involved, nor taking sides.
	3. Wizards should not post on mortal boards, unless required by their position, such as advising about a change. When it is necessary, Wizards should use roll playing. Example "The gods have required this to be done"., etc.
	4. Wizards should never trans a mortal without their permission and transing a mortal to take him/her out of danger or to place them in a specific area to help them is strictly prohibited.
	5. Wizards, when visiting mortal areas, must be careful not to interfere with players in that area. When talking to mortals, rollplay, to them Wizards are immortals and should act as such.

Generally, just use good sense when dealing with mortals. Allow them to enjoy the game. That's why they are here.
WIZARD/WIZARD INTERACTION:
	1. Wizards should always deal respectfully with other wizards.
	2. Do not trans to another wizard, regardless of rank, without permission. The audience command is very helpful for this.
	3. In the event of a disagreement with another Wizard, attempt to compromise. If this doesn't work, seek help from your liege to reach a compromise.
	4. Enjoy the wiz line, it can be helpful and fun. But don't use it to the point of annoyance to other Wizards. Personal conversations of any duration are better on the tell line or domain line.

Wizards are reminded they have many priveleges and powers by virtue of their wizardhood. Along with these come responsibilities. Enjoy the game, and play your second for relaxation and fun, but remember we are also here to enhance the game. 
We do this by coding...adding new areas and quests..improving older areas. Wizards are expected to use a significant part of their time on the mud doing this.
