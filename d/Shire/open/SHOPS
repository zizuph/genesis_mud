Places of importance in the Shire domain (including /d/Genesis/start/hobbit...)

In this document, ~S/c refers to ~Shire/common, and hobbit/ refers to the
directory /d/Genesis/start/hobbit/, or, for those who prefer C... :)

#define hobbit/ /d/Genesis/start/hobbit/
#define ~S/c ~Shire/common

A plus sign in parentheses after a room (+) simply means it is listed under
more than one category in this file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shops:	The Shire area has three shops, one in Hobbiton, one in Bree and one in
		Moria.  None of these has any extraordinary features.  The files are:
		~S/c/bree/shop
		hobbit/shop
		moris/mines/shop

/d/Shire/common/hobbiton/farthing3

Links to other domains: ~S/c/gondorlink links the Shire to, of all places, the
                        domain Gondor.  (their room is ~Gondor/common/shirelink)
                         Also there is a link to Rhovanion, ~S/c/rhovanionlink.


Docks: The Shire presently has five rooms for ships to dock at, 
       ~S/c/greyhaven/shore, ~S/c/greyhaven/dock. ~S/c/greyhaven/pier1, 
		~S/c/greyhaven/pier2 and ~S/c/greyhaven/pier3
       Ships land at /shore from Sparkle and the Circle line and from Krynn to /dock.
		From Palanthas in pier1, from Cove on pier2 and from Kabal on pier3

Guilds: The room to join the Shire guild is ~S/c/guild/hguild(+).  The guild
        is more fully described in other files in this directory.


Training rooms: Of course, the guild room, ~S/c/guild/hguild(+), and also
                hobbit/guild(+).  I may list the skills offered in each in
                another file in this directory.  New rooms: ~S/c/bree/adv_guild and
                 ~S/mithlond/advguild


Board rooms: ~S/c/guild/hguild2 (wizzes only)
             ~S/c/guild/hguild(+)

Pubs/Inns: You can get healing items at:
           ~S/c/bree/inn
           ~S/c/greyhaven/inn
           hobbit/pub


Specialty shops: Here I list places that specialize in one or another type of
                 goods, such as weapons or armour, along with their specialty.
                 hobbit/bakery selling foods of no apparent healing value
                 hobbit/forge selling weapons/armour, and improving current ones
                 ~S/c/hobbiton/forge copy of hobbit/forge
                 hobbit/bank stores money for a fee, and changes currencies
                  ~S/c/hobbiton/cobbler - sells sandals that help rest players
                   ~S/c/bree/perfumery - sells perfumes and colognes.

Wizinfo rooms: At least 5 rooms in the Shire domain have a wizinfo function;
               they are:
               ~S/c/mount/path3
               ~S/c/bree/[esw]gate (3 files)
               hobbit/guild(+)


Banks:

For now these are the ONLY banks with gem support as it is only logical
the gnomes only put in the extra security for such endeavours where they
see chance of getting payment.
