   The Guild of the Hin Warriors is an ancient one. Our guild
   has many members, both mortals and immortals. The Guild was
   originally founded by Nob Nar. Members of the Hin Warriors
   get a magical pipe, which helps them with their most important
   target: To have fun. Hin Warriors are great smokers, real
   artists on the pipe. Since Nob Nar founded this guild in the
   Land of the Shire, all Hin Warrior titles refer to the Shires
   where the tobacco for their pipes is being grown.

   Every enlisted member of the Hin Warriors receives a magical
   pipe. The pipe gives the owner special abilities. These abilities
   will become less, if the person who owns the pipe looses his title
   somehow. The higher you climb in level, the more abilities your
   pipe will get. If you somehow managed to lose your pipe, you can
   obtain a new one by pledging alleagiance once more at the statuette
   of Nob Nar.
