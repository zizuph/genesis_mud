History of the guild of the Hin Warriors
----------------------------------------
Several ages ago a simple hobbit by the name of Nob Nar made several trips
to places outside the Shire. On his travels Nob made several friends who
joined him as he travelled around, adventuring and searching for treasures.
His friends were of all races: lightfooted elves, exellent building dwarves,
bold gnomes, strong humans and of course pipe smoking hobbits.

This smoking of the pipe-weed in pipes was taken over by all friends and the
pipe became a symbol of the group that was lead by Nob Nar. They ventured to
places that were still uncharted in those days and slayed quite a few beasts.
None of the group was a great warrior, but it was the whole group that gave
its members more fidelity, more fierceness, maybe even more strength when
fighting an opponent.

One day the group entered yellow vale, the ground burned and smelling like
sulfur. It was here that the group fought a battle that lasted a two nights
and a day with the evil four-winged two-headed dragon Hqswrin, who was a
burden on at least five gnome-villages. The people kindly referred to the
group as the Hqswrin Warriors, even though noone of the group really was a
warrior. Nob decided that he liked the idea of having a name for the group,
so he took the name. Since virtually noone of the group could say the word
Hqswrin, they took the name Hin Warriors upon them after a few weeks.

Somehow, Nob Nar had an exceptionally long life-span. In his older years he
settled down in the mountains near Hobbiton, in his favourite part of the
world. There, in the mountains he founded a home for the members of his still
growing group. Nob Nar died there of old age, and he was regarded as a god
from thereon.
