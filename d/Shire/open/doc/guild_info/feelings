   True members of the Shires have special feelings, that no other
   people have. Here are a few of them:

      bark, hiss, cringe, conf, meditate, shuffle, nude, thumb,
      nod, smile, chuckle, peer, ponder, seduce, sing, flame,
      congrat, armpit.

   If you have ideas for new feelings, use "idea <feeling & explanation>"
   in this room.
