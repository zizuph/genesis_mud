Spells and Skills
-----------------
Many people make the error of mixing up spells and skills. Spells are
the magic words a magician needs to speak to obtain a certain effect,
whereas skills determine how strong that effect will be. If one's skills
are low, casting a spell will be very tough, whereas someone with high
skills can cast spells more easily.

Skills can usually be obtained in guilds, whereas spells can be found
on scrolls, in tomes, or can be trained.

There are two types of skills: form skills and elemental skills. The
form skills determine the type of spell that one can cast. Elemental
skills determine how well one can handle the spell-ingredients.
