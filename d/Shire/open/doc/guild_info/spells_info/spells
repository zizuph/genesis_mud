Hence, spells cannot be casted without concentrating first. This will take
time. A person only has a limited capability of concentrating, so casting
spells cannot go on infinitely. If the mental exhaustion is too big, a spell
simply cannot be casted. With time the exhaustion will grow less, or one
can buy mana-restoring potions. Mana, of course, is nothing else than a
way to measure ones mental capabilities.

Spells usually need ingredients to be casted. If one has a high skill in
the field of such an ingredient, the spell will have a bigger chance to
succeed.

The same goes for the spelltype. Casting a spell that involves summoning
will have a bigger chance to succeed if the caster has a higher Conjuration
skill. It is very hard to become good at casting all spells, because that
would require to be good at many skills. The wise Aljabaar only became a
great conjurer because he was granted a very long lifespan. Most people are
not that lucky, and have to face a limited learning capability.
