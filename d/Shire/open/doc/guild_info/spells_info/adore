Spells for apprentices                            - Chapter 36

Adore
-----

One of the most basic and simple spells, that costs little concentration
is the adoration of the Founder of our guild, Nob Nar. The adoration takes
place by kneeling down and chanting holy prayers to the benefit of our
beloved Founder. As a token of appreciation, Nob Nar usually conjures
a small life-form in the same room.

This spell is easy to cast and takes benefit of the conjuration and
life elemental skills. The mental exhaustion, caused by directing
holy prayers to Nob Nar, is very low.

Cast this spell by doing:       "adore Nob Nar"
