The Tend spell
--------------
The more trained Hin Warriors will know this spell; it is not simple, yet
also not too hard to cast the tend-spell. The spell depends on the one
ingredient it needs: the Huckleberry. Though not strong, the Huckleberry
allows the caster to focus his mentals powers on the curing of the wound.

The tend-spell is a form of enchantment, and depends on life. The higher
those skills, the more chance of success in casting the spell.
