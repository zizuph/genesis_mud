The Clairvoyance spell
----------------------
One of the most often used spells is the Clairvoyance spell. With it,
sorcerors can see through the eyes of their victims. Some magicians
have need for a crystal globe to focus their powers, but more powerful
casters can simply cast the spell on anyone they know. The only needed
ingredient for this spell is parsley. It might be impossible to cast
the spell on powerfull wizards.

The clairvoyance-spell is a form of enchantment, and depends on life.
The higher those skills, the more chance of success in casting the spell
upon a victim.
