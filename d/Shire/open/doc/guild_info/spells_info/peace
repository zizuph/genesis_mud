The Peace spell
---------------
All Hin Warriors who are wise and intelligent enough know the "peace" spell.
The effect of the spell has been derived of an experiment with the rare
tree-mushroom, as conducted by Yodocus Quack the White Mage. The mushroom
draws the attentention of the Founder of our Guild, Nob Nar, who summons
one of his peace-making statues to appear in the same room. There are places
known to prevent the casting of any spell, though, in which case the spell
will fail anyway.

The success of this spell depends heavily on the conjuration and air skills,
and is heavy on the mental exhaustion. The more successfull the caster is,
the longer the statue will stay.

It is said that some alchemists can change rocks to the rare tree-mushroom,
should you not be able to locate any.
