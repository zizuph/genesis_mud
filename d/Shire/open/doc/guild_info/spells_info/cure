The Cure spell
--------------
The Cure spell is known amongst the above average wise and intelligent
Hin Warriors. The spell is hard to cast, and causes great mental exhaustion.
Like the tend-spell, this spell depends on the focussing powers of the
Huckleberry. As an extra ingredient, this spell needs the Pawnrose, to
add more strength to the spell. The person who is cured will get much
better, should the spell be successfull. Should the spell fail, then there
is a chance that either of the ingredients is lost.

The cure-spell is a form of enchantment, and depends on life. The higher
those skills, the more chance of success in casting the spell upon someone.
