   Guild Line
   ----------

   All members of our guild ought to carry their pipe with them, for
   it serves as a medium to focus their mental powers with. The pipe
   allows members for example to communicate telepathically.

   It is needless to say that this way of communicating takes some
   mental power, and using the Shireline often might result in an
   exhausted mental state. The more people receive your message,
   the more exhausting it will be. Note that receivers of the
   message are not exhausted in any way; they simply have to keep
   an open mind to receive messages.

   If receiving the messages is too much for you (it can be noisy
   sometimes), there are commands to disable your pipe so telepathic
   messages will not come through. When the silence becomes too much,
   it can be enabled again.
