   Guild Tax
   ---------

   The Hin Warrior Guild offers you additional feelings, some spells
   and also training in certain spellcasting or other skills. As a way
   of payment, a tax is deducted from your earned experience. At the
   moment this tax is 11 percent.

   The reduced amount of experience is added to your Guild status. So,
   the more experience you earn, the higher your rank within the Guild
   will be. If your Guild status rises enough, you are rewarded with a
   more impressive title. The Guild status is also used to determine
   how far you can raise certain skills in the Guild Training room.
