   The Hin Warrior Guild is basically a brotherhood that offers
   you something in return. There are a few basic rules that you
   need to follow to become a great Hin Warrior:

       (1) Only fight against worthy opponents, fight with honour.
       (2) Help out other members of our guild.
       (3) Help out newcomers, even if they are not a member.
       (4) Do not disgrace yourself and thus the Hin Warriors.

   Be warned that joining our guild will cost you about 11% tax!

   If you join our guild, be aware that there is a price for
   leaving it. To leave our Guild you must sacrifice a valuable
   weapon or armour. If you are not sure about joining the Guild,
   come back when you are sure that our Guild is the right choice.
   If you want to join, go to the room across the hall and type

                   "pledge allegiance"
