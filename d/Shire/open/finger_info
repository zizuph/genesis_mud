The Shire is the home of hobbits, elves, humans orcs, trolls, and things unspeakable. The borders range from Moria in the south to the Grey Mountains of the north and beyond. The Shire also stretches from the Grey Havens in the west and over the Misty Mountains to the east. We also encompass Mirkwood, the Lonely Mountain and the old Rhovanion domain.

Presently, we are updating the domain and developing new and exciting things and places for mortals to enjoy. But, as always, we are open to new ideas and suggestions to make the domain more enjoyable for players. Our goal is to provide a place where all levels of players can come, from the smallest newbie to the largest hero.

Like the Gondor domain, the Shire is based on Tolkien's rich books. They provide places with little characterization and hints of much more. If you are interested in adding to the rich environment of the Shire, contact the liege of Gondor for more information.
