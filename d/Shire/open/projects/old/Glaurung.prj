     As the current guildmaster for the Smiths most of his time is
occupied by finding ways to improve the guild. Feel free to
approach him at any time if you have a relevant topic to discuss.
He would like to see more mortal take an interest in coding where
they have the opportunity to breathe life into countless creations,
limited only by their imagination, as well as help with the typo log ;)
