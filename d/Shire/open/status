A Status report for the domain Shire

Created by Odin, 11.03.95

We are currently working on several projects. 

The main project 
which has to be finished first is the Great East Road. It should
include the whole road from Mithlond to the Trollshaws, with the
villages placed around it, Whitfurrows, Waymeet, gamwich and 
other small villages according to the Middle Earth Athlas.
The East Road should have several herb fields, as shire is an
area known for its heavy herb growth.
Have come quite a bit here. Elix claims to be mostly finished
with his parts and has declared that he can take over work from
others who havent got time for it. Odin has done most of his 
parts, but isn't quite finished yet. Shanna has finished
her portion of eastroad from the Last Bridge to the ford to
Rivendell, but is still working on the rooms surrounding the
road. This includes an elf tree-top village near Rivendell
and a rocky road..through a ravine..next to eastroad..the road
that Frodo and party took to get to Rivendell when chased by 
the nazguls. And also a path through heavy, dark woods next
to eastroad.
Vadiem: Unknown, Dondon: Unknown

Also being worked on is Rivendell, with the ford,
Elronds house, healers of Imladris and the elves there.
Detailed status report will come later.
shanna is working with the ford and Elronds house.
Odin will concentrate on the healers guild.

Rhudaur with mainly wilderness, but also the trollshaws (Have been
made but needs update) heavily infested with trolls exist there.
There can also be found a few ruins there, forts left after Angmar
broke apart the Kingdom of Rhudaur exist, border-forts along the 
borders with the other leftover-kingdoms from Arnor.
Is started but not advancing much currently due to time lack.
